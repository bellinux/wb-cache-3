5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control {{room in a}} van and created a mobile recording studio {{so that they would}} not be limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by. The band lent the <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> out to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, which used it to record Led Zeppelin III(1970) andLed Zeppelin IV(1971).|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio.</b> Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

5|$|The group {{started work}} on the album in 1972, trying to follow up Tommy and Who's Next, which had both {{achieved}} substantial critical and commercial success. Recording was delayed while bassist John Entwistle and singer Roger Daltrey recorded solo albums and drummer Keith Moon worked on films. Because a new studio was not finished in time, the group had to use Ronnie Lane's <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio.</b> As well as the group's typical playing styles, especially from Moon, the album makes significant use of Townshend's multi-tracked synthesizers and sound effects, and Entwistle's layered horn parts. Relationships between the group and manager Kit Lambert broke down irretrievably during recording and {{he had left the}} band's services by the time the album was released.|$|E

25|$|The {{recording}} of the album and the film took place during three nights of concerts at New York's Madison Square Garden, during the band's 1973 North American tour. All songs were recorded by Eddie Kramer using the Wally Heider <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio</b> truck, and later mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York and Trident Studios in London.|$|E

25|$|After {{achieving}} {{his musical}} goals with Juniper, Rice became {{frustrated with the}} artistic compromises required by the record label, and he left the band in 1998. Rice moved to Tuscany in Italy and took up farming for some time, then returned to Ireland before busking around Europe. After returning to Ireland a second time, Rice gave a demo recording to his second cousin, music producer David Arnold who then gave Rice a <b>mobile</b> <b>studio.</b>|$|E

The 1970s superstar Tom Jones played {{one of his}} final UK concerts at the Paget Rooms before moving to America.

25|$|During May 1978 Tench joined Eric Burdon {{to record}} the album Darkness Darkness, at Roundwood House in County Leix Ireland. The album was {{released}} nearly two years later. The album was recorded using Ronnie Lane's <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio</b> and with a lineup also including guitarists Brian Robertson from Thin Lizzy and Henry McCullough recently departed from Wings, also Mick Weaver from Traffic. He performed with Burdon in concerts during this time, before joining Streetwalkers guitarist Charlie Whitney's band Axis Point as a guitarist and vocalist to record Axis Point (1979).|$|E
25|$|Lange focused {{particular}} attention on Johnson's vocals, demanding perfection {{out of each}} take. Near {{the end of the}} process, the band phoned manager Ian Jeffery in search of a bell to include on the album. Jeffery located a foundry to produce the bell, but with seven weeks having already gone by, he suggested Platt record a nearby church's bells. These recordings did not suffice due to the sound of a flurry of birds flying away at each bell hit. The foundry brought forward production on the bell, which turned out perfectly tuned, and it was recorded with Ronnie Lane's <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio.</b> Following the recording's completion, the group mixed Back in Black at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 1977 in Barnstaple, Brock and Calvert had {{performed}} a one-off gig with Devon band Ark as the Sonic Assassins, {{and looking for}} a new project in 1978, bassist Harvey Bainbridge and drummer Martin Griffin were recruited from this event. Steve Swindells was recruited as keyboard player. The band was named Hawklords, (probably for legal reasons, the band having recently split from their management), and recording took place on a farm in Devon using a <b>mobile</b> <b>studio,</b> resulting in the album 25 Years On. King had originally been the drummer for the project but quit during recording sessions to return to London, while House, who had temporarily left the band to join a David Bowie tour, elected to remain with Bowie full-time, but nevertheless contributed violin to these sessions. At the end of the band's UK tour, Calvert, wanting King back in the band, dismissed Griffin, then promptly resigned himself, choosing to pursue a career in literature. Swindells left to record a solo album after an offer had been made to him by the record company ATCO.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the merger}} in 2003, Square Enix has {{acquired}} a number of companies, as well as creating several subsidiary companies. To strengthen its wireless market, Square Enix acquired mobile application developer UIEvolution in March 2004, though it was sold in December 2007, and the company instead founded its own Square Enix MobileStudio in January 2008 to focus on mobile products. In January 2005 Square Enix founded Square Enix China, expanding their interests in the People's Republic of China. In September of that year Square Enix bought the gaming developer and publisher Taito, renowned for their arcade hits such as Space Invaders and the Bubble Bobble series; Taito's home and portable console games divisions were merged into Square Enix itself by March 2010. In August 2008, Square Enix made plans for a similar expansion {{by way of a}} friendly takeover of video game developer Tecmo by purchasing shares at a 30 percent premium, but Tecmo rejected the proposed takeover. Instead, in February 2009, Square Enix announced a takeover deal for Eidos plc, the holding company for Eidos Interactive, the UK-based publisher of the Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex, Thief and Legacy of Kain franchises, along with its multiple subsidiary development studios which developed the games The acquisition of Eidos was completed in April 2009, and in November the publisher was merged with Square Enix's European publishing organization to form Square Enix Europe. In March 2011 Square Enix founded another mobile development studio, Hippos Lab, followed by another in 2012, Square Enix Montréal. A third <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> was founded in Indonesia in June 2013, Smileworks, but was closed in January 2015. The latest subsidiary company to be created was Shinra Technologies, a cloud gaming company, but it was only in existence from September 2014 to January 2016. In 2015, Square created a new studio known as Tokyo RPG Factory to develop what was then dubbed Project Setsuna. On February 21, 2017, the formation of new studio Studio Istolia was announced. The studio, headed by Hideo Baba, would be working on the new RPG Project Prelude Rune.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Jagger bought [...] "Stargroves", a {{manor house}} and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones {{and several other}} bands {{recorded}} there using the Rolling Stones <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio.</b> Led Zeppelin, used the <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> to record material for the albums Physical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy. Dire Straits, Lou Reed, Bob Marley, Horslips, Fleetwood Mac, Bad Company, Status Quo, Iron Maiden and Wishbone Ash all recorded within the <b>mobile</b> <b>studio.</b> The Who recorded [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] in Stargroves itself. The Rolling Stones <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> was also used to record the Deep Purple song, [...] "Smoke on the Water". The lyrics to the song, which they had not intended to release, mention the <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> and were intended as a joke about it almost being {{burned to the ground}} by a nearby fire. In order to rescue the mobile from the first started by a flare gun, the Stones crew had to smash a window and release the parking brake to roll it out of the way. Deep Purple referred to it as the [...] "Rolling truck Stones thing" [...] in the song, stating previously in the song [...] "We all came out to Montreux ... to make records with a mobile." [...] The mobile is currently owned by the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|$|E
500|$|The Who {{recorded}} Who's Next {{with assistance}} from recording engineer Glyn Johns. After producing the song [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] in the Rolling Stones <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio,</b> they relocated to Olympic Studios to record and mix {{most of the}} album's remaining songs. They made prominent use of the synthesizer on the album, particularly on [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] and [...] "Baba O'Riley", which were both released as singles. The cover photo was shot by Ethan Russell and made reference to the monolith in the 1968 film , as it featured group members having urinated against a concrete piling protruding from a slag heap.|$|E

500|$|The group gave {{a further}} series of concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were {{recorded}} on the Rolling Stones <b>Mobile</b> <b>Studio</b> by Andy Johns, but Townshend grew disillusioned with Lifehouse and further shows were cancelled. The project {{proved to be}} intractable on several levels and caused stress within the band {{as well as a}} major falling out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the project led him to the verge of a nervous breakdown. Audiences at the Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play [...] "My Generation" [...] and smash a guitar. At the time, Roger Daltrey said the Who [...] "were never nearer to breaking up".|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} album's writing stage, Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden, and was {{replaced}} by Janick Gers. Iron Maiden's eighth studio release, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying, had a raw sound that, according to AllMusic, did not [...] "hold up well" [...] compared to past efforts, as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with a <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> owned by the Rolling Stones. The record featured Dickinson's [...] "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter", originally composed for , which despite receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for worst original song in 1989, became the band's first and only single to top the UK Singles Chart. By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, Fear of the Dark, was recorded there, resulting in a better overall sound than No Prayer for the Dying, although Dickinson still claims it had limitations due to its size.|$|E
500|$|RCA, {{which had}} enjoyed {{a steady stream}} of product from Presley for over a decade, grew anxious as his {{interest}} in spending time in the studio waned. After a December 1973 session that produced 18 songs, enough for almost two albums, he did not enter the studio in 1974. Parker sold RCA on another concert record, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis. Recorded on March 20, it included a version of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] that would win Presley his third and final competitive Grammy Award. (All three of his competitive Grammy wins—out of 14 total nominations—were for gospel recordings.) Presley returned to the studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session {{toward the end of the}} year were unsuccessful. In 1976, RCA sent a <b>mobile</b> <b>studio</b> to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's home. Even in that comfortable context, the recording process was now a struggle for him.|$|E
