5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The first is a feature that allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game. The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{teamed up}} with London based music {{production}} company Crossfade Cartel owned by Ofei Sakyi and Dan Neil to ensure {{the overall quality of}} the soundtrack. The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music sequencer program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero.|$|E
5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Rolf Krake was {{initially}} armed with four Swedish-built 68-poounder smoothbore guns, one pair in each gun turret. The hand-operated turrets took {{a crew of}} 18 men one <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a full revolution.|$|R
50|$|The top six athletes {{qualified}} for the final. For reasons unrecorded in the IPC database, E. Cox of the United States took over a <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the 60 m race - {{more than four times}} as long as any other competitor.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Cattrall {{revealed}} that in December 1988 {{she had been}} booked on Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, after a terrorist bomb was detonated during the flight. She cancelled her booking on the flight at the last <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> some Christmas shopping in London.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Firmware 2.7 on April 25, 2006, a {{downloadable}} demo of LocoRoco was released on the game's Japanese website {{and was the first}} Sony-sanctioned user-downloadable game for the PSP. A demo localized for western countries was released in June 2006, shortly before the game's full European release. It includes one level that will take the player around 5–15 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> depending on the number of secret areas the player encounters. A special Halloween-themed demo was released for download on October 26, 2006, It featured some exclusive graphics and objects, like Jack-o-lanterns, spirits, and more. Few puzzles were implemented. A Christmas-themed demo was released for download on December 11, 2006. It featured some exclusive graphics like Santa's sleigh and more. A unique LocoRoco song is implemented.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so {{he was not able to}} bat in Australia's first innings, in which Harvey made 43 before being run out. In the second innings, Harvey caught Surrey captain Errol Holmes from a leaping catch, snaffling the ball as it flew through a flock of pigeons. On the final day, Australia wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final. Harvey volunteered to play as a {{makeshift}} opener alongside Sam Loxton and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly. Australia chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs. Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time for the championship-deciding match.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss {{and sent}} Surrey in to bat. They made 221, and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort {{in which there}} were six single-figure scores. As the match started {{the day after the}} Second Test, Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers, and Ring took three wickets, while the Test players only took two in total. Hamence opened the batting for Australia—Brown injured a finger while fielding—but he was out for a duck. Hassett (139) and Bradman (128) then put on 231, Bradman making his sixth century of the tour. However, the Australians lost wickets {{steadily}} thereafter to be all out for 389. Surrey made 289 in their second innings, with McCool taking 6/113 after bowling more than 40% of the overs. The hosts batted steadily with three fifties, but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised. The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final. Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs. Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time.|$|E
50|$|Alwyn scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2012-13 season against ONGC on 1 December 2012 to help Pailan win 4-1.On 6 April 2013, he headed in a cross from the left by Seminlen Doungel on the 74th <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a 2-0 upset of {{defending}} champions Dempo at the Tilak Maidan Stadium.|$|R
5000|$|Erwin G. [...] "Cannonball" [...] Baker rode a Neracar from Staten Island, New York, to Los Angeles, California, in {{the autumn}} of 1922. The journey of 3,364.4 miles took 174 hours and one <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> with {{operating}} costs totalling $15.70 at the time. Baker later started a Neracar dealership in Los Angeles.|$|R
30|$|Stage 1 - MMS were {{collected}} for 111 patients over a 2 day period. All participating physiotherapists and nursing staff {{reported that the}} MMS took less than 1 <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> and was easy to use. The inter-rater reliability was excellent with all 3 assessors assigning the same MMS score for every patient (Kappa value = 1).|$|R
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E
25|$|Mondays to Saturdays, {{services}} run at six to eight-minute intervals {{during the}} day. Evening and Sunday service is at fifteen-minute intervals. Trams take 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the route.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2007, the Prairie South {{school board}} voted to close five schools {{by the end}} of August. They {{included}} Briercrest, Limerick, Crane Valley, École Ross and Willow Bunch. The special meeting of the board took only 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Silencers {{was finally}} printed by Image Comics as City of Silence, and Ellis and Erskine finally saw the story receive {{critical}} acclaim. The same year saw him ink Chris Weston {{on an issue}} of War Story written by Garth Ennis, as well as drawing two issues of Hellblazer for Vertigo. He also stepped in at the last <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> Mark Millars run of The Authority.|$|R
50|$|The XT BIOS {{added a few}} {{technical}} improvements {{over the}} 5150 BIOS, including displaying a memory count during the POST instead of a blank screen. In the interest of faster booting (a fully loaded 5150 with 640k could take over half a <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the POST memory scan), the XT BIOS only attempts to read one bit each from the leftmost chip in each bank and if so, assumes that bank is filled.|$|R
50|$|Each {{track is}} between 260 and 425 metres long {{and it takes}} {{approximately}} one <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> four laps. For example, 10 time Australian Champion Leigh Adams set a record time of 59 seconds on a 342 m track and produced an average speed of 83 km/h (49 mph). The speed on straight sections of the track reaches 110 km/h (70 mph) or more on longer tracks, but the limited speed on curves lowers the average.|$|R
25|$|Nasal {{endoscopy}} involves {{inserting a}} flexible fiber-optic tube {{with a light}} and camera at its tip into the nose to examine the nasal passages and sinuses. This is generally a completely painless (although uncomfortable) procedure which takes between five and ten <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E
25|$|Law Walk is Kings Park's premier urban bushland trail. It is a 2.5km loop {{walk that}} begins at Rotunda Two and {{continues}} {{along the ridge}} of the limestone escarpment to Dryandra Lookout. A loop in the trail then leads to the Lotterywest Federation Walkway {{and back to the}} start of Law Walk, taking visitors approximately 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were 36 cars, each {{fitted with}} 40 {{revolving}} chairs {{and able to}} accommodate up to 60 people, giving a total capacity of 2,160. The wheel carried some 38,000 passengers daily and took 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> two revolutions, the first involving six stops to allow passengers to exit and enter and the second a nine-minute non-stop rotation, for which the ticket holder paid 50 cents.|$|E
50|$|Hotshot {{can also}} be a tournament. In tournaments the game is {{different}} from normal in a few ways. First players have only a <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> their turn, and must get their own rebounds on every shot and hotspots are worth different amounts of points depending on their distance from the basket. Also, offspot rounds are generally not part of tournaments. Players may get a bonus if they finish their round in less than a minute.|$|R
50|$|The {{funicular}} {{was built}} in 1890 {{and has been in}} operation since April 23, 1893. It has two cars for 28 passengers each. It runs on 1200 mm gauge rails, track length is only 66 m, but height difference is 30.5 m and inclination 52%. This makes it one of the shortest, but also one of the steepest funiculars in the world. It runs at a speed of 1.5 m/s, needing 1 <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the trip.|$|R
6000|$|Hundreds of dressed deodar logs {{had caught}} on a snag of rock, and the river was {{bringing}} down more logs every <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the blockade. The water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber, while {{the population of the}} state prodded at the nearest logs with poles, in the hope of easing the pressure. Then there went up a shout of [...] "Namgay Doola! Namgay Doola!" [...] and a large, red-haired villager hurried up, stripping off his clothes as he ran.|$|R
25|$|States and {{nationals}} {{include a}} ciphering round {{that is not}} present at other competitions. Students are given a stack of ten questions. They have three <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> each question. For solving {{it in the first}} minute, they receive twelve points, during the second minute, eight points, and during the third minute, four points. At the competitions with this test, it is included along with the individual test scores and team score for the total team score.|$|E
25|$|The Shooting Stars Competition is competed by {{four teams}} of three players each. In this competition, each team must make six shots from six {{shooting}} locations of increasing difficulties. Each team has {{to select a}} specific player rotation to follow throughout the competition. Each shot must be made before the next player begins shooting in succession. The teams will have two <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the course and the team who makes all six shots with the fastest time wins the competition.|$|E
25|$|Administering the Test: HTP {{is given}} to persons above {{the age of three}} and takes {{approximately}} 150 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> based on the person's level of mental functioning. During the first phase, the test-taker is asked to draw the house, tree, and person and the test-giver asks questions each picture. There are 60 questions originally designed by Buck but art therapists and trained test administrators can also design their own questions, or ask follow up questions. This phase is done with a crayon.|$|E
40|$|Radiopertechnetate renography merits {{consideration}} {{as another}} intravenous screening procedure for renovascular hypertension. Thus far {{in our experience}} it has yielded fewer falsely negative results than the radiohippurate renogram, and it takes less than one <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> Applications of this method to the assessment of renal perfusion in other renal afflictions are described. The examination requires a stationary imaging device interfaced with a storage device and a data processor. It {{has the advantage of}} providing a comparison of renal transit of the test agent with its transit through the systemic circulation, e. g. the aorta...|$|R
50|$|The {{player has}} {{to build a}} farm by {{matching}} three items, but not necessarily in a row. The game allows the player to move in eight directions rather than four which allows for more strategies. There are twenty-six levels featured per mission and four difficulty settings and chain reactions which can be turned off to increase difficulty. The game features two distinct modes, Blitz Mode in which players have a whole <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the mission and Alaska Mode in which the players fight against an ever freezing ground.|$|R
50|$|Al Burleson {{returned}} an interception 93 {{yards for a}} touchdown and Warren Moon connected with Spider Gaines for a 78-yard touchdown pass with less than a <b>minute</b> left <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the comeback victory in the Apple Cup.|$|R
25|$|It was {{initially}} a single line, later duplicated from Rozelle to Ryde between 1906 and 1936. The tram terminus was {{established at the}} western end of Blaxland Road, located near the current Top Ryde City shopping centre, and extended down Victoria Road through Gladesville, where it eventually terminated at Fort Macquarie (present site of the Sydney Opera House). The entire trip took approximately 61 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> and was the single longest route on the Sydney tram network, measuring 10 miles 61 chains (17.3km) via Pyrmont.|$|E
25|$|Before a {{recipient}} receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between {{donor and recipient}} blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient's blood. Typing of recipient's blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with donor blood. It takes about 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for special requirements of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) {{and the history of}} the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other serological anomalies.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} spacewalk, Williams {{was outside the}} station for 6 hours and 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by Kathryn C. Thornton for most spacewalk time by a woman. On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16, Peggy Whitson surpassed Williams, with a {{cumulative}} EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes. In early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.|$|E
40|$|The York University CLIPS Student Administrator (YUCSA), {{an expert}} {{database}} system implemented in C Language Integrated Processing System (CLIPS), for monitoring {{the academic performance}} of undergraduate students at York University, is discussed. The expert system component in the system has already been implemented for two major departments, and it is under testing and enhancement for more departments. Also, more elaborate user interfaces are under development. We describe the design and implementation of the system, problems encountered, and immediate future plans. The system has excellent maintainability and it is very efficient, taking less than one <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> an assessment of one student...|$|R
50|$|Sears {{featured}} {{in all of}} West Ham's January 2011 fixtures, but fell out of favour, before returning to action for the Hammer's 5-1 FA Cup win against Burnley on 21 February. Having started the game, Sears scored in the 90th <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the scoring for his side and seal {{their place in the}} quarter-finals. Although Sears had a resurgence in form, breaking back into the West Ham starting eleven, West Ham were relegated from the Premier League, finishing the season in 20th position. Sears ended his season with two goals in 15 games for the Hammers.|$|R
30|$|Self-reported daytime {{sleepiness}} {{was measured}} using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The KSS gives an indication of current sleepiness {{and is one of}} the most widely used scales for measuring self-reported sleepiness. It consists of a simple 9 -point Likert scale, from 1 : very alert to 9 : fighting sleep, in which the participant is asked to indicate their feelings of sleepiness during the 5  min prior <b>to</b> <b>completing</b> the rating. It takes less than a <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> The KSS has been validated against objective measures of sleepiness (alpha and theta EEG activity) [37] as well as the Karolinska Drowsiness tests, alpha attenuation tests and performance variables such as the PVT [38].|$|R
