5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as {{would be used to}} treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of the Evans' method, the chiral {{auxiliary}} appended is an oxazolidinone, and the resulting carbonyl compound is an imide. A number of oxazolidinones are now readily available in both enantiomeric forms. These <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> roughly $10–$20 US dollars per gram, rendering them relatively expensive. However, enantiopure oxazolidinones are derived in 2 synthetic steps from comparatively inexpensive amino acids, which means that large-scale syntheses can be made more economical by in-house preparation. This usually involves borohydride mediated reduction of the acid moiety, followed by condensation/cyclisation of the resulting amino alcohol with a simple carbonate ester such as diethylcarbonate.|$|E
25|$|Many surgery {{procedures}} {{performed in}} medical tourism destinations cost {{a fraction of}} the price they do in other countries. For example, in the United States, a liver transplant that <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> $300,000 USD, would generally cost about $91,000 USD in Taiwan. A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems often have long wait times for certain operations, for example, an estimated 782,936 Canadian patients spent an average waiting time of 9.4 weeks on medical waiting lists in 2005. Canada has also set waiting time benchmarks for non urgent medical procedures, including a 26-week waiting period for a hip replacement and a 16-week wait for cataract surgery.|$|E

A cubic meter of water {{supplied}} by a water tanker <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> {{as much as}} 6 Riyals (US$1.50), or about 20 times more than water supplied through the network. Citizens who are not connected to the piped network, who are often poor, pay up to 40 times more for water than connected households. The monthly water bill is about 1 Riyal (US$0.27), compared to an average mobile phone bill of 200 Riyals. The price of a 19 cubic meter tank is 150 SR, {{and the price of}} a 30 cubic meter tank is 180 SR. Although price may change during holidays and peak seasons, and not all cities are the same.|$|E

25|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury {{of a human being}} in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> over US$400,000.|$|E
25|$|Owing to its notoriety and {{invasive}} behaviour, red imported {{fire ants}} {{are considered to}} be pests. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration estimates more than $5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in infested areas. They can also cause $2.5 billion in damages annually in just 20 years. In Texas alone, red imported fire ants caused $300 million in damages for livestock, wildlife and public health. Approximately $36 per American household, and more than $250 million has been spent to control and eradicate red imported fire ants. Private agencies spend $25 to $40 million on pesticides annually. Unsuccessful eradication in Australia <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> the economy billions in damages annually and, based on a Queensland government study, the estimated cost could reach $43 billion over 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house <b>may</b> <b>cost</b> well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E
40|$|In imperfectly {{competitive}} markets {{firms with}} high costs produce positive output.
