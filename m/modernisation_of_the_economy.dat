40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of international migration {{is among the}} most promi-nent global demographic processes currently taking place and influencing both the economic and social situation worldwide. An intensive emigration is a matter of serious concern for such a small country as Lithuania. Firstly, emigration further exacerbates the current negative demographic indicators (low birth rate, high mor-tality rate, stagnant average lifespan), which, on the whole, leads to a decrease in the absolute number of the population. Secondly, emigration of persons of working age, leaving behind the population that lacks the capacity for work, reduces the state budget and social security budget revenues. Thirdly, departure of well-educat-ed and competent citizens from the country results in the shrinking of the country’s intellectual potential and diminishing of possibilities of mastering and develop-ment of high technologies, innovations and <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> The authors of the article point out the threat posed by emigration to Lithuania’s socio-economic development and present a comprehensive analysis of the demographic structure of the population: by sex and age, the population ageing tendency, the causes and consequences of emigration. The goal of the article is to raise the issue of emigration from Lithuania and to manifest its impact on the socio-economic development of the country.

40|$|Given {{the poor}} {{state of the}} {{infrastructure}} in Russia, the <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is an absolute priority for the Russian authorities. The use of outdated industrial equipments makes of Russia {{one of the most}} energy intensive countries in the world. It is therefore {{one of the most important}} emitters of CO 2. Moreover, its high energy intensity affects European energy security by reducing the availability of Russian gas for export. A contrario, energy savings in Russia could contribute to European security of supply and to the international CO 2 emission reduction objectives of the European Union. This thesis analyses the role that European energy companies could play in the modernisation of the most important gas consumer and CO 2 emitter in Russia: the electricity production sector. It proposes an analysis of the regulation that the Russian authorities have developed to attract investments in the refurbishment of the electricity infrastructure. This thesis defends the view that the success of this modernisation policy will depend on the stability of the “rules of the game” for investors. Given the strategic importance of the electricity sector, the risks of regulatory changes or of state interference are considerable. The investment protection treaties that Russia has signed contain important guarantees that European investors could invoke against state interference with their investments. These treaties are however also characterised with important flaws. In the context of the current negotiations on a new EU-Russian energy regime, this thesis makes recommendations to improve the protection of energy efficiency investments. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{demand and}} demand conditions for innovation {{as well as}} demand based policies for innovation {{in the context of}} the EU CEE countries. Far from regarding demand policies as a simplistic silver bullet, this paper argues that the EU CEEC catch up process could potentially be accelerated through a more explicit and systematic orientation towards demand for innovation - rather than focusing on supply side conditions. This could at the same time be linked to a better satisfaction of needs of the society and industry alike. The main argument of the paper is that institutional adaptations and a policy mix that tackles the bottlenecks of demand for innovation and supports the articulation of demand can link <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and the public services with innovation impulses for the EU CEEC economies and contribute to a tailored catching up process. The paper first introduces the current wider context of demand based innovation policies at EU level, presents a conceptualisation of demand based innovation policy and introduces a typology of demand measures. In its empirical section, it starts with the EU CEEC innovation capabilities as a context for demand based innovation policies and argues that our current understanding of the innovation capabilities and conditions fall short when it comes to capture the demand side. The core of the paper discusses some alternative variables to map demand conditions in the EU CEEC and links this discussion with concrete policy challenges. Subsequently, for the sake of illustration, the paper summarises the (still very poor) policy trends towards including the demand side in policy design and implementation in the EU CEE countries. This is illustrative, the paper does not and cannot claim to analyse all demand dimensions in existing policies. The paper finishes with policy challenges and gives a set of policy recommendations to move towards a broader, more balanced mix of policies better suited to tackle the specific situations in the EU CEEC...|$|E

40|$|The Lisbon European Council of March 2000 asked Member States and the Commission to {{take steps}} to make a decisive impact on the {{eradication}} of poverty by 2010. It also agreed that Member States should co-ordinate their policies for combating poverty and social exclusion on the basis of an open method of co-ordination combining common objectives, national action plans, common indicators with the aim of promoting more ambitious and effective policy strategies for social inclusion. In this context Member States have prepared a second generation of National Action Plans against poverty and social exclusion (NAPs Inclusion). These constitute a strong political acknowledgement, three years after the Lisbon Summit, of the continuing challenge to ensure social inclusion across the European Union. They represent a renewed commitment to the Union's social goals and a reiteration by Member States that <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> should go hand in hand with efforts to reduce poverty and fight against exclusion. They underline that this should be the case even at a time of economic constraints and difficulties. The NAPs inclusion are an important contribution to the modernisation of the European social model. In this approach, relatively high levels of investment in policies to promote social inclusion and social cohesion are recognised as also making an important contribution to achieving sustainable economic and employment growth. This view is reinforced {{by the fact that the}} most socially progressive countries within the Union are also among the most economically advanced. However, in pursuing economic growth, it is clear from the NAPs/inclusion that those countries starting from a lower level of development are also giving priority to social development and recognise this as an integral part of achieving economic as well as social progress. Thus it is clear that relatively high levels of social investment are making and will continue to make a significant contribution to the achievement of the Union's overall strategic goal of becoming, by 2010, "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion". This emphasises the mutually reinforcing role of social, employment and economic policies, the importance of which is highlighted by the Lisbon Strategy...|$|E
40|$|The Indonesian {{public is}} {{becoming}} increasingly concerned about the gap between policy rhetoric and action. A strong contributor to {{this has been a}} long-running corruption saga involving a tax official, Gayus Tambunan, whose activities have helped confirm the public's worst fears about the ineffectiveness of the anti-corruption campaign. Claims of progress in this and other fields, including the economy, are often overstated, and opinion polls suggest that people are increasingly unwilling to take them at face value. Nevertheless, the most recent data reveal a surprising surge of GDP growth, driven mainly by investment spending. Inflation has been quite steady for the last six months, albeit a little above the target range; this is disappointing, but not a major problem. In response to surging food prices the government has temporarily removed tariffs on rice, wheat and soybeans, and ordered increased rice imports. Energy subsidies continue to weigh heavily on the budget; the plan to remove the subsidy from petrol used in private cars but not from that used in motor cycles makes good political - if not economic - sense, since motor cycle owners greatly outnumber car owners. The 2011 budget is unlikely to have a stimulatory impact. The composition of exports has altered quite dramatically over the last two decades, albeit in unexpected directions. The pattern of export destinations has also undergone significant change, reflecting the growing relative importance of Asia to the global economy. The president's proposal for a new capital as the solution to the congestion problem in Jakarta is questionable. If policy makers fail to understand why existing cities perform their diverse functions poorly, {{the creation of a new}} capital is more likely to replicate than to solve problems. Cities are crucial to the <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and are important vehicles for poverty reduction. City governments could greatly improve their performance by adopting a strategy of financial self-reliance. The decision to establish a single authority to supervise the entire financial sector has now been delayed for almost 11 years. The draft law currently under discussion suggests that the central bank has no intention of giving up its role as supervisor of the banks. This means there would be wasteful and confusing duplication of that function in the new authority. In any case, it remains unclear exactly what purpose the authority's establishment is intended to achieve. There have been several reminders recently of Indonesia's vulnerability to natural disasters, including multiple eruptions of Mount Merapi in central Java, which caused almost 400 fatalities and considerable damage to the local economy and infrastructure. Evacuation of residents of the area worst affected seems to have been handled well. An important policy decision needs to be made about whether those who lost their houses, crops and livestock should be permitted to return permanently to their villages. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the early}} years of {{transition}} output fell dramatically in almost all transition economies. However, the Uzbek experience was an exception to this rule. Output fell only slightly, soon to be followed by small but positive and persistent economic growth. This extraordinary performance, known as the Uzbek Puzzle, was explained in the literature by favourable economic conditions such as the dominance of agricultural production, the low level of initial industrialisation and the rich natural resource base. 1 An alternative explanation of the Puzzle is that the relative resilience of the Uzbek economy during the early period of transition and its reasonably stable performance since the mid 1990 s was due to the style of economic management which the Uzbek policy-makers adopted at the time. 2 This paper analyses the economic performance of Uzbekistan since independence. We look at initial conditions, reform choice strategy and structure of the economy and its performance. The main concern of the Uzbek authorities during the early period of transition was the prevention of dramatic output loss, strong social protection and <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> through strengthening the industrial sector. In a way, these multiple objectives influenced the authorities’ choice of reform strategy. While announcing their commitment to market reforms, they had to keep firm control over priority sectors of the economy. This meant that, although reforms in small-scale enterprise and retail sectors were fast and successful, the centralised control over the ‘commanding heights’ of the economy was never truly abolished. To finance ambitious investment projects in priority sectors by simultaneously maintaining production in ailing enterprises, the government needed considerable financial resources, which were partly and endogenously created by the state-controlled banking sector, and partly attracted from abroad. In addition to this, considerable amounts of resources were reallocated from the agricultural and energy sectors to the priority sectors of the economy through old-fashioned strategies of price controls and other direct administrative methods. We argue that the current semi-centralised structure of the economy leads to misallocation of scarce resources, damages property rights and reduces the market incentive mechanism, which in the end breeds inefficiency. Although the centralised management system played the foremost role in explaining the extraordinary performance of the economy in {{the early years}} of transition, the continuation of these policies created unfavourable conditions for the long-term prospects of the Uzbek economy. Therefore, under the current regime it will not be possible to realise the true potential of the economy. The introduction of further reforms that can facilitate transition to a market economy and transform banking and financial institutions, will be the key, at this stage, to achieving sustainable economic growth in the future. The paper is organised as follows. First, the initial conditions of the Uzbek economy before transition will be discussed briefly. We will then examine the country’s choice of reform strategy and path of transition. Along the lines of these arguments, we will then discuss the current structure and functioning of the economy and highlight some important issues such as resource allocation, price distortions, and the degree of centralisation in the economic process. Finally a summary and conclusions will be p...|$|E
40|$|Airports are {{powerful}} institutions and infrastructures defining and shaping the relations and connectivities {{of a world}} of flows and mobilities.

40|$|The study „A Cost-Benefit Assessment of Romania’s Accession to the European Union”, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{programme}} Pre-Accession Impact Studies II {{that was}} coordinated by <b>the</b> European Institute <b>of</b> Romania, tries {{to offer a}} partial image of an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> qualitative and quantitative impact of Romania’s potential integration into the EU in the short, medium and long run. The {{focus is on the}} quantification and analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformations and effects induced by Romania’s accession to the European Union in terms of generated costs and benefits. The main cost categories directly associated with the accession to the European Union may be grouped in costs related to <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European norms and policies, costs related to the conformation with and implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standards, costs <b>of</b> assuming <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> European Union member and costs related to <b>the</b> <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian <b>economy.</b> <b>The</b> main benefits <b>of</b> Romania’s accession to the European Union are generated from supplementation and diversification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial resources, from acceleration of reforms and support for the transition through <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> fundamental elements for <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national economic policies and from <b>the</b> intrinsic status <b>of</b> an EU Member. <b>The</b> impact analysis <b>of</b> Romania’s integration process has been performed separately for the pre-accession and post-accession periods. Also, the scenarios considered in the impact assessment must be differentially conceived, one considering integration as granted, the other one trying to postpone <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> foreseen integration into the EU. The study uses both qualitative analyses and quantitative mathematic-economic modelling tools to assess the possible changes at sectorial level, as well as at macroeconomic national level. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> these analyses are presented at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> this document...|$|R
40|$|There is a group {{called the}} Galesh in the Alborz mountains of the {{northern}} provinces, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan, Iran, whose {{language and culture}} is severely endangered due to <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local <b>economy</b> and lifestyle. <b>The</b> Galesh are herdsmen, who previously lived a semi-nomadic gender segregated life. The wives and children settled in the nearest village, and only the men went to the their workplace or in search of new seasonal pastures for their cows.   This monograph is a documentation of five life stories from a Galesh community in <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Ziarat, situated in <b>the</b> Province <b>of</b> Golestan, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caspian Sea in Iran.  Nowadays, because of its proximity to Gorgan, Ziarat is growing and the village is undergoing rapid modernization, which {{in the near future}} could lead to <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> all its rural and cultural characteristics, including its dialect. The dialect spoken by the Galesh in Ziarat, which can be described as a variant of Mazandarani, is under heavy influence from Persian. Persian influence can be observed at all levels of morphosyntax {{as well as in the}} vocabulary. However, Ziarati still retains its Mazandarani identity, which can be observed particularly in the verb system. <b>The</b> contents <b>of</b> this monograph are five texts in phonemic transcription with English and Persian translations and a grammatical sketch. The three appendices consist of one text in phonetic transcription, a glossary, and notes on the photos and film found on the CD accompanying the book. <b>The</b> sound files <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five texts are also included on the CD. We hope that <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> Ziarat will take pride in this product, which aims to give an authentic picture of life in an Iranian village at the present time, thereby acknowledging their language and culture and spreading knowledge about it both in Iran and within the international linguistic community. ...|$|R
