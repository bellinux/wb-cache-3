40|$|Igf 2 and H 19 are coordinately {{regulated}} imprinted genes physically linked on {{the distal}} end of mouse chromosome 7.

To test the sufficiency of the DMR for the third function, we inserted DMR at two heterologous positions in the genome, downstream of H 19 and at the alpha-fetoprotein locus on chromosome 5.

40|$|This article draws a {{parallel}} between {{higher education in}} the United States and Brazil placing emphasis on its different origins. The college tradition in the United States began with Harvard in the seventeenth century soon after the pioneers settled in the new land. These institutions were private, closer to their Board of Trustees than to the British Crown, and had a deeply religious character. Since one of their objectives was to train religious leaders, character formation was very valued. Located far from city centers, colleges used to operate as almost a total institution. The first Brazilian higher education institutions were created {{in the early nineteenth century}} when the Portuguese Royal family left Lisbon for its colony, Brazil. Schools of Medicine, Law, Pharmacy, etc. were called Faculdades. Highly elitist they were located in large cities. They followed the model of Napoleonic Great French Schools, which were secular institutions aimed at training professionals. United States and Brazil have quite different higher education systems, but both still sustain, to a large extent, their respective <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and pay tribute to them...|$|R

MethodsDissection of the anterolateral {{aspect of the}} knee was performed in six cadavers. After isolation of the ALL, its lenght, width and thickness were measured as its places <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and insertion. The ALL origin was documented {{in relation to the}} lateral collateral ligament (LCL) origin and the insertion was documented in relation to the Gerdy tubercle, fibullar head and lateral meniscus. After the first two dissections, the ligament was removed and sent to histologycal analysis. ResultsThe ALL was clearly identified in all knees. Its origin in the lateral epycondile was on average 0. 5 mm distal and 2. 5 mm anterior to the LCL. In the tibia, two insertions were observed, one in the lateral meniscus and another in the proximal tibia, about 4. 5 mm distal to the articular cartilage, between the Gerdy tubercle and the fibullar head. The average measures obtained were: 35. 1 mm lenght, 6. 8 mm width and 2. 6 mm thickness. In the ligament histological analysis, dense connective tissue was observed. ConclusionThe ALL is a constant structure in the knee anterolateral region. Its origin is anterior and distal to the LCL origin. In the tibia, it has two insertions, one in the lateral meniscus and another in the proximal tibia between the Gerdy tubercle and the fibullar head...|$|R

30|$|In case (1), the {{opinions}} of academics on the statement <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are very different and can be summarised as follows: both countries should be <b>marked</b> “countries <b>of</b> origin”; the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> should be labelled according to the ad valorem rule; nothing “should be marked” but let the market figure out which is preferred by consumers; a standard “one rule fits all” approach cannot be applied, and the actual “impact” varies. The experts from government departments and consumer associations have similar opinions: they prefer to label both countries as countries <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> However, for applying trade measures, the originating status can be conferred only to one country and could be determined according to the ad valorem rule, while both countries could be <b>marked</b> as countries <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for ingredients.|$|R
