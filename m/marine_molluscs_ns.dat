40|$|Background Tropical <b>marine</b> <b>molluscs</b> are traded globally. Larger {{species with}} slow life {{histories}} are under threat from over-exploitation. We {{report on the}} trade in protected <b>marine</b> <b>mollusc</b> shells in and from Java and Bali, Indonesia. Since 1987 twelve species of <b>marine</b> <b>molluscs</b> are protected under Indonesian law to shield them from overexploitation. Despite this pro-tection they are traded openly in large volumes. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected data on species composition, origins, volumes and prices at two large open markets (2013), collected data from wholesale traders (2013), and compiled seizure data by the Indonesian authorities (2008 – 2013). All twelve protected species were observed in trade. Smaller species were traded for <USD 1. 00 whereas prices of larger species were USD 15. 00 – 40. 00 with clear price-size relationships. Some shells were collected locally in Java and Bali, but the trade involves networks stretching hundreds of kilometres throughout Indonesia.
