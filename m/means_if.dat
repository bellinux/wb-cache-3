5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other <b>means).</b> <b>If</b> the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other <b>means.</b> <b>If</b> the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E

25|$|Nkrumah {{spent his}} time on {{political}} organising. He and Padmore were among the principal organizers, and co-treasurers, of the Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester (15–19 October 1945). The Congress elaborated a strategy for supplanting colonialism with African socialism. They agreed to pursue a federal United States of Africa, with interlocking regional organizations, governing through separate states of limited sovereignty. They planned to pursue a new African culture without tribalism, democratic within a socialist or communist system, synthesizing traditional aspects with modern thinking, and {{for this to be}} achieved by nonviolent <b>means</b> <b>if</b> possible. Among those who attended the congress was the venerable W. E. B.

25|$|Early {{scientific}} names mostly used Latin or Greek descriptors, {{for example the}} type species Maratus amabilis (1878) refers to the friendly or pleasant Maratus. Maratus volans (1874) means the flying Maratus, reflecting the mistaken belief this species (and indeed the genus) could fly by <b>means</b> <b>if</b> its extended abdominal flap. We now know they cannot fly and the flap is used in courtship or (in at least one case) ritualised combat. Maratus chrysomelas refers to the golden yellow iridescence of the abdomen when viewed at some angles. In 1947 Dunn used the species name pavonis meaning peacock. Zabka and Waldock continued the tradition of using Latin and Greek in the 1980s and 1990s as did Otto & Hill from 2011 on, also using a patronym for Stuart Harris {{in the case of}} Maratus harrisi. As Peacock Spiders became more popular, so did patronyms, with Maratus purcellae for its discoverer Otto & Hill 2013 and Maratus proszynski for Jerzy Prószyński Waldock 2015. Common names featured in news media gained traction, particularly with Sparklemuffin for Maratus jactatus. In July 2016, Barbara Baehr and Robert Whyte from the Queensland Museum announced a newly discovered species to be named Maratus licunxin or Maratus licunxini after the artistic director of the Queensland Ballet, Li Cunxin and honoured Jürgen Otto with Maratus ottoi, Michel Duncan and Michael Doe with Maratus michaelorum, and Julianne Waldock with Maratus julianneae.|$|E
500|$|A meter not {{displayed}} on screen is what many skilled players {{refer to as}} a [...] "dizzy threshold". This <b>means</b> <b>if</b> a player manages to land a given number of consecutive punches it will put the opponent into a brief [...] "dizzy" [...] or [...] "stunned" [...] animation. A [...] "dizzied" [...] or [...] "stunned" [...] opponent will appear very discombobulated {{for a short period}} of time (in which the match timer freezes temporarily) and the player has a small margin of opporitunity to achieve an instant knockdown with a well-timed knockout punch. Each of the 16 opponents varies in how much match time it takes to become [...] "dizzied", some more quickly than others and vice-versa. There are 2 opponents who can be KOd upon the 1st knockdown, however, a knockdown during a [...] "dizzy" [...] animation is critical in making this possible. There are 8 opponents who can be KOd in 2 knockdowns, however, the player must achieve the 2nd knockdown within 4 seconds of the 1st knockdown. Finally there are 6 opponents who the player must defeat via a TKO as the aforementioned 4 seconds between the 1st 2 knockdowns does not apply.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{even the}} minds of reformers like Gogel had become {{receptive}} {{to the need for}} change. The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by [...] "Bonapartist" [...] <b>means,</b> <b>if</b> necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, {{in the hands of the}} old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a [...] "National College" [...] (akin to the French Senate) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.|$|E

500|$|On IJsselmonde the German forces {{prepared}} {{to cross the}} Maas in Rotterdam, which was defended by about eight Dutch battalions. Crossings would be attempted in two sectors. The main attack would {{take place in the}} centre of the city, with the German 9th Panzer Division advancing over the Willemsbrug. Then SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler would cross to operate on its immediate left and east of Rotterdam a battalion of the 16th Infantry Regiment of 22. Luftlandedivision would cross on boats. These auxiliary attacks might prevent a concentration of Dutch forces, blocking the 9th Panzer Division's advance through a densely built up urban area intersected by canals. In view of these conditions and the limited means available, there was a major emphasis on air support. Already on 13 May, von Küchler, fearing that the British might reinforce the Fortress Holland, had instructed Schmidt: [...] "Resistance in Rotterdam should be broken with all <b>means,</b> <b>if</b> necessary threaten with and carry out the annihilation [...] of the city". In this he was to be supported by the highest command level as Hitler would state in Führer-Weisung Nr. 11 (Führer-Directive N°11): [...] "On the northern wing the power of the Army of Holland to resist has proven stronger than had been assumed. Political as well as military grounds demand to quickly break this resistance. (...) Furthermore the speedy conquest of the Fortress Holland is to be facilitated through a deliberate weakening of the [...] power operated by Sixth Army". Kampfgeschwader 54, using Heinkel He 111 bombers, was therefore shifted from Sixth to Eighteenth Army.|$|E
