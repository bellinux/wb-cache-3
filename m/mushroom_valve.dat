50|$|A {{poppet valve}} (also called <b>mushroom</b> <b>valve)</b> is a valve {{typically}} {{used to control}} the timing and quantity of gas or vapour flow into an engine.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern {{open-circuit}} scuba sets have {{a diving}} regulator {{consisting of a}} first-stage pressure-reducing valve connected to the diving cylinder's output valve or manifold. This regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinder, which may be up to , to a lower pressure, generally between about 9 and 11 bar above the ambient pressure. A low-pressure hose links this with the second-stage regulator, or [...] "demand valve", which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way <b>mushroom</b> <b>valve</b> in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver's mouth. Some early single hose scuba sets used full-face masks instead of a mouthpiece, such as those made by Desco [...] and Scott Aviation [...] (who continue to make breathing units of this configuration for use by firefighters).|$|E
5000|$|Attracted by the {{possibilities}} of the [...] "Silent Knight" [...] engine, Daimler's chairman had contacted Knight in Chicago and Knight settled in England near Coventry in 1907. Daimler contracted Dr. Frederick Lanchester as their consultant for the purpose and a major re-design and refinement of Knight's design took place in great secrecy. Knight's design was made a practical proposition. When unveiled in September 1908, the new engine caused a sensation. [...] "Suffice {{it to say that}} <b>mushroom</b> <b>valves,</b> springs and cams, and many small parts, are swept away bodily, that we have an almost perfectly spherical explosion chamber, and a cast-iron sleeve or tube as that portion of the combustion chamber in which the piston travels." [...] Daimler dropped poppet-valve engines altogether and kept their silent sleeve-valve engines until the mid-1930s.|$|R
25|$|Exhaust valves are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The exhaust valves should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little resistance to flow as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer <b>mushroom</b> <b>valves</b> serve the purpose adequately, though duckbill valves were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate flow regulator to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|R
2500|$|Attracted by the {{possibilities}} of the [...] "Silent Knight" [...] engine Daimler's chairman contacted Charles Yale Knight in Chicago and Knight settled in England near Coventry in 1907.

2500|$|Daimler {{had founded}} an {{experimental}} workshop {{in the garden}} shed behind his house in Cannstatt near Stuttgart in 1882. Together with his employee Maybach they developed a compact, high-speed single-cylinder engine, patented on April 3, 1885 and called [...] "grandfather clock engine." [...] It had a float metered carburetor, used <b>mushroom</b> intake <b>valves</b> which were opened by the suction of the piston's intake stroke, and instead of an electrical ignition system, it used hot tube ignition, a platinum tube running into the combustion chamber, heated by an external open flame. [...] It could also run on coal gas. It used twin flywheels and had an aluminum crankcase.|$|R
40|$|A {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} injection device with moving-coil electromagnetic linear actuator and <b>mushroom</b> type poppet <b>valve</b> was designed to supply a large-bore intake port injection type engine with sufficient fuel timely. The transient engine CFD model combined with the poppet valve's motion was established to research the effect of injection conditions on the mixing homogeneity in the intake port and cylinder. Computed penetration distances of impinging jet with different k-ε models and different wall functions are compared with measured results in the literature to validate the model. It was observed that the gas injection location and number of nozzle holes {{have a significant effect}} on mixing performance both in the intake port and cylinder...|$|R
50|$|First engines {{had large}} steam domes, open cabs and C16 style tenders. Those built from 1938 onwards, commencing with N°858, had small steam domes, sedan cabs with welded tenders and also larger {{diameter}} (9+1/2 in) piston valves. The {{two types of}} boilers were occasionally interchanged at overhauls and by later years most of the old style ones had been replaced. The last 40 engines, N°961 to N°1000, were fitted with Timken roller bearings and painted brown. They acquired the nickname of Brown Bombers after American boxer Joe Louis. Those overhauled {{in the last years}} of steam operations were repainted black. A number of modifications were carried out over their life including the fitting of large <b>mushroom</b> air snifting <b>valves.</b> Several had additional sandboxes and/or rear headlights fitted at various times for working lines where no turning facilities were available.|$|R
