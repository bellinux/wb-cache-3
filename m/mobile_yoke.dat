[...] During this time the 911th operated from Goose Air Base in Labrador, Canada. [...] That summer, the squadron supported the deployment of Nineteenth Air Force from Seymour Johnson to Clark Air Base, Philippines in Exercise <b>Mobile</b> <b>Yoke.</b> [...] In 1961 a crew from the squadron was named the top refueling crew in SAC during the annual combat competition.|$|E

In this paper, a special {{design for a}} spoke-type IPM motor is presented to enhance motor flux-weakening capability in the operation over a wide speed range. The proposed design consists of a simple and robust mechanical device that includes radially-displaceable rotor yokes, connected to the shaft by means of springs. At high speed, the centrifugal force prevails over the elastic one due to springs, causing the <b>mobile</b> <b>yokes</b> to displace radially and to establish a partial magnetic short circuit between permanent magnets. This increases permanent magnet leakage flux and consequently reduces the air-gap field. As a result, a mechanical flux weakening effect is achieved at high speed, which helps significantly reduce the demagnetizing d-axis current to be injected by the inverter, along with the related copper losses and demagnetization issues. The proposed design is investigated in the paper using an analytical model whose parameters are computed by finite-element analysis (FEA). The effectiveness of the solution being set forth is successfully proven by some testing on a laboratory prototype. Experimental results are compared to analytical predictions showing a satisfactory accordance...|$|R
