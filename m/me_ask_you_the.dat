5000|$|... "I trust she has {{not been}} too unhappy with our position, and then let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> warm and trusting appeal for want right now to promise your {{cooperation}} for the next show. This show, as you can at that time also detect the press, it will play an important artistic and financial well above the previous year. Her austere genius and artist Sue solid skills allow us commit ourselves to You very ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Eaton: [...] "Then let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if <b>the</b> prosecuting {{officers}} {{have not been}} entirely correct in repelling all insinuations that you ever had tolerated any such means for raising funds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good dervish," [...] {{answered}} the princess, [...] "I feel {{in my heart}} that I shall succeed, and it only remains for <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> way I am to go." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY (deeply {{offended}} by his violence). Why do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me?</b> <b>You</b> have <b>the</b> explanation.|$|R
5000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question...: <b>the</b> {{first time}} <b>you</b> fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: {{how do you}} think she got that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bird," [...] {{replied the}} princess, who {{was filled with}} a joy that seemed strange to herself when she thought that the bird had cost her the lives of both her brothers, [...] "bird, let me first thank you for your good will, and then let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> where <b>the</b> Golden Water is to be found." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The two gods sent <b>me,</b> maidens, to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> {{way to the}} Isle of the Gorgons, that I may slay Medusa of the snaky hair, whom {{gods and}} men detest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> whether <b>the</b> {{contemplation of}} such a {{self-sacrifice}} should draw you, should have drawn those who heard the tale nearer to, or farther from, a certain cross which stood on Calvary some 1800 years ago? May not the tale of Antigone heard from mother or from nurse have nerved ere now some martyr-maiden to dare and suffer in an even holier cause? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{that you would}} say that," [...] he remarked coolly. [...] "Still, our meeting like this induced <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> question. If I can be of any service to you in London, I hope you will not fail to let me know. Your uncle would never forgive me if I did not do everything I could {{in the way of}} looking after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Artist," [...] he cried, {{quickening}} {{his walk}} impatiently, [...] "in {{the interests of}} the Town Council, your employers, allow <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> last time when you are going to begin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ferndale {{went down}} like a stone and Captain Anthony went down with her, the finest man's soul that ever left a sailor's body. I raved like a maniac, like a devil, {{with a lot of}} fools {{crowding}} round <b>me</b> and <b>asking,</b> `Aren't <b>you</b> <b>the</b> captain?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, turning pale; [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to {{consider}} <b>the</b> importance of your life, {{not only to}} your friends, but to the public interest. 'If not to-night,' said this madman; but supposing that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your Highness's person, what, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> what would be my despair, and what the concern and disaster of a great nation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Robert answered, {{sitting down}} by his sister, and patting her hand affectionately. [...] "It {{was a clear}} case of love at first sight. He {{was in love with}} you before he ever knew your name. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about <b>you</b> <b>the</b> very first time I saw him." ...|$|R
60|$|Again let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> {{officers}} of <b>the</b> Navy, whether {{many of you}} have not repeatedly, and in more than one particular, violated this law? And here, again, as a certain illustration, I must once more cite Captain Claret as an offender, especially in the matter of profane swearing. I must also cite four of the lieutenants, some eight of the midshipmen, and nearly all the seamen.|$|R
6000|$|... "In good troth did he," [...] {{answered}} Sir Mungo, with a sneer; [...] "but {{the young}} nobleman was soon borne down--by token, {{he had something}} of a catarrh, and spoke as hoarse as a roopit raven. Poor gentleman, if he had had his full extent of voice, {{he would have been}} as well listened to, dootless, as in a cause of his ain, whilk no man kens better how to plead to purpose.--And let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> by <b>the</b> way," [...] continued Sir Mungo, [...] "whether Lord Dalgarno has ever introduced your lordship to the Prince, or the Duke of Buckingham, either of whom might soon carry through your suit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of what harm," [...] she echoed, eyeing {{him with}} a scorn that would have slain him had he any manhood left. [...] "Of what harm? Mother of Mercy, defend <b>me!</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> question? What greater harm could have come to me than to have fallen {{into the hands of}} Ramiro del' Orca and his brigands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I {{wish you}} had sown those wild oats of yours, George. If you could have seen poor little Miss Emmy's face when she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about <b>you</b> <b>the</b> other day, <b>you</b> would have pitched those billiard-balls to the deuce. Go and comfort her, you rascal. Go and write her a long letter. Do {{something}} to make her happy; a very little will." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in {{the midst}} of a legal battle with the former {{directors}} of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced H.M.S. Pinafore. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: [...] "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to <b>me.</b> I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor... and [...] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on <b>the</b> precedent <b>you</b> set." ...|$|R
60|$|But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> seriously, from <b>the</b> mode {{in which}} those distinctions are {{originally}} conferred, is it not almost necessary that, {{far from being the}} rewards of services rendered to the State, they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed? Let us even alter their source, and consider them as proceeding from the Nation itself, and deprived of that hereditary quality; even here I should proscribe them, and for the most evident reason--that a man's past services are no sufficient security for his future character; he who to-day merits the civic wreath may to-morrow deserve the Tarpeian rock. Besides, where respect is not perverted, where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct, the esteem of mankind will have a very different value, and, when a proper independence is secured, will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important, and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hullo, Hampton, {{where do}} you spring from? Everyone has missed you from your {{accustomed}} haunts. Some said you had eloped with an heiress; others that you are wanted for forgery. I met the Hawtreys last night at dinner. They both <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> after <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> young lady quite seemed to take your disappearance to heart. The more so, I think, because she had sent down a servant with a note to your lodgings, and the girl had learnt from your landlady that you had been away for a week. Of course, I could not enlighten her. Her father took <b>me</b> apart and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> quite seriously about you. He {{seemed to think that}} you had been trying to ferret out something about this confounded letter business. He told me he had talked it over with you, regarding you as almost one of the family.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If, in your close {{intimacy}} with them, it seems strange {{that they should}} never have betrayed themselves, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to consider <b>the</b> circumstances and <b>you</b> will understand <b>the</b> apparent anomaly. Remember {{that they had been}} living as husband and wife, to all intents and purposes (except that the marriage-service had not been read over them), for fifteen years before <b>you</b> came into <b>the</b> house; and bear in mind, at the same time, that no event occurred to disturb Mr. Vanstone's happiness in the present, to remind him of the past, or to warn him of the future, until the announcement of his wife's death reached him, in that letter from America which you saw placed in his hand. From that day forth--when a past which he abhorred was forced back to his memory; when a future which she had never dared to anticipate was placed within her reach--you will soon perceive, if you have not perceived already, that they both betrayed themselves, time after time; and that you r innocence of all suspicion, and their children's innocence of all suspicion, alone prevented <b>you</b> from discovering <b>the</b> truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{drill and}} working of these guns is magnificent. Nearly [...] {{everything}} in the fore-turret is worked by steam and hydraulic power, [...] so that comparatively few men are required to move the iron monsters. [...] Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to imagine <b>the</b> men at their stations. Some are inside [...] the turret, and as guns and turret move in concert the men inside move [...] with them. Those outside the turret stand at its base, and are [...] therefore below the iron deck and protected by the iron sides of the [...] ship. The insiders revolve, aim, and fire the gun; the outsiders [...] load. The first lieutenant, standing {{at the base of}} the tower, close [...] to the hole by which it is entered, so that he may be heard by both [...] out and insiders, shouts, `Close up,' in the voice of a Stentor. At [...] this some men grasp levers, others stand by wheels which let on [...] respectively hydraulic power and steam. The captain of the tower, [...] seated on an elevated position, puts his head through a man-hole in [...] the roof of the turret, which hole is covered with a bullet-proof iron [...] hood, having a narrow opening in front. He surveys the supposed [...] enemy, and his duty is to revolve the tower, take aim, and let go the [...] firing machinery, i.e. pull the trigger. The outsiders stand by the [...] locking bolt, levers, shot-racks, etcetera. Then, in the attitude of [...] ready-for-action, all become motionless attentive statues--a regular [...] tableau-vivant.|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] she continued, eyeing him {{now with}} a sudden nervousness, [...] "emboldens <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}} which I have been dying to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> last few years. I wonder whether you will answer it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will <b>you</b> allow <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> ma'am,' said <b>the</b> excited Mr. Pickwick, {{rising from}} his seat, 'who {{that young man}} is, and where he resides?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> this. <b>You</b> read <b>the</b> newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As I take <b>you</b> back,' <b>the</b> word home jarred upon him, 'let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to persuade}} {{yourself}} that you have another friend. I make no professions, and say no more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{afternoon}} the daughter was not indoors when Henchard came, {{and he said}} drily, [...] "This {{is a very good}} opportunity for <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to name <b>the</b> happy day, Susan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will <b>you</b> let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{that was}} only for the moment. I could see nothing but her face--so sad, so wistful. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Did <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> night after our walk on the drive in <b>the</b> moonlight--did <b>you</b> dream of me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Plowman the State: Now, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question, ma'am. Do {{you have}} any {{religious}} beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|R
