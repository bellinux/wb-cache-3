5|$|This {{change was}} not welcomed {{by many people}} in Germany, who saw this new flag {{as a symbol of}} humiliation {{following}} Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. <b>Many</b> <b>conservatives</b> wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (see Colour above). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Willkie {{made two}} wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's {{informal}} envoy, and as nominal {{leader of the}} Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered <b>many</b> <b>conservatives,</b> especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{rejected}} the charter, the charter still influenced party decisions.

25|$|Many {{believe that}} Shafer's {{opposition}} to Nixon cost him the federal judgeship {{he was known}} to have desired. President Nixon appointed Shafer as chairman of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, also known as the Shafer Commission. He was criticized in this role by <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> after the panel recommended the decriminalization of marijuana use.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{had tried}} to {{maintain}} a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as too conservative and <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> who viewed him as too liberal. Many were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this period {{as head of the}} Saudi {{government}} that Prince Faisal, though still not king, established his reputation as a reforming and modernizing figure. He introduced education for women and girls despite the consternation of <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> in the religious establishment. To appease the objectors he allowed the female educational curriculum to be written and overseen by members of the religious leadership, a policy which lasted long after his death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>conservatives,</b> {{especially}} in the Midwest, in 1939–41 favored isolationism and opposed American entry into World War II—and so did some liberals. (see America First Committee). Conservatives in the East and South were generally interventionist, as typified by Henry Stimson. However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941 united all Americans behind the war effort, with conservatives in Congress taking the opportunity to close down many New Deal agencies, such as the bête noire WPA.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{and closely}} related, {{was the issue}} of whether the roughly four million freedmen should be allowed to vote. The issue was how to receive the four million Freedmen as citizens. If they were to be fully counted as citizens, some sort of {{representation}} for apportionment of seats in Congress had to be determined. Before the war, the population of slaves had been counted as three-fifths of a corresponding number of free whites. By having four million freedmen counted as full citizens, the South would gain additional seats in Congress. If blacks were denied the vote and the right to hold office, then only whites would represent them. <b>Many</b> <b>conservatives,</b> including most white southerners, northern Democrats, and some northern Republicans, opposed black voting. Some northern states that had referenda on the subject limited the ability of their own small populations of blacks to vote.|$|E

25|$|During the campaign, Nixon {{also used}} as a theme his {{opposition}} to the decisions of Chief Justice Earl Warren. <b>Many</b> <b>conservatives</b> were critical of Chief Justice Warren for using the Supreme Court to promote liberal policies in the fields of civil rights, civil liberties, and {{the separation of church and}} state. Nixon promised that if he were elected president, he would appoint justices who would take a less-active role in creating social policy. In another campaign promise, he pledged to end the draft. During the 1960s, Nixon had been impressed by a paper he had read by Professor Martin Anderson of Columbia University. Anderson had argued in the paper for an end to the draft and the creation of an all-volunteer army. Nixon also saw ending the draft as an effective way to undermine the anti-Vietnam war movement, since he believed affluent college-age youths would stop protesting the war once their own possibility of having to fight in it was gone.|$|E
25|$|The PCA has {{its roots}} in {{theological}} controversies over liberalism in Christianity and neo-orthodoxy that had been a point of contention in the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. (formerly the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America) which had split from the mainline Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A along regional lines {{at the beginning of the}} Civil War. While the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy had led to a split in the PC-USA in the mid 1930s, leading to the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Bible Presbyterian Church, the PCUS remained intact. However, beginning in 1942, as the PCUS began to experiment with confessional revision, and later, when neo-orthodoxy and liberalism began to become influential in the PCUS' seminaries, and attempts were made to merge with the more liberal PC-USA and its successor, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., renewal groups began to be formed, including the Presbyterian Churchmen United, which had been formed by more than 500 ministers and ran 3/4 page statements of their beliefs in 30 newspapers, the Presbyterian Evangelistic Fellowship, conducted revivals in PCUS churches, the Concerned Presbyterians, and the Presbyterian Churchmen United (PCU), an organization of conservative pastors in the Southern Presbyterian Church. They sought to reaffirm the Westminster Confession of Faith as the fullest and clearest exposition of biblical faith, which <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> felt that presbyteries had been violating by receiving ministers who refused to affirm the virgin birth and bodily resurrection, and to expect all pastors and leaders to affirm the inerrancy of scripture. Opponents of the merger took specific issue with the United Presbyterian Church's adherence to the Auburn Affirmation and the Confession of 1967; the Southern Presbyterian denomination rejected the adoption of these confessions as official standards, noting amorphous biblical doctrine, lax sexual ethic, and conversations with other church bodies that rejected the Reformed faith, such as those explored by the Consultation on Church Union. They also felt the church should disavow the ordination of women.|$|E

500|$|Accommodationists, in contrast, argue {{along with}} Justice William O. Douglas that [...] "e are a {{religious}} people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being".

Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent, Keynes made clear his loathing of Nazism. As a lifelong pacifist he had initially favoured peaceful containment of Nazi Germany, yet he began to advocate a forceful resolution while <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> were still arguing for appeasement.

500|$|Further {{controversy}} would erupt {{over the}} state of the church's missionary efforts. Sensing a loss of interest and support for foreign missions, the nondenominational Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry published Re–Thinking Missions in 1932, which promoted universalism and rejected the uniqueness of Christianity. Because the Inquiry had been initially supported by the PCUSA, <b>many</b> <b>conservatives</b> were concerned that Re–Thinking Missions represented the views of PCUSA's Board of Foreign Missions. Even after board members affirmed their belief in [...] "Jesus Christ as the only Lord and Saviour", some conservatives remained skeptical, and such fears were reinforced by modernist missionaries, including celebrated author Pearl S. Buck. While initially evangelical, Buck's religious views developed over time to deny the divinity of Christ.|$|E
