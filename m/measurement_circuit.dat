Key features to achieve this are a Clock Frequency Accuracy <b>Measurement</b> <b>Circuit</b> for detecting rises and fall in the clock frequency; a Data Operation Circuit to assists RAM failure testing; an ADC self-diagnostic function for preventing system malfunction; and an open-circuit detection function to detect open circuits in connections to temperature, pressure, current, and other sensors.|$|E
50|$|According to the Gibbs-Stockholm {{convention}} (2), {{the sign}} of the electrode potential is determined by the polarity of the cell terminal measured against the standard hydrogen electrode using an instrument for DC-potential measurements, when this circuit is closed and balanced (i.e., the current on the <b>measurement</b> <b>circuit</b> is nil). In convention (2), the value of the measured EMF is invariant of the direction of the infinitesimally small changes of the electric current that may be allowed on the measured electrode and render it either cathodic or anodic. Therefore, the value of E does not change with the direction of the (very small) current, even though ΔG of the corresponding reaction is bivariant (can be of either positive or negative sign).|$|E
50|$|The current {{itself is}} applied using current sources, either a single current source {{switched}} between electrodes using a multiplexer or {{a system of}} voltage-to-current converters, one for each electrode, each controlled by a digital to analog converter. The measurements again may be taken either by a single voltage <b>measurement</b> <b>circuit</b> multiplexed over the electrodes or a separate circuit for each electrode. Earlier EIT systems still used an analog demodulation circuit to convert the alternating voltage to a direct current level before running it through an analog to digital converter. Newer systems convert the alternating signal directly before performing digital demodulation. Depending on indication, some EIT systems are capable of working at multiple frequencies and measuring both magnitude and phase of the voltage. Voltages measured are passed on to a computer to perform image reconstruction and display. The choice of current (or voltage) patterns affects the signal-to-noise ratio significantly. With devices capable of feeding currents from all electrodes simultaneously (such as ACT3) {{it is possible to}} adaptively determine optimal current patterns.|$|E

50|$|The burden in a CT {{metering}} circuit is the largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 can tolerate an impedance {{of up to}} 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit before its accuracy falls outside of its specification. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT's rated burden. Items {{that contribute to the}} burden of a current <b>measurement</b> <b>circuit</b> are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.|$|E
5000|$|Wien's {{scientific}} research {{were in the}} areas of high frequency electronics, acoustics, and electrolyte conductance. [...] He is known for the invention of the Wien bridge in 1891, a type of AC <b>measurement</b> <b>circuit</b> similar to the Wheatstone bridge which was used to measure the impedance of capacitors and inductors. [...] From 1906 to 1909 he did research into the efficiency of early radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, which used an electric spark to generate radio waves. In existing transmitters the spark damped the oscillation in the tuned circuit, creating highly damped waves, in which the radio energy was spread over a wide bandwidth, limiting their range. In 1906 Wein invented a new type of spark gap, called a [...] "quenched gap", that extinguished the spark immediately after energy had been transferred to the tuned circuit. [...] This transmitter produced very lightly damped waves, which had a narrower bandwidth and thus greater range, and also produced an easy to identify musical tone in the receiver headphones. Wein [...] "singing spark" [...] or quenched-spark transmitters ("Löschfunkensender") were widely used {{until the end of the}} spark era around 1920. At Jena he studied the conductance of electrolyte solutions when high fields and high frequencies, discovering what is now called Wien's law.|$|E

25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings.
