40|$|Background/PurposePollen allergy is {{believed}} to be less common in East Asia, Latin America, and tropical areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of pollen allergy in Taiwan. MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis were enrolled. All subjects received a 30 -item skin test panel that included perennial allergens (house dust mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, dog epithelium, cat hairs, cockroach mix, and Candida albicans) and pollen allergens (acacia, pine mix, eucalyptus, beefwood, juniper <b>mix,</b> <b>willow,</b> mulberry <b>mix,</b> pepper tree, cedar, Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, ragweed mix, Timothy grass, spiny pigweed, cocklebur, sage mix, sheep sorrel, dog fennel, pigweed mix, English plantain, castor bean, alfalfa, and dandelion). ResultsA total of 419 patients were recruited. A total of 313 (74. 7 %) had a positive skin test. A total of 288 patients (68. 7 %) were sensitive to perennial allergens, and 11 8 patients (28. 2 %) were sensitive to pollen allergens. However, 93 pollen-sensitive patients were also sensitive to perennial allergens, and only 25 were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. The most common allergens were D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust mix, and cockroach, but the most common pollen allergens were spiny pigweed, Johnson grass, and sheep sorrel. All nasal symptoms tended to be more severe in patients who were sensitive to perennial allergens than in those who were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. ConclusionMost patients with allergic rhinitis in Taiwan are sensitive to perennial allergens, and pollens are a less common allergen...|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} a very wide range, {{occurring}} naturally from North Africa, across the Middle East and Central Asia to western China. It {{may be found in}} dry temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and subtropical dry broadleaf forests at altitudes of up to 4000 m above sea level. It is a prominent component of tugay floodplain ecosystems along river valleys in arid and semi-arid regions, <b>mixed</b> with <b>willow,</b> tamarisk and mulberry in dense thickets. It grows well on land that is seasonally flooded and is tolerant of saline and brackish water. Much used as a source of firewood, its forests have largely disappeared or become fragmented over much of its natural range.|$|R
40|$|PosterShort Rotation willow Coppice (SRC) is an {{important}} source of biomass energy in Ireland. Growing and intensively managing trees at wide spacing generates high value timber, sequesters carbon and delivers other ecosystem services. The alley coppice system combines the production of SRC with high value timber trees. Three alley coppice experiments were established to study the interaction of SRC with high value timber trees. In Experiment 1 the cherry variety - willow interaction is investigated: 5 willow varieties (and a mixture of all 5); (‘Resolution’, ‘Beagle’, ‘Endeavour’, ‘Olaf’ and ‘Terra Nova’) interact with rows of clonal wild cherry: ‘Neso’, ‘Pluto’, ‘Saturn’, ‘Hermes’ and ‘Concordia’ and one control of seedlings. The willow is planted in double rows 0. 75 m by 1. 5 m apart. Cherry trees are planted at an intra-row tree to tree spacing of 2. 5 m and inter-row spacing of 12. 75 m and alley widths of 1 m & 2 m. In Experiment 2, 18 year old poplars (‘Hoogwoorst’, ‘Beaupre’, ‘Gebec’ ‘Trichobel’) are 5 m apart in 14 m wide alleys, planted with each of the 7 willow varieties (6 monoculture – as above in Experiment 1 but including ‘Tora’ & one <b>mixed</b> <b>willow</b> treatment simulating commercial planting). In Experiment 3, cherry are inter-planted along an existing commercial SRC as single tree plots in a linear randomised design. Cherry trees are 2. 5 m apart in rows; each is 2. 5 m from nearest willow stool. Each block contains 5 sub plots. Each sub plot contains 26 tree genotypes: 22 German varieties, 2 French varieties and seedlings as controls. For each experiment the growth and yield of the tree and SRC components and their interactions will be measured and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Goričko Landscape Park is a well-preserved {{example of}} typical Central-Europeanagricultural landscape. We used {{modified}} PHYSIS typology {{to describe and}} classify different habitat types (HT), especially the riparian stream corridors and patches (RSCP) -habitats of riparian woody stands occurring outside the closed woodland. The RSCP of Goričko were categorized into 107 HT, which cover 1. 35 % of the 45, 000 ha in Goričko. The ash-alder vegetation is the most widespread riparian HT. For the detailed analysis, we compared two similar areas that differ only in land-use intensity. RSCP showed slightly higher fractal dimension and significantly higher elongation index in more intensified area B. The analysis of RSCP types on these areas showed a shift, accompanying increased agricultural impact, from pure stands to mixed, from trees to scrub, from ash-alder and white <b>willow</b> stands to <b>mixed</b> riverine <b>willow</b> stands. The course of the intensification produced two results: arable HT were united into large, homogeneous polygons, while less usable land was abandoned. We can conclude {{that some of the}} landscape characteristics we used can be applied to detect the level of preserved traditional cultural landscape...|$|R
50|$|The Achomawi {{follow in}} the {{tradition}} of other California tribes, with their skills in basketry. Baskets are made of willow and are colored with vegetable dyes. Their basketry is twined, and compared to the work of the Hupa and Yurok are described as being softer, larger, and with designs that lack the focus on one horizontal band. The shapes are similar to those made by the Modoc and have slightly rounded bottoms and sides, wide openings and shallow depth. Baskets sizes and shapes depend on the intended use. Some baskets are created for women to wear as caps, some for cooking on hot stones, holding semi-liquid food or water. Willow rods are used for the warp and pine root is used for the weft. In the caps, only tule fiber is used. A burden basket was also made by the Achomawi, as was a mesh beater which would be used to harvest seeds into the burden baskets, made of <b>willow</b> or a <b>mix</b> of <b>willow</b> and pine root.|$|R
50|$|A. viridis is a light-demanding, fast-growing shrub {{that grows}} well on poorer soils. In many areas, it {{is a highly}} {{characteristic}} colonist of avalanche chutes in mountains, where potentially competing larger trees are killed by regular avalanche damage. A. viridis survives the avalanches through its ability to re-grow from the roots and broken stumps. Unlike some other alders, it does require moist soil, and is a colonist of screes and shallow stony slopes. It also commonly grows on subarctic river gravels, particularly in northern Siberia, Alaska and Canada, occupying areas similarly disrupted by ice floes during spring river ice breakup; in this habitat it commonly occurs <b>mixed</b> with shrubby <b>willows.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Buzzby and {{his party}} were the first ready and off to cut moss. They drew a sledge after them towards the Red-snow Valley, which was not more than two miles distant from the ship. This [...] "mossing", as it was termed, {{was by no means}} a {{pleasant}} duty. Before the winter became severe the moss could be cut out from the beds of the snow streams with comparative ease, but now the <b>mixed</b> turf of <b>willows,</b> heaths, grasses, and moss was frozen solid, and had to be quarried with crowbars and carried to the ship like so much stone. However, it was prosecuted vigorously, and a sufficient quantity was soon procured to pack on the decks of the ship, and around its sides, so as to keep out the cold. At the same time the operation of discharging the stores was carried on briskly, and Fred, in company with Meetuck, O'Riley, and Joseph West, started with the dog-sledge on a hunting expedition.|$|R
40|$|Beavers were re-introduced in the Biesbosch, The Netherlands, a wood {{dominated}} by willows Salix spp. Conservationists expected that herbivory by beavers would enhance succession to a <b>mixed</b> broad-leaved forest. <b>Willows</b> formed the staple food of the beavers, but they removed only 1. 4 % of the standing crop. rn the future, this might increase to 5 %, which is roughly {{one-third of the}} regrowth of these willows. Non-willow species such as Alnus, Corylus, Fraxinus, Populus and Prunus were very uncommon in the Biesbosch, but they were positively selected by beavers away fr om the den and - in one year - away from the water. Beavers were possibly selecting complementary nutrients, choosing Corylus and Fraxinus for Na, and Prunus and Populus for p. Alternatively, {{they may have been}} eating a mixed diet as a strategy to avoid dietary deficiencies of whatever type. We conclude that the beavers will not enhance the succession to a more mixed forest, because they selectively remove non-willow tree species. In any case, we doubt whether such a succession would take place without restoration of a more natural water regime...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly difficult to provide on-site mitigation for wetland impacts due to road construction in northeastern Minnesota counties that retain greater than 80 percent of their pre-settlement wetlands. Abandoned gravel pits {{are one of the}} few remaining areas that can serve as wetland mitigation sites within the impacted watersheds. The overall goal of the project is to develop cost effective methods for creating functional mitigation wetlands on abandoned gravel pit sites to compensate for wetland impacts due to road construction in northeastern Minnesota. More specifically, the aim is to achieve ―in-kind ‖ compensation by creating wetlands of the same type and function as those being disturbed, such as fresh meadow and shrub swamp. A 1. 3 hectare wetland demonstration site was established in an abandoned gravel/borrow pit within the U. S. Trunk Highway 53 reconstruction corridor in July 2007 to evaluate techniques for creating fresh meadow and shrub swamp wetlands. Aggregate material was removed from the site to a level below the water table and the resulting basin was filled with organic soil displaced by the road construction. Construction activities were monitored for subsequent cost analysis. A total of 50 – 5 m x 5 m plots were established to determine the effect of donor wetland soil applications, wetland temporary and native sedge/wet meadow seed <b>mixes,</b> and native <b>willow</b> hardwood cuttings on wetland establishment. Additional plots were established to determine growth and survival of hardwood cuttings of five native willow species. Plant species and percent cover, and willow survival and height were recorded for each plot in June an...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the suitability of the ECOSSE model to estimate soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) from arable land and short rotation coppices of poplar and willow. Between 2011 and 2013, we measured Rh with automatic closed dynamic chambers on root exclusion plots at one site in the UK (<b>willow,</b> <b>mixed</b> commercial genotypes of Salix spp.) and two sites in Italy (arable and poplar, Populus × Canadensis Moench, Oudemberg genotype), and compared these measured fluxes to simulated values of Rh with the ECOSSE model. Correlation coefficients (r) between modelled and measured monthly Rh data were strong and significant, with a range between 0. 81 and 0. 96 for all three types of vegetation. There was no significant error and bias in the model for any site. The model was able to predict seasonal trends in Rh at all three sites even though it occasionally underestimated the flux values during warm weather in spring and summer. Because of the strong correlation between the measured and modelled values, {{it is unlikely that}} underestimation of the flux is the result of missing processes in the model. Therefore, further detailed monitoring of Rh is needed to modify the model. In this research, a limited set of input data was used to simulate Rh at the three sites. Nevertheless, overall results of the model evaluation suggest that the ECOSSE model simulates soil Rh adequately under all land uses tested and that continuous and direct measurements (such as automatic chambers installed on root-exclusion plots) are a useful tool to test model performance to simulate Rh at the site level. Highlights: Model evaluation is crucial to predict soil carbon balance accurately. Modelled and measured heterotrophic respiration were compared for three land uses. The model performed well statistically for all three vegetation types. Modelled heterotrophic respiration should be evaluated by comparison to continuous measurement...|$|R
