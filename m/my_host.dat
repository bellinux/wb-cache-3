500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{anger and}} {{frustration}} over the secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity. In the first letter she proudly announces [...] "at supper <b>my</b> <b>host</b> told me bluntly that I was a woman of observation, for I asked him men's questions" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).|$|E
2500|$|The London Courier {{reported}} Red Shirt and companions {{were treated}} to an evening of English hospitality. “Willesden was as it were taken by storm on Sunday last, being invaded by the Indian contingent of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. The fact was that Mr. T.B. Jones, of the White Hart Hotel had, as another instance of his great geniality, invited Red Shirt, Blue Horse, Little Bull, Little Chief and Flies Above and about twenty others to an outing to his well-known hostelry, whereabout they might enjoy his bounteous hospitality. In carriage and brake, provided by <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> these celebrated chiefs, along with their swarthy companions, with faces painted gaily, bedizened and bedangled with feathers and ornaments, and clad in their picturesque garments, accompanied by their chief interpreter, Broncho Bill and other officials, reached the White Heart about half-past 12 o’clock.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>host</b> now {{appeared}} to be almost beside himself with excitement.|$|E
60|$|After {{this last}} {{specimen}} of <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> taste in curiosities, I pursued my investigation no further. I {{returned to my}} chair, {{and waited for the}} truffles.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> {{observations}} were {{cut short by}} another series of yells, of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us. This time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching.|$|R
60|$|Two {{good results}} {{followed}} the ready {{rendering of the}} help I had asked from <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> daughters. I succeeded with my portrait of Mademoiselle Clairfait, and I heard the story which occupies the following pages.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>host</b> had rejoined me. His face, however, {{looked a}} little troubled.|$|E
60|$|The {{interval}} expired; {{the door}} was thrown open; the voice of <b>my</b> <b>host</b> summoned me again to the inner room.|$|E
60|$|What has {{happened}} is this: <b>My</b> <b>host</b> has met me in the doorway, and shaken me heartily by the hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Major, {{for your}} kind {{reception}} and your pretty compliment," [...] I said, matching <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> easy tone {{as closely as}} the necessary restraints on my side would permit. [...] "You have made your confession. May I make mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, true," [...] exclaimed Nigel, laughing. [...] "This is Moses, father, <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> servant, and <b>my</b> {{very good}} friend, and a remarkably free-and-easy friend, as you see. He will guide {{us back to}} the cave, since Van der Kemp seems to have left us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] said he. [...] "The General who is {{to command}} my armies must promise to carry out my orders. If he fails he will share the fate of poor Crinkle. Now, then, who will {{volunteer}} to lead <b>my</b> <b>hosts</b> to the Emerald City?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--why, I've just {{grasped the}} fact that your father--your father, mind you--is <b>my</b> <b>host.</b> I'm the honored guest. At his house!" ...|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. Crack-in-my-eye-Tommy, spy on <b>my</b> <b>host!</b> And such a {{harmless}} little chap, too. Excuse me, Alice. Besides I have an engagement.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{could be}} more {{agreeable}} than to see the striving of two such good friends as Angut <b>my</b> <b>host</b> and Ujarak the angekok?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>host's</b> words {{encouraged}} me. It {{was true}} {{he had said}} very little, but that was always Haldane's way; and, seeing that he now desired to change the subject, I followed his lead. [...] "I hope your health is not failing you again, sir?" [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously I {{opened the}} door of my {{apartment}} and, followed by Woola, sought the inner of the great doors. A wild scheme had come to me; I would attempt to force the great locks by the nine thought waves I had read in <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> mind.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh yes. Traddles {{is a good}} fellow,' {{returned}} <b>my</b> <b>host</b> nodding {{his head}} {{with an air of}} toleration. 'Traddles is quite a good fellow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may have}} come here to wash his wounds--salt is a styptic," [...] said <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> who had {{recovered}} his correct precision of statement.|$|E
6000|$|... "’A last toast {{before we}} retire,’ said <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> {{pitching}} {{the end of}} his cigar into the fire and turning to the small table.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} his terrifying appearance, {{it was clear that}} the man was not a ruffian. He spoke with deference, and his voice betrayed {{consideration}} for the girl; and again a sense of compassion came upon me. Still, there was <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> daughter to consider, and I turned towards her.|$|R
60|$|Darkness fell, but no caravan appeared: it {{had been}} delayed by a runaway mule,--perhaps {{by the desire to}} {{restrain}} my vagrant propensities,--and did not arrive till midnight. <b>My</b> <b>hosts</b> cleared a Gurgi for our reception, brought us milk, and extended their hospitality to the full limits of even savage complaisance.|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{is going}} to cost them a pretty penny," [...] {{observed}} <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> who was calmly continuing his supper; [...] "why couldn't they wait?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Is this true, <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> {{or is it}} false?’ and he clasped Procrustes round {{waist and}} elbow, {{so that he could}} not draw his sword.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, madam; {{a twinge}} in my shoulder," [...] said the lad. [...] "I speak to <b>my</b> <b>host</b> and hostess? Sure {{you have been}} very kind to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, for my part, I am a {{moderate}} man,' exclaimed Calidas the Indian, 'and would not injure even these accursed dogs of Turks. I have not cut <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> throat, but only {{turned him into}} my porter, and content myself with his harem, his baths, his fine horses, and other little trifles.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{building}} in which I found myself contained the machinery which produces that artificial atmosphere which sustains life on Mars. The {{secret of the}} entire process hinges {{on the use of}} the ninth ray, one of the beautiful scintillations which I had noted emanating from the great stone in <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> diadem.|$|R

6000|$|In the smoking-room, {{to which}} <b>my</b> <b>host</b> now led me, was a packet, {{fastened}} with many seals and enclosed {{in a single}} sheet of strong paper thus endorsed: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You won’t see it; I’m not in {{the least}} celebrated—my obscurity protects me. But couldn’t you bear even to see I was dying or dead?” <b>my</b> <b>host</b> enquired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. De la Borne," [...] he said, [...] "I have {{understood}} {{that you were}} <b>my</b> <b>host,</b> and I appeal to you. Is this person indeed your elder brother?" ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I had {{finished}} my supper, and by <b>my</b> <b>host's</b> desire had drawn {{up a chair}} by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, {{at the same time}} excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.|$|R
