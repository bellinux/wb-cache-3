The GST was created to help eliminate the ever-growing deficit and to replace the hidden <b>Manufacturer's</b> sales <b>tax,</b> which Mulroney argued was hurting business. Mulroney's usage of a rare Constitutional clause to push the tax through, prices not falling very much with the MST removed, and the [...] "in your face" [...] nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public. The succeeding Liberal government of Jean Chrétien campaigned in 1993 on a promise to eliminate the GST (as per the Red Book), but ultimately backed away from that promise. This prompted two of their members Sheila Copps and John Nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest. Mulroney's supporters argue that the GST helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit, and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable.|$|R

The Court of Appeal affirmed the portion of the judgment that awarded the manufacturer a refund of the sales tax it had paid for licensing switch-specific programs, reversed the denial of the manufacturer's claim for a refund of the sales tax it had paid for licensing prewritten programs, and remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the manufacturer with regard to the prewritten programs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{information on}} <b>manufacturers</b> sales <b>taxes</b> in four African countries — Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Ghana. Because {{there are no}} retail sales taxes in tropical Africa, a comparison is made with the retail sales taxes of two relatively small non-African countries — Barbados and Iceland. Topics discussed in this paper include {{the coverage of the}} taxes, the rates, the revenue importance, the numbers of registered firms, the administration and operation of the taxes, inspection and audit programmes and the problem of delinquency. Finally, a number of merits and criticisms of these taxes are pointed out. A number of general conclusions are suggested from the inspection of these six sales taxes. It is found that in a developing country a sales tax can be a very significant revenue source and sales taxes at the manufacturing level can function extremely well. A general problem has been the failure to develop adequate audit programmes, and also the need for simplicity in tax structure and operation has often been overlooked. There are serious dangers in placing sales tax administration under the jurisdiction of customs and excise departments because the personnel in these departments generally lack the accounting knowledge necessary to effectively administer a sales tax. Finally, it appears that the exemption of basic foods from sales tax has effectively lessened possible complaints against the taxes on equity grounds...|$|R
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% <b>Manufacturer's</b> Sales <b>Tax</b> (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To set out {{a policy}} {{analysis}} of food taxes {{as a way of}} influencing food consumption and behaviour. Design: The study draws on examples of food taxes from the developed world imposed at national and local levels. Studies were identified from a systemised search in six databases with criteria designed to identify articles of policy relevance. Results: The dominant approach identified from the literature was the imposition of food taxes on food to raise general revenue, such as Value Added Tax in the European Union. Food taxes can be applied in various ways, ranging from attempts to directly influence behaviour to those which collect taxes for identified campaigns on healthy eating throught to those applied within closed settings such as schools. There is a case for combining taxes of unhealthy foods with subsidies of healthy foods. The evidence from the literature concerning the use and impact of food taxes on food behaviour is not clear and those cases indentified are mainly retrospective descriptions of the process. Many food taxes have been withdrawn after short periods of time due to industry lobbying. Conclusions for policy: Small taxes with the clear purpose of promoting the health of key groups, e. g. children, are more likely to receive public support. The focus of many tax initiatives is unclear; although they are generally aimed at consumers, another focus could be food <b>manufacturers,</b> using <b>taxes</b> and subsidies to encourage the production of healthier foods, which could have an effect at a population level. Further consideration needs to be given to this aspect of food taxes. Taxing food (and subsidies) can influence food behaviour within closed systems such as schools and the workplace.

40|$|In November of 2014, {{hundreds}} of advanced tax agreement (ATAs) issued by Luxembourg’s Administration des Contributions Directes (Luxembourg’s Inland Revenue, or LACD) to multinational corporate taxpayers (MNCs) were made public. Using an original dataset generated from a hand-coded sample of 172 leaked documents, the Article explores LACD administrative practices in issuing ATAs. The analysis demonstrates how a jurisdiction {{can be made}} a tax-haven by administrative practices, rather than by state law. LACD cannot be reasonably viewed – as some have suggested in LACD’s defense – a passive player in MNCs’ tax avoidance schemes. Rather, LACD is best described as a <b>manufacturer</b> of <b>tax</b> arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, even when the tax laws of the jurisdictions of residence (i. e., investors) and source (i. e., investment) are harmonized, LACD produced regulatory instruments that were intended to artificially create legal differences between the tax laws of the source and residence jurisdictions. MNCs could then exploit the manufactured tax differences to their advantage. LACD collected a fee that was functionally linked {{to the amount of}} taxes avoided by MNCs in the other jurisdictions. The findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} role of tax havens in global economy, by adding an institutional dimension to the phenomena of international tax arbitrage. Specifically, tax administrators can function as intermediaries between residence and source jurisdictions the laws of which are harmonized, and provide taxpayers with synthetic arbitrage opportunities. Hence, international coordination efforts to combat abusive tax schemes by way of advancing harmonization of tax laws may not be as effective as hoped. The Article concludes that international efforts should systematically address arbitrage manufacturing. Namely, the targets of coordinated attempts to combat international tax arbitrage should be tax administrations, and not only taxpayers...|$|R
40|$|Decisions {{about the}} {{availability}} of publicly funded new drugs, treatments and medical devices are of fundamental interest to patients, health technology <b>manufacturers,</b> clinicians and <b>tax</b> or insurance payers.

This article focuses {{on the meaning of}} representation and legitimacy in relation to such decisions within the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom. Interviews with key informants (nÂ =Â  33) indicate potentially fluid and imprecise aspects of representation and legitimacy that are not necessarily addressed by formal structures for engaging and involving stakeholders in decision-making processes. The findings suggest that those charged with managing bodies such as NICE should adopt a flexible approach to engaging and involving stakeholders. The "representation" of relevant stakeholder constituencies in decision-making procedures is not, however, enough. The legitimacy of decision-making arrangements on behalf of wider society also depends upon transparent reasoned debate that affords different interests the opportunity to challenge, test or advance arguments about evidence in a manner that discounts preconceived ideas about the status and authority of protagonists. ...|$|R

It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST. Chrétiens decision to oppose the GST in 1990 was taken for reasons of political expediency rather than for principle, namely that Chrétien needed an issue to oppose the government on that would allow him to connect with the public; sources close to Chrétien were later to claim that he had wanted to support the GST bill, but had been forced by his caucus against his will to oppose it. At a Liberal event in the fall of 1990, Chrétien stated that if he became Prime Minister [...] "the Mulroney GST will disappear", going on to say: [...] "I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it. And I will be opposed to it, always". To capitalise on widespread public dislike on the proposed GST, Chrétien ordered the Liberal-dominated Senate to defeat the GST bill in late September 1990, leading Mulroney on September 27, 1990, to appoint 8 Conservative senators to give the Tories a majority using a never before used section of the Constitution Act, the so-called [...] "Deadlock Clause". At that point, Chrétien ordered the Liberal senators to filibuster the GST bill, reducing the Senate to scenes of chaos for the entire fall of 1990. On October 24, 1990, a poll revealed that the Liberals had fallen behind the New Democrats, which Chrétien admitted in an interview might {{have something to do with}} the scenes of obstructionist, often childish behavior by the Liberal senators. Finally on December 13, 1990, the Conservative senators changed the procedure rules in the Senate to break the Liberal filibuster and passed the GST bill. Public opinion polls taken in the fall of 1990 showed between 75 and 85 percent of Canadians were opposed to the GST bill, but at the same time, most people wanted an end of the [...] "circus" [...] in the Senate as the Liberal senators filibustered using such tactics such as [...] "...hooting, catcalls, shouting, blowing kazoos, interminable reading of petitions name by name and other delaying measures". Though the often undignified behavior of the filibustering Liberal senators was not popular with the Canadian public, the GST was even more unpopular with 75% of Canadians saying in a 1991 poll that they were hostile to the new tax, which worked to Chrétien benefit. In order to reinvigorate his leadership and reorganize his office which was in chaos under the leadership of Goldenberg, he hired an old friend and classmate, Jean Pelletier, as his chief of staff in December 1990.|$|R
