40|$|Evidence {{in support}} of safety of a gene {{delivery}} procedure is essential toward gene therapy. Previous studies using the hydrodynamics-based procedure primarily focus on gene delivery efficiency or gene function analysis in mice. The current study focuses on {{an assessment of the}} safety of computer-controlled and liver-targeted hydrodynamic gene delivery in dogs as the first step toward hydrodynamic gene therapy in clinic. We demonstrate that the impacts of the hydrodynamic procedure were limited in the injected region and the influences were transient. Histological examination and the hepatic microcirculation measurement using reflectance spectrophotometry reveal that the liver-specific impact of the procedure involves a transient expansion of the liver sinusoids. No systemic damage or toxicity was observed.

Lf (200 mg/kg/day, p. o.) or vehicle (VHC) was administered for one month before and another month during TAA <b>injection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight and mortality rate were assessed {{during the month of}} TAA-intoxication.

Lf also protected rats against TAA-induced decrease in reduced glutathione and increase in malondialdehyde liver contents. Normal liver contents of hydroxyproline, nuclear factor kappa B and alpha fetoprotein; as markers of fibrosis; were increased with TAA and conserved with Lf-TAA. Lf maintained the normal architecture of the liver and immunohistochemical findings revealed increase in apoptotic bodies compared to TAA that favored necrosis.

A significant neurologic complication of pyridoxine therapy is peripheral neuropathy thought to be a result of long-term and high dose usage. Although pyridoxine-induced neuropathy is transient and can remit after its withdrawal, the process of complete recovery can be slow. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) inhibition has been shown to improve symptoms of both chemotherapy- and diabetic-induced neuropathy. This study evaluated if GCP II inhibition could behaviorally and physiologically improve pyridoxine-induced neuropathy. In the current study, high doses of pyridoxine (400 mg/kg, twice a day for seven days) were used to induce neuropathy in rats.

There was a slight stimulation of body weight gain in chickens receiving 50 μg/day cGH. In general, cGH produces a transient stimulation of body weight gain in chickens. hpGRF was also given to 4 -week-old cockerels for 14 days via daily iv injection at 0. 1, 1. 0, and 10. 0 μg/day. hpGRF at 0. 1 μg/bird daily increased body weight on day 14 (9. 1 % over the control value). The stimulating effects of hpGRF on body weight are also transient. The effects of cGH on serum somatomedin-C (SM-C) were examined. Serum SM-C concentrations were significantly elevated 24 and 36 h after injection of cGH. In conclusion, purified cGH and hpGRF appear to have some growth-promoting activity.
