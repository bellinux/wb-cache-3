40|$|Background: The {{opportunity}} {{offered by}} whole slide scanners of automated histological analysis implies an ever increasing importance of digital pathology. To {{go beyond the}} importance of conventional pathology, however, digital pathology may need a basic histological starting point {{similar to that of}} hematoxylin and eosin staining in conventional pathology. This study presents an automated fluorescence-based microscopy approach providing highly detailed morphological data from unstained <b>microsections.</b> This data may provide a basic histological starting point from which further digital analysis including staining may benefit. Methods: This study explores the inherent tissue fluorescence, also known as autofluorescence, as a mean to quantitate cardiac tissue components in histological <b>microsections.</b> Data acquisition using a commercially available whole slide scanner and an image-based quantitation algorithm are presented. Results: It is shown that the autofluorescence intensity of unstained <b>microsections</b> at two different wavelengths is a suitable starting point for automated digital analysis of myocytes, fibrous tissue, lipofuscin, and the extracellular compartment. The output of the method is absolute quantitation along with accurate outlines of above-mentioned components. The digital quantitations are verified by comparison to point grid quantitations performed on the <b>microsections</b> after Van Gieson staining. Conclusion: The presented method is amply described as a prestain multicomponent quantitation and outlining tool for histological sections of cardiac tissue.

40|$|Recently, the Mediterranean {{region has}} {{experienced}} unprecedented drought. Climate models predict {{an increase in}} drought frequency and duration. Therefore, quantifying the response of Mediterranean plants to drought is important. We contrasted wood anatomy and dendroecological features of a Mediterranean shrub, Arbutus unedo, at a xeric and a mesic site on the Italian island of Elba. Radial <b>microsections</b> of Arbutus unedo were stained, described, and crossdated. Annual ring widths of radial <b>microsections</b> were measured and compared with regional temperature and precipitation. False rings are common and distinguishable from true annual ring boundaries only by viewing radial <b>microsections</b> under high magnification. False ring formation was more common at the xeric site and was caused by below average rainfall in late summer (xeric site) and below average rainfall and high temperatures in spring and summer (mesic site). Given the predictions for increased drought, plants currently growing at mesic sites will likely adopt the growth patterns of plants currently growing at xeric sites. Thus, late summer precipitation will limit growth rates for woody plants. Arbutus unedo demonstrated its dendroecological value and future work on climate initiated shifts in Mediterranean vegetation should {{take advantage of the}} potential found in annual ring records of shrubs...|$|R

Failure analysis (FA) of MEMS is critically needed for the successful design, fabrication, performance analysis and reliability assurance of this new technology. Many devices have been examined using techniques developed for integrated circuit analysis, including optical inspection, scanning laser microscopy (SLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB) techniques, atomic force microscopy (AFM), infrared (IR) microscopy, light emission (LE) microscopy, acoustic microscopy and acoustic emission analysis.

Joints are formed {{at the moment}} of rock creation and also later in response to e. g. tectonic stress or uplift. In engineering geology the intensity of jointing is a particular measure of rock quality, as it largely defines the mechanical properties of rocks i. e. in respect to its suitability as building ground. Archean granites of the Elkon deposit, situated in the Aldan shield (South Yakutia, Russia), where chosen as the object of research. Microcracks of petrogenetic (formed due to magma cooling and crystallization) and tectonic origin have been observed in the rocks and the main goal was to analyze t he ef fect of microcracks on rock strength and deformation. Density, porosity, uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the rocks were determined according to standard approaches (Sergeev 1984). Elastic constants were determined with two methods: 1) calculated from the measured wave velocities and the bulk density (dynamic testing), and 2) unconfined compressive loading and stressstrain curve (static testing). Micro jointing has been explored by various research methods, such as: 1) macroscopic description of polished <b>microsections,</b> 2) examination of polished <b>microsections</b> with reflected light optical microscopy, 3) examination of polished <b>microsections</b> with fluorescent luminophore saturation. Acquired images of polished <b>microsections</b> were used to calculate the joint hollowness coefficient. It was calculated as a ratio between square of joints and total square of polished section. According to the joint hollowness coefficient rock samples were classified as moderately and intensely jointed. It was observed, that the higher joining rate, the lower ultimate uniaxial compressive strength. This tendency is controlled by t he presence of sliding surfaces which were formed due to tectonic movement and also microfractures in crystals. The elastic modulus also decreases with an increase of the rock jointing rate. It should be noted, that dynamic elastic modulus is higher than the static by 2. 5 – 3 times. The effect of rock jointing on the dynamic elastic modulus is explained by the abundance of open cracks – {{in the case of the}} open cracks shear-waves attenuate and primary waves slow down considerably. For the statistic elastic modulus, the loading of the sample leads to the closing of rock joint surfaces, thus increasing the inelastic (residual) strain component. Residual strain displayed inversely proportional dependence with uniaxial compressive strength. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: measure, rock quality, building ground...|$|R

40|$|Plain {{specimens}} of two batches {{of the commercial}} spring steel BS 251 A 58 of nominally identical processing but significantly differing levels of non-metallic inclusion levels, have been tested in rotating bending. The data produced has been analysed against some recent methods for the prediction of fatigue properties in high strength materials containing defects. The materials tested were specifically selected for their disparate cleanliness levels, yielding specimens with differing inclusion distribution and maxima. The morphology of critical inclusions is identical between the two material batches. Material microstructure is tempered martensite with ultimate tensile strength of approximately 2000 MPa, which renders it well above the strength level where sensitivity to defects causes variability in fatigue behaviour. Models have been selected from the literature for the prediction of fatigue limit using characterisation of the local microstructural state and the size and critical position of non-metallic inclusions. These models have been validated by the analysis of specific failures after fractographic analysis. It {{has been shown that}} these models are acceptably accurate and generally conservative. Difficulties in experimental work have precluded the planned measurement of crack growth rates during the current test work. These difficulties have yielded a superimposed mean stress to the rotating bend test. This mean stress has been quantified for each test and the result coupled with a parameter for mean stress correction. The validity of the mean stress correction has been proven in this work to be valid. More consistent results are observed for the mean stress corrected data. A statistical method for the prediction of maximum non-metallic inclusion size for a given number of specimens or components from small sample <b>microsection</b> analyses has yielded good results when compared to the fractographic observations. This work has investigated the effect of varying magnification level and number of fields surveyed on the accuracy of prediction and recommendations are made for the method for obtaining best accuracy. A 'unified' crack propagation life model from the literature has been applied which combines long and short crack growth regimes. The model has shown good correlation to the current data but only after fitting of constants and only within the low cycle regime.

40|$|Purpose. Analysis {{of changes}} of high-chromium cast irons' {{structure}} and properties {{under the influence}} of physical and heat factors during mechanical machining. Methodology. The methodology of evaluation of the cutting tool's force and heat influence on the machined material has been developed and applied. Cast specimens underwent preliminary turning to obtain the diameter of 25 mm. The <b>microsection</b> was made on the end surface of the specimen with the length of 50 mm. Standard plates with sizes 10 × 10 mm made of VK 8 according to the State Standard 19051 - 80 were used in the turning process. Findings. Force influence on the specimens made of highchromium cast iron caused strain hardening during machining. Temperature influence on the structure and properties of high-chromium cast iron during machining caused increase of the plasticity characteristics of the metallic base in the cutting area, fragmentation of the carbide phase and elimination of the strain hardening. During turning with cutting depth 0. 8 mm only force influence of the cutting tool on the specimen took place. Carbide inclusions in the surface layer didn't undergo sufficient changes; {{at the same time the}} metallic base was strain-hardened to 1 100 HV 50. As it was drawn away from the turning surface, the microhardness of the metallic base was decreasing and equaled to 500 … 520 HV 50 at the distance of 1. 2 mm from the turning surface. Strain hardening was not observed at the depth of more than 3 mm. Cutting depth increase up to 1. 5 mm caused simultaneous influence of force and heat factors. The temperature influence revealed in increasing of metallic base plasticity in the specimen's surface layers. Strain hardening of heated surface layers didn't occur. While drawing away from the cutting surface, the influence of the temperature factor decreased, when the influence of force factor remained the same. Due to the base plasticity decrease the strain hardening occurred. The metallic base strain was hardened to 490 … 520 HV 50. The overall heating of the specimen caused the decrease of strain hardening depth to 0. 4 mm. Originality.

The paper {{analyzes}} {{the importance of}} conservation re-search as exemplified by the recomposed altar of St. Rocco from St. Rocco’s Chapel in Zagreb, which caught fire in the mid- 19 th century. The research was directed in three ways: the archival-historical, the conservation investigation and by way of collaborating with the chapel users. The archival-historical research was aimed at determining {{the origin of the}} altar, with interesting records coming from various, unexpected sources. An inscription was discovered on the predella of St. Rocco’s altar, which confirmed that it was the Gradec tailors’ guild that had it made in 1755, as the altar of the Most Holy Trinity, Sts. John the Baptist and Evangelist, directing the research towards St. Mark’s Church. Visitations from {{the second half of the}} 18 th century confirmed these findings and revealed the original composition of the altar’s furnishings. The altar of the Most Holy Trinity, Sts. John the Baptist and Evangelist had been removed from St. Mark’s Church along with the rest of the Baroque furnishings during the Schmidt-Bollé renovation in 1881, after which it was probably moved to St. Rocco’s Chapel, where its titular was changed. Conservation investigations confirmed extensive alterations to the architectural structure and iconography of the altar. Sculptures from St. Rocco’s altar, together with the sculpture of St. John the Baptist from the Zagreb City Museum, attributed to the original altar, will be a subject of further research. Along with the regular procedure of taking <b>microsection</b> samples, additional testing was performed and pH values were measured. It was the specific fire injuries to the altar that proved ideal for measuring the surface pH values which could, depending on the results, facilitate the removal of the overpaint.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the consequences of the duration and the temperature of the oxidation firing on the bond strength between three non-precious alloys and a conventional dental veneering ceramic. In addition 84 test bodies were produced by every alloy and were submitted according to the demand of this investigation at firing temperatures of 500 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C in each case 5 min, 10 min and 15 min to an oxidation. One group was veneered according to manufacturer’s instructions without previous oxidation and served as a control group. Every series existed of seven metal panels which were veneered with ceramics in the same way and were submitted to the SCHWICKERATH-Test according to the DIN EN ISO 9693. Finally the break gap course was judged by one test body of every series in the longitudinal <b>microsection</b> {{with the help of a}} stereo reflected-light microscope. With the remaining six test bodies the covering degree of the metal as well as the ceramic shard with basic mass were determined in the supervision on the fractured surfaces. All test bodies clearly exceeded the demanded minimum values of 25 MPa of the DIN EN ISO 9693 and can be regarded as clinically safe. The results of the attempts showed with all alloys almost without exception that the bond strength between metal and ceramics decreases continuously with rising temperature of the oxidation. Merely the 500 °C groups, with the exception of Wirobond C, showed no significant differences to the control group. Because an additional oxidation generates costs and time-loss to the dental-technical lab and walks along without significantly better bond strengths, nevertheless, this knowledge is without clinical meaning. An unequivocal connection between the firing temperature, the bond strength and the covering degree of the metal as well as the ceramic shard with basic mass could be indicated. With rising temperature the covering degree with basic mass on the metal panels decreased, the dark colouring of the oxide on the ceramic shard increased and the shear bond strength decreased. The investigations to the effect of the duration of the oxidation showed a nonuniform picture. It took no clear influence on the bond strength. The break gap courses presented themselves continuously very consistently. They always appeared on the edge of the ceramic block, started in the opaque layer and ran out to the edge of the ceramics. A bubble formation in the bond layer between metal and ceramics was only to be found in two of three cases in the control group of Wirobond C and can be held responsible for the in general worse results of this group in comparison to the groups with oxidation. From the results of this work the conclusion of the user arises that an additional oxidation before blinding non-precious alloys with conventional dental veneering ceramic leads to no significant advantage regarding the shear bond strength...|$|E
40|$|Sexuality and the {{apparent}} segregation of sexes of Polydactylus indicus are discussed. This species is a hermaphrodite throughout its life with gonochoristic ovotestis. Visual differentiation of sexes could be misleading; only <b>microsections</b> of gonads reveal the true identity of sexes. When the ovary is active, the testis {{in the same}} individual lies dormant and rudimentary and vice versa, leading to an erroneous identification of sexes. The spawning is inshore {{with one of the}} sexes dominant and hence are the earlier reports of concentration of one sex In the oxnmercial landings. Gametes retain potency long after exposure, signifying the possibility of artificial fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{composites}} of Al 61 Cu 27 Fe 12 alloys containing quasicrystalline and crystalline phases (CQ composites) {{were obtained}} by the Bridgman method. The morphology of composites crystallized with different solidification rates was studied. The solidification rate influence on fibrous reinforcement morphology was analyzed. The <b>microsections</b> for analysis were prepared parallel and perpendicular to the direction of crystallization. The optical and the scanning electron microscope were used for metallographic observation. Obtained composites were examined by X-ray powder diffraction and reflective X-ray topography. The Laue method enabled {{to conclude that the}} matrix is single-crystalline. The different level of structural perfection of reinforcement fibres was presented at various solidification rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hermaphroditism in the small-mouthed thrcadfin fish, Polynemus microstoma Bleeker, {{collected from the}} Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar is reported for the first time. Hermaphroditism is found in both the lobes of the gonad. The two sex portions in the ovotestis, which are easily distinguishable by their colpur, adhere along {{the entire length of}} the gonad in antero-posterior direction. The testicular portion is on the inner lateral side of the gonad. The relative size of the male and female portions of the ovotestis varies in different specimens. It is seen from the <b>microsections</b> that the two sex portions are separated by a thin connective tissue...|$|R
30|$|Postmortem {{examination}} {{was conducted}} immediately after sacrifice {{to detect the}} presence of any abnormality on the animal’s vital organs. The gross appearance of these organs was observed with the naked eye, while the histological appearance of the liver, spleen, kidney and brain were observed after haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain. The animals were subjected to trans-cardiac perfusion using 4 % paraformaldehyde after anaesthesia. The tissues were later subjected to standard tissue processing and were embedded in paraffin blocks. The tissues were <b>microsectioned</b> into 5  μm thickness and mounted onto glass slides. The H&E staining technique was used to stain the slides, and they were viewed using an optical microscope (Olympus FSX- 100, Olympus Corporation, Shinjiku-ku, Tokyo, Japan).|$|R
