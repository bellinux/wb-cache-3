2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an action for conversion, the plaintiff must {{have an interest in}} the thing converted. [...] He must recover on the strength of his own title, without regard to the weakness of that of his adversary. [...] It is necessary that the plaintiff be the owner of the property claimed to be converted, or that he be in possession or entitled to possession {{at the time of the}} alleged conversion.

2500|$|The sixth {{rule of the}} {{avoidance}} doctrine provides that a court will not rule upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has benefitted from the statute. In support of this rule, Brandeis cited cases in which a party waived its ability to object to a statute because the party had pursued benefits afforded under the statute in one proceeding prior to challenging the statute's constitutionality in a separate judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court later distinguished cases relying on the [...] "estoppel to sue" [...] doctrine as being cases in which [...] "litigants had received or sought advantages from the statute that they wished to attack, advantages other than the <b>mere</b> <b>right</b> to sue." [...] The sixth rule may be of relatively little importance today. To the extent the estoppel principle {{was based on a}} doctrine forbidding parties from asserting inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) now expressly allows alternative or inconsistent allegations. Moreover, broad modern principles of claim preclusion appear to address adequately the concern reflected in the cases cited for the estoppel principle.|$|E
5000|$|The case {{stands for}} the {{proposition}} that, though a landowner has no duty to make his property safe for trespassers, he may not set deadly traps against them, holding that [...] "the law has always placed a higher value upon human safety than upon <b>mere</b> <b>rights</b> in property."

And if the value of life be regarded in a right point of view, may it not be questioned whether this right of preserving life, at any expense short of endangering the life of another, does not survive man's entering into the social state; whether this right can be surrendered or forfeited, except when it opposes the divine law, upon any supposition of a social compact, or of any convention for the protection of <b>mere</b> <b>rights</b> of property? ...|$|R
2500|$|An agent {{entrusted}} by {{a principal}} with {{the possession of}} goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. [...] Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must {{have more than a}} <b>mere</b> <b>right</b> of possession. [...] A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. [...] Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion. Causes of action for conversion are generally assignable, so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property. A transferee of personal property, or interest therein, who acquires the right of possession by or through the transfer, may maintain an action for a conversion committed after the transfer, though he has not yet received actual possession of the goods. A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property. An owner of land may bring an action in conversion, but he must be in material possession of the land and of the property severed from the land {{at the time of the}} conversion.|$|E

60|$|There {{are several}} of these {{unconscious}} American importations {{in various parts of}} Britain, some of them, no doubt, brought over with seed-corn or among the straw of packing-cases, but others unconnected in any way with human agency, and owing their presence here to natural causes. That pretty little Yankee weed, the claytonia, now common in parts of Lancashire and Oxfordshire, first made its appearance amongst us, I believe, by its seeds being accidentally included with the sawdust in which Wenham Lake ice is packed for transport. The Canadian river-weed is known first to have escaped from the botanical gardens at Cambridge, whence it spread rapidly through the congenial dykes and sluices of the fen country, and so into the entire navigable network of the Midland counties. But there are other aliens of older settlement amongst us, aliens of American origin which nevertheless arrived in Britain, in all probability, long before Columbus ever set foot on the low basking sandbank of Cat Island. Such is the jointed pond-sedge of the Hebrides, a water-weed found abundantly in the lakes and tarns of the Isle of Skye, Mull and Coll, and the west coast of Ireland, but occurring nowhere else throughout the whole expanse of Europe or Asia. How did it get there? Clearly its seeds were either washed by the waves or carried by birds, and thus deposited on the nearest European shores to America. But if Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace had been alive in pre-Columban days (which, as Euclid remarks, is absurd), he would readily have inferred, from the frequent occurrence of such unknown plants along the western verge of Britain, that a great continent lay unexplored to the westward, and would promptly have proceeded to discover and annex it.

[...] Strange argument for great and grave deliberation! As if the same end may not, and must not, be compassed, according to its circumstances, by a great diversity of ways. Thus, in Great Britain, some of our establishments are apt for the support of credit. They stand therefore upon a principle of their own, distinct from, and in some respects contrary to, the relation between prince and subject. It is a new species of contract superinduced upon the old contract of the state. The idea of power must as much as possible be banished from it; for power and credit are things adverse, incompatible; Non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur. Such establishments are our great moneyed companies. To tax them would be critical and dangerous, and contradictory to the very purpose of their institution; which is credit, and cannot therefore be taxation. But the nation, when it gave up that power, did not give up the advantage; but supposed, and with reason, that government was overpaid in credit, for what it seemed to lose in authority. In such a case to talk of the rights of sovereignty is quite idle. Other establishments supply other modes of public contribution. Our trading companies, as well as individual importers, are a fit subject of revenue by customs. Some establishments pay us by a monopoly of their consumption and their produce. This, nominally no tax, in reality comprehends all taxes. Such establishments are our colonies. To tax them would be as erroneous in policy, as rigorous in equity. Ireland supplies us by furnishing troops in war; and by bearing part of our foreign establishment in peace. She aids us at all times by the money that her absentees spend amongst us; which is no small part of the rental of that kingdom. Thus Ireland contributes her part. Some objects bear port-duties. Some are fitter for an inland excise. The mode varies, the object is the same. To strain these from their old and inveterate leanings, might impair the old benefit, and not answer the end of the new project.

He formed strong opinions on matters with which he was concerned, both professional and otherwise, and nothing would move him to swerve from what he considered to be <b>right.</b> <b>Mere</b> expediency never, I believe, influenced him. As a judge, he won the respect and admiration of the Bar, for the advancement of whose interest he was always a warm advocate, and I am sure it will be accorded to him by all that he acted judicially with the strictest impartiality.

40|$|A landholder or {{occupier}} {{is generally}} entitled to control {{access to their}} property. An unauthorised entry onto a per-son 2 ̆ 7 s property will provide the landholder with the entitlement to commence an action in trespass subject to statutory protection being available to the trespasser. Land access is {{a significant factor in}} the public debate surrounding the recovery of unconventional gas that requires access for tenure holders for various purposes. This paper first discusses the common law background to the entitlement of landholders to control access to land. The paper will then analyse the statutory regulatory structure applying in Queensland, NSW,WA and SA that entitles access to land for tenure holders in relation to unconventional gas. This paper will discuss the nature of property and perceptions of property that impact on the context in which negotiations occur between landholders and tenure holders. The paper will discuss some of the reasons the issue of access goes beyond <b>mere</b> legal <b>rights</b> {{from the perspective of the}} landholder, and how this may impact the approach taken by tenure holders and landholders in the negotiations for access to land. For the benefit of both the tenure holder and the landholder, the paper will suggest factors that may assist in promoting good negotiated outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{analyzes}} how {{the landmark}} United States Supreme Court case of Lawrence v. Texas {{has been used}} by the Fifth Circuit in Reliable Consultants, Inc. v. Earle to extend “sexual privacy interests” into the commercial realm. This Note begins by exploring the historical trend of cases that have led to the birth of sexual privacy. The Fifth Circuit in Reliable was given the task to decide whether the Texas legislature’s statutory proscription of promoting or selling devices used for sexual stimulation infringed on a <b>mere</b> commercial <b>right</b> or an individual’s right to sexual privacy. After the Fifth Circuit held in favor of the plaintiff-businesses that sold sexual devices, the defendant-state petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The majority that denied the rehearing curiously refrained from filing an opinion; however, the judges who did not agree with the Reliable majority filed dissenting opinions to the denial for rehearing. Because both the majority opinion and dissents to Reliable use Lawrence as the key case influencing their opinions, this Note critically scrutinizes the Lawrence decision in correlation to the dissenting judges’ arguments and finds that although the dissenting opinions are correct in that the majority is stretching the applicability of Lawrence too far, they are wrong in their reasoning as to why this is so...|$|R
