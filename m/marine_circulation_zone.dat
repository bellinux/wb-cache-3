40|$|Accurate {{models and}} {{realistic}} simulations are essential in developing cleaner {{and more efficient}} coal- and biomass-fired boilers. Using the CFD simulation software Fluent The University of Iowa created a model of an industrial boiler that adequately compares the practice of co-firing biomass and coal against firing only coal. The simulations used in this comparison, show significant <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> and an unrealistic temperature profile inside the boiler heat exchanger region. This model is effective for comparing the relative decrease in emissions when co-firing with biomass versus exclusively coal combustion, {{but it does not}} present a realistic simulation of biomass or coal combustion. The purpose of the current work is to develop a more realistic baseline coal combustion model. Calculations for the proximate and ultimate analysis of coal, as well as properties necessary for energy and mass flux computations, have been updated in the current model. The fuel bed model - a simple two-dimensional distribution of energy and mass fluxes from the grate - was kept the same due to the complexities of fuel bed modeling. Simulation boundary conditions and flow models were tested and modified to determine the most realistic model settings. The geometry and mesh grid of the boiler model were also varied in an attempt to fix problematic areas. Several approaches were implemented in an effort to reduce the <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> and generate a realistic temperature profile. The negative energy source term in the boiler representing the energy removed by the water pipes in the heat exchanger was analyzed, and different configurations of this sink were tested. Finally, the heat exchanger models built in to Fluent were studied and implemented. These models proved to be the most effective in reducing recirculation zones and decreasing high temperature gradients. While the current model of the coal-fired boiler has a higher overall temperature than the previous one, <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> are almost completely eliminated, the flow path has been improved, and the temperature profile in the boiler is more realistic...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{presently}} inhibiting the exploitation of geothermal energy is {{the high cost of}} drilling and completing geothermal wells. The cost of these wells typically ranges from $ 1 M to $ 3 M, which are several times that of an oil or gas well of comparable depth. These high costs are primarily driven by the harsh environment associated with geothermal reservoirs. The high temperatures which are inherent to the resource cause rapid degradation of conventional drill bits and preclude the use of conventional drilling fluids. Geothermal formations are typically hard and highly fractured. This results in low rates of penetration, high rates of drilling fluid loss, and difficulties in obtaining competent completions. The chemical composition of the downhole geothermal fluids causes extensive scaling, and combined with high temperatures, cause corrosion of drill pipe, casing, and logging equipment. Current activities include development of high temperature drilling fluids, methods for plugging lost <b>circulation</b> <b>zones,</b> advanced rock cutting techniques, and borehole instrumentation. Three specific projects which are being pursued, each at a different stage of development include: a method for locating fractures which do not intersect the wellbore, a laboratory for simulating lost <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> [...] to be used for development of new materials and techniques, and the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of PDC bits in the geothermal environment...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explain the process of knowledge acquisition utilising the method for the decomposition of the components of a system to extract design rules. The furnished drawing of a dwelling is considered as the language of a designer. These drawings contain the semantic knowledge that can be called general architectural know-how. This paper bases on the decomposition of the syntax of a room image. The syntax of a room image consists of walls, windows, <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> and furniture such as beds, wardrobes, commodes, dressing tables, etc. The syntax of a room image has some linkages. The designer put the syntax together with the joints of <b>circulation</b> <b>zones</b> as a grammar to match. The existing relations between the objects in a design can be called grammar. An experiment is applied to three classes of a CAAD course organised by the Turkish Chamber of Architects. The living room is given already furnished in the experiment and the rest of a dwelling is expected to be furnished. In the first phase, the experiment is applied on two different classes in different times. It is interesting that the same grammar is used by 6 of 8 couple of designers for 3 different types (A, B and D) of bedrooms. Only one of the bedrooms of C type) has different design styles in spite of looking much like each other. In the second phase, for the third class of 6 groups, plan is modified slightly. In this case all of the 6 couples of designers use the same grammar for 2 alternatives of D type bedroom for parents. An original method is applied in the elicitation of the knowledge in this experiment. The properties of the objects and their links are represented by a semantic network graph. This paper also presents the grammar of the furnished rooms and shows the density of preferences. Design rules are extracted from these drawings of a furnished dwelling by searching for similarities in the plans designed by different designers. The designers have some specifications about the grammar of furnishing and an image schema of the proposed room in their minds, depending on their education and experiences. During the design of a room, designers look for differences and the similarities existing in the syntax of the proposed room image and the image of furnished room on the screen.

Again high velocities were found near the inlet, the outlet, and in the outer parts of the recirculation regions.
