They had the guts to push around people, do things I couldn't— perhaps did not even want to do myself. But I'd want a friend like that (laughs). I used to adulate them like heroes.

I was always a loner - not because I was unhappy, but because I live away from myself, not just others. I like to study myself - the way I am walking, talking, behaving. My constant obsession with studying myself and other people is perhaps the primary motivation for me to be a filmmaker.|$|E
5000|$|As this {{controversy}} progressed, Lefkowitz discovered {{that students in}} Martin's class were assigned a book called The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, compiled by the Historical Research Department of the Nation of Islam. The book's thesis, is that Jews had a disproportionately large role in the black slave trade relative to their numbers. This thesis has since been condemned and refuted by mainstream historians including the American Historical Association. Lefkowitz ignited a controversy over the book's inclusion on the curriculum, and the controversy made national headlines {{in the spring of}} 1993.

They embark on a collaborative journey of empowerment and through the process reciprocally influence each other's growth and emancipation. Through an autobiographical exploration of my experiences as a student and as a teacher, I present an exploration of the concept of empowerment. I explore its significance not only on the level of literacy development in <b>my</b> kindergarten <b>classroom,</b> where I teach French in an Armenian heritage language setting, but also on a more personal and professional level. Working in the theoretical framework of teacher self-study, I present an epistemological exploration of postmodern feminist research paradigms and discuss the various aspects of autobiographical research.
