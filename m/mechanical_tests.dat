60|$|In 1890, in Proceedings of the S.P.R., Sir William Crookes {{published}} full contemporary accounts, {{noted by}} himself, of his experiments on Home in 1871, with elaborate <b>mechanical</b> <b>tests</b> as to alteration of weights; and recorded Home's feats in handling red-hot coals, and communicating {{the power of}} doing so to others, and to a fine cambric handkerchief on which a piece of red-hot charcoal lay some time.

60|$|Into {{the details}} of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tests</b> as to {{alterations}} of weights I cannot go. Mr. Angelo Lewis (Professor Hoffman), an expert in conjuring, says that, accepting Sir William's veracity, and that he was not hallucinated, the phenomena 'seem to me distinctly to be outside the range of trick, and therefore to be good evidence, so far as we can trust personal evidence at all, of Home's power of producing motion, without contact, in inanimate bodies.' Sir William himself writes (1890): 'I have discovered no flaw in the experiments, or in the reasoning I based upon them.'[27] The notes of the performances were written while they were actually in course of proceeding. Thus 'the table rose completely off the ground several times, whilst the gentlemen present took a candle, and, kneeling down, deliberately examined the position of Mr. Home's knees and feet, and saw the three feet of the table quite off the ground.' Every observer in turn satisfied himself of the facts; they could not all be hallucinated.|$|E

40|$|Situation of {{standardization}} in {{the field}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>testing</b> and measurements Dr. sc. techn. Alois Wehrstedt, DIN, Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung e. V. (Berlin) Standardized <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> methods are referred in many materials and product standards for the characterization of quality of the materials or products. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>testing</b> is carried out on materials for three different reasons:- For quality control purposes to ensure that a material conforms to a technical specification or that it has been correctly processed. - To provide information which can be used in the design of a component or structure. - As part of investigations into the reasons for failures in service. Hence the results achieved from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>testing</b> of products that are made of / or from materials are used to help guarantee the safety and reliability of materials which in turn ensures the safety of those products. The paper gives an overview on the standardization activities of the last ten years for the different fields of <b>mechanical</b> <b>testing</b> as uniaxial, ductility, hardness, toughness and fatigue testing. ...|$|R
60|$|Take, for {{simplest}} and nearest example, {{this question}} of the stress of wind. It is not the actual power that is immeasurable, if only it would stand to be measured! Instruments could easily now be invented which would register not only a blast that could lift a sailing boat, but one that would sink a ship of the line. But, lucklessly--the blast won't pose to the instrument! nor can the instrument be adjusted to the blast. In the gale of which my friend speaks in his next letter, 26th January, a gust came down the hill above Coniston village upon two old oaks, which were well rooted in the slate rock, and some fifty or sixty feet high--the one, some twenty yards below the other. The blast tore the highest out of the ground, peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orange--swept {{the head of the}} lower tree away with it in one ruin, and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over the other's stump, as one would break one's cane over some people's heads, if one got the chance. In wind action of this kind the amount of actual force used is the least part of the business;--it is the suddenness of its concentration, and the lifting and twisting strength, as of a wrestler, which make the blast fatal; none of which elements of storm-power can be recognized by <b>mechanical</b> <b>tests.</b> In my friend's next letter, however, he gives us some evidence of the consistent strength of this same gale, and of the electric conditions which attended it:--the prefatory notice of his pet bird I had meant for 'Love's Meinie,' but it will help us through the grimness of our studies here.|$|E
60|$|We now {{approach}} the second class of marvels which regaled the circle at Ragley, namely, 'Alleged movements of objects without contact, occurring {{not in the}} presence of a paid medium,' and with these we shall examine rappings and mysterious noises. The topic began to attract modern attention when table-turning was fashionable. But in common table-turning there was contact, and Faraday easily demonstrated that there was conscious or unconscious pushing and muscular exertion. In 1871 Mr. Crookes made laboratory experiments with Home, using <b>mechanical</b> <b>tests.</b> {107b} He demonstrated, to his own satisfaction, that {{in the presence of}} Home, even when he was not in physical contact with the object, the object moved: e pur si muove. He published a reply to Dr. Carpenter's criticism, and the common-sense of ordinary readers, at least, sees no flaw in Mr. Crookes's method and none in his argument. The experiments of the modern Psychical Society, with paid mediums, produced results, in Mr. Myers's opinion, 'not wholly unsatisfactory,' but far from leading to an affirmative conclusion, if by 'satisfactory' Mr. Myers means 'affirmative'. {108a} The investigations of Mrs. Sidgwick were made under the mediumship of Miss Kate Fox (Mrs. Jencken). This lady began the modern 'spiritualism' when scarcely older than Mr. Mompesson's 'two modest little girls,' and was accompanied by phenomena like those of Tedworth. But, in Mrs. Sidgwick's presence the phenomena were of the most meagre; and the reasoning faculties of the mind decline to accept them as other than perfectly normal. The society tried Mr. Eglinton, who once was 'levitated' in the presence of Mr. Kellar, the American conjurer, who has publicly described feats like those of the gentleman's butler. {108b} But, after his dealings with the society, Mr. Eglinton has left the scene. {108c} The late Mr. Davey also produced results like Mr. Eglinton's by confessed conjuring.|$|E

Material & Methods <b>Mechanical</b> <b>testing</b> of the tibia consisted of an offset 3 -pt bend test with three repetitions of loading to 350 N and return to 50 N. Tri-axial stacked strain gauges were applied to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the bone and two rigid bodies ‚Äì consisting of eight infrared active markers, were attached {{to the ends of the}} tibia. Positional measurements were taken with a FARO arm 3 D digitiser. The FE model was constructed with both geometry and material properties derived from CT images of the bone. The elasticity-density relationship used for material property determination was validated separately using <b>mechanical</b> <b>testing.</b> This model was then transformed to the same coordinate system as the in vitro <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> and loads applied.
