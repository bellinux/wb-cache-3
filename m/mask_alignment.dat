40|$|<b>Mask</b> <b>alignment</b> of {{photolithography}} {{technology is}} used in many applications, such as micro electro mechanical systems’ semiconductor process, printed circuits board, and flat panel display. As {{the dimensions of the}} product are getting smaller and smaller, the automatic <b>mask</b> <b>alignment</b> of photolithography {{is becoming more and more}} important. The traditional stacked XY-Θz stage is heavy and it has cumulative flatness errors due to its stacked assembly mechanism. The XXY stage has smaller cumulative error due to its coplanar design and it can move faster than the traditional XY-Θz stage. However, the relationship between the XXY stage’s movement and the commands of the three motors is difficult to compute, because the movements of the three motors on the same plane are coupling. Therefore, an artificial neural network is studied to establish a nonlinear mapping from the desired position and orientation of the stage to three motors’ commands. Further, this paper proposes an image-servo automatic <b>mask</b> <b>alignment</b> system, which consists of a coplanar XXY stage, dual GIGA-E CCDs with lens and a programmable automatic controller (PAC). Before preforming the compensation, a self-developed visual-servo provides the positioning information which is obtained from the image processing and pattern recognition according to the specified fiducial marks. To obtain better precision, two methods including the center of gravity method and the generalize Hough Transformation are studied to correct the shift positioning error...|$|E

40|$|Most polymer-replica-based {{microfluidic}} {{devices are}} mainly fabricated by using standard soft-lithography technology so that multi-level masters (MLMs) require multiple spin-coatings, <b>mask</b> <b>alignments,</b> exposures, developments, and bakings. In this paper, we describe a simple method for fabricating MLMs for planar microfluidic channels with multi-level barriers (MLBs). A single photomask {{is necessary for}} standard photolithography technology to create a polydimethylsiloxane grey-scale photomask (PGSP), which adjusts {{the total amount of}} UV absorption in a negative-tone photoresist via a wide range of dye concentrations. Since the PGSP in turn adjusts the degree of cross-linking of the photoresist, this method enables the fabrication of MLMs for an MLB-integrated microfluidic device. Since the PGSP-based soft-lithography technology provides a simple but powerful fabrication method for MLBs in a microfluidic device, we believe that the fabrication method can be widely used for micro total analysis systems that benefit from MLBs. We demonstrate an MLB-integrated microfluidic device that can separate microparticles. close 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Methods of <b>alignment</b> <b>masking,</b> {{which refers}} to the {{technique}} of excluding alignment blocks prior to tree reconstructions, {{have been successful in}} improving the signal-to-noise ratio in sequence alignments. However, the lack of formally well defined methods to identify randomness in sequence alignments has prevented a routine application of <b>alignment</b> <b>masking.</b> In this study, we compared the effects on tree reconstructions of the most commonly used profiling method (GBLOCKS) which uses a predefined set of rules in combination with <b>alignment</b> <b>masking,</b> with a new profiling approach (ALISCORE) based on Monte Carlo resampling within a sliding window, using different data sets and alignment methods. While the GBLOCKS approach excludes variable sections above a certain threshold which choice is left arbitrary, the ALISCORE algorithm is free of a priori rating of parameter space and therefore more objective. Results ALISCORE was successfully extended to amino acids using a proportional model and empirical substitution matrices to score randomness in multiple sequence alignments. A complex bootstrap resampling leads to an even distribution of scores of randomly similar sequences to assess randomness of the observed sequence similarity. Testing performance on real data, both masking methods, GBLOCKS and ALISCORE, helped to improve tree resolution. The sliding window approach was less sensitive to different alignments of identical data sets and performed equally well on all data sets. Concurrently, ALISCORE is capable of dealing with different substitution patterns and heterogeneous base composition. ALISCORE and the most relaxed GBLOCKS gap parameter setting performed best on all data sets. Correspondingly, Neighbor-Net analyses showed the most decrease in conflict. Conclusions <b>Alignment</b> <b>masking</b> improves signal-to-noise ratio in multiple sequence alignments prior to phylogenetic reconstruction. Given the robust performance of <b>alignment</b> profiling, <b>alignment</b> <b>masking</b> should routinely be used to improve tree reconstructions. Parametric methods of alignment profiling can be easily extended to more complex likelihood based models of sequence evolution which opens the possibility of further improvements. </p...|$|R
40|$|Inaccurate {{inference}} of positional homologies {{in multiple}} sequence alignments and systematic errors introduced by align-ment heuristics obfuscate phylogenetic inference. <b>Alignment</b> <b>masking,</b> {{the elimination of}} phylogenetically uninformative or misleading sites from an alignment before phylogenetic analysis, is a common practice in phylogenetic analysis. Although masking is often done manually, automated methods are necessary to handle the much larger data sets being prepared today. In this study, we introduce the concept of subsplits and demonstrate their use in extracting phylogenetic signal from alignments. We design a clustering approach for <b>alignment</b> <b>masking</b> where each cluster contains similar columns—similarity being defined {{on the basis of}} compatible subsplits; our approach then identifies noisy clusters and eliminates them. Trees inferred from the columns in the retained clusters are found to be topologically closer to the reference trees. We test our method on numerous standard benchmarks (both synthetic and biological data sets) and compare its performance with other methods of <b>alignment</b> <b>masking.</b> We find that our method can eliminate sites more accurately than other methods, particularly on divergent data, and can improve the topologies of the inferred trees in likelihood-based analyses.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the possibility of replacing binary diffractive optical elements and molded aspheric lenses with a continuous relief optical element known as a kinoform. With continuous relief optical elements, diffraction efficiencies of over 90 % have been reported [1, 2]. Using a grayscale master and altered properties of a normally analog resist, continuous relief optical elements can be produced with repeatable results. Typical binary structures require multiple masters to be generated. These masters approximate a continuous slope through a binary staircase profile. Alignment of these masters from layer to layer is critical and time consuming. With a gray scale master, multiple <b>mask</b> <b>alignments</b> are eliminated. As a first approximation to determine the manufacturing feasibility of such continuous relief optical elements a calibration master was procured from Canyon Materials. The following atomic force microscope (AFM) scan shows one set of blazed gratings produced from the master. Figure 1. AFM scan of 8 m blazed grating. Burleigh Instruments AFM was used.

40|$|Martialinae are pale, eyeless and {{probably}} hypogaeic predatory ants. Morphological character sets suggest {{a close relationship}} to the ant subfamily Leptanillinae. Recent analyses based on molecular sequence data suggest that Martialinae are the sister group to all extant ants. However, by comparing molecular studies and different reconstruction methods, the position of Martialinae remains ambiguous. While this sister group relationship was well supported by Bayesian partitioned analyses, Maximum Likelihood approaches could not unequivocally resolve the position of Martialinae. By re-analysing a previous published molecular data set, we show that the Maximum Likelihood approach is highly appropriate to resolve deep ant relationships, especially between Leptanillinae, Martialinae and the remaining ant subfamilies. Based on improved <b>alignments,</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>masking,</b> and tree reconstructions with {{a sufficient number of}} bootstrap replicates, our results strongly reject a placement of Martialinae at the first split within the ant tree of life.
