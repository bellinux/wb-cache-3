5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} {{occurs on}} a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, where no adatom traps or sources are present. This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy, wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses. Even {{in the case of}} a clean terrace the process <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> non-uniformity near the edges of the terrace.|$|E
5|$|The central Vishnu {{head and}} side heads of Varaha and Narasimha <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> other {{configurations}} in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the cosmic waters {{at the beginning}} of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction - the three functions in the Hindu universe. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era, where their cults were at their peak.|$|E

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> factors like ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} ocean {{acidification}} will occur <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> the rate of surface ocean warming, because the chemical equilibria that govern seawater pH are temperature-dependent.

25|$|An {{important}} role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey.

25|$|A contourite is a {{sedimentary}} deposit commonly formed on continental rise to lower slope settings, {{although they may}} occur anywhere that is below storm wave base. Countourites are produced by thermohaline-induced deepwater bottom currents and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> wind or tidal forces. The geomorphology of contourite deposits is mainly influenced by the deepwater bottom-current velocity, sediment supply, and seafloor topography.|$|E
25|$|Subjective evaluations: Traditional {{performance}} appraisals {{are often}} {{based upon a}} manager's or supervisor's perceptions of an employee's performance and employees are evaluated subjectively rather than objectively. Therefore the review <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> many non-performance factors such as employee 'likeability', personal prejudices, ease of management, and/or previous mistakes or successes. Reviews should instead be based on data-supported, measurable behaviors and results within the performers control.|$|E

25|$|Josephine McDonagh {{believes}} {{that some of}} the stylistic features of The Tenant <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> the print culture of the Brontës' time. For example, Anne’s concern to preserve the integrity of each of her narrators’ voices is similar to magazine structure that maintains the voice of individual contributors. The novel’s labyrinthine structure is established by the application of direct speech. Gilbert’s letter incorporates Helen’s diary; and in turn, Helen’s diary includes Arthur’s autobiographical reminiscences.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the amount}} of time {{adolescents}} spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors. American teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports, socializing, and caring for their appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries. These differences <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> cultural values of education and {{the amount of}} responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community.|$|E
25|$|When a {{parasitic}} female lays her egg {{in a host}} female’s nest, {{the host}} female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the egg deposition pattern deviates from the traditional one egg per day pattern. The occurrence of brood parasitism <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.|$|E

25|$|Wood posts {{enable the}} {{fabrication}} of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched {{to form a}} truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E
25|$|During hibernation, Indiana bats occupy open {{areas of}} hibernacula {{ceilings}} and generally avoid crevices and other enclosed areas. Indiana bats {{were associated with}} hibernacula that were long (µ=2,817 feet (858 m)), had high ceilings (µ=15 feet (4.5 m)), and had large entrances (µ=104.4 feet² (9.7 m²)). The preferred hibernacula often had multiple entrances promoting airflow. Hibernacula choice <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> {{the ability of the}} outside landscape to provide adequate forage upon arrival at the hibernacula as well as the specific microclimate inside. Having forested areas around the hibernacula entrance and low amounts of open farmland may be important factors influencing the suitability of hibernacula.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} structure permits {{members of}} Congress {{to study a}} particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress. As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience. Senators often choose a different specialty {{from that of the}} other senator from their state to prevent overlap. Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs.|$|E
