40|$|In NASA's plan to put <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> {{there were}} three {{sequential}} programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. The Gemini program was used to develop and integrate the technologies that would be necessary for the Apollo program to successfully put <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> We would like to present an analogous modern approach that leverages legacy ISS hardware designs, and integrates developing new technologies into a flexible architecture This new architecture is scalable, sustainable, {{and can be used}} to establish human exploration infrastructure beyond low earth orbit and into deep space...|$|R
5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit {{the federal government to}} a program to land a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Indicud is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist Kid Cudi. The album was released on April 12, 2013, by Republic Records. It was the first album of Cudi's solo career to not be an installment of his <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> series. The album's cover artwork was designed by Kid Cudi himself, who also served as an executive producer of Indicud. It was Cudi's goal to make more uptempo and positive music with the album. He {{described it as a}} completely new format compared to his previous albums.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she {{was in the process of}} writing a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E
50|$|The Soviets {{continued}} {{striving for}} the first lunar mission with the huge N-1 rocket, which exploded on each of four unmanned tests shortly after launch. The Americans won the race to land <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> with Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969.|$|R
50|$|The first {{engineering}} application of goal programming, due to Ignizio in 1962, was {{the design and}} placement of <b>the</b> antennas employed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second stage of the Saturn V. This was used to launch the Apollo space capsule that landed <b>the</b> first <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the {{existing}} Apollo program was chartered by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961, to land <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> it became evident to NASA officials that a follow-on to the Mercury program {{was required to}} develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of Apollo.|$|R
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E

40|$|The Apollo {{program was}} {{designed}} to land <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> and return them safely to earth. The Apollo lunar missions were informally divided into series, each series having similar spacecraft configurations, number of experiments, and complexity of tasks. Specific information on these missions is given...|$|R
2500|$|His elder brother, Major General James Lawton Collins, {{was also}} in the army. His nephew, Michael Collins, was the command module pilot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Apollo 11 mission in 1969 that put <b>the</b> first two <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and would retire as a major general from the United States Air Force.|$|R
2500|$|Cronkite is also {{remembered for}} his {{coverage}} of the United States space program, and at times was visibly enthusiastic, rubbing his hands together on camera {{with a smile and}} uttering, [...] "Whew...boy" [...] on July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission put <b>the</b> first <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1968, the Naval Air Station {{was given}} {{a major role in}} John F.

25|$|Koechner {{first became}} {{involved}} in performing when he began studying improvisational comedy in Chicago at ImprovOlympic, under the teachings of Del Close, before joining the Second City Northwest. After yearlong stints of doing sketch comedy on Saturday Night Live and Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the mid 1990s, Koechner began appearing with small roles in the films such as Wag the Dog, , and <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Landing <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> by <b>the</b> end of 1969 {{required}} the most sudden burst of technological creativity, {{and the largest}} commitment of resources ($24 billion) ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and {{required the}} support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities.|$|R
2500|$|Jay Weidner – {{author and}} {{interviewee}} about <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> conspiracy {{theory in the}} documentary film Room 237 (2012).

50|$|The Fallout series {{takes place}} in a subtly {{different}} universe. For example, the ship that landed <b>the</b> first <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> in 1969 is called Valiant 11, rather than Apollo 11. This universe diverged from ours after World War II, which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.|$|R
25|$|Lunar House {{is another}} {{high-rise}} building. Like other government office buildings on Wellesley Road, such as Apollo House, {{the name of}} the building was inspired by the US moon landings (In the Croydon suburb of New Addington there is a public house, built during the same period, called The <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon).</b> Lunar House houses the Home Office building for Visas and Immigration. Apollo House houses The Border Patrol Agency.|$|E
25|$|The United States of America (U.S.) {{acknowledged}} the immense success of Apollo 11 {{with a national}} day of celebration on Monday, July 21, 1969. All but emergency and essential employees were allowed a paid day off from work, in both government and the private sector. Coincidentally, the last time this had happened was the national day of mourning on Monday, November 25, 1963, to observe the state funeral of President John F. Kennedy, who had set the political goal to put a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> {{by the end of}} the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Decades later, most of {{the cast}} {{returned}} to play their younger selves and briefly re-enact scenes for the Kaufman biopic <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Jeff Conaway, Carol Kane, Randall Carver, J. Alan Thomas and Christopher Lloyd all reprised their roles. The only two living members of the cast who did not were Danny DeVito, who produced and co-starred in the film as Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, and Tony Danza, {{who at the time}} of filming was performing in A View from the Bridge on Broadway.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, {{were also}} of Scottish descent; Armstrong wore a kilt in a parade through his ancestral home of Langholm in the Scottish Borders in 1972. Other Scottish American moonwalkers were the fourth, Alan Bean, the fifth, Alan Shepard, the seventh, David Scott (also {{the first to}} drive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon),</b> and <b>the</b> eighth, James Irwin.|$|R
5|$|After the accident, NASA {{decided to}} give the flight the {{official}} designation of Apollo 1 and then skip to Apollo 4 for the first unmanned orbital test of the CSM, counting the two unmanned suborbital tests AS-201 and 202 {{as part of the}} sequence. The spacecraft problems were corrected, and the Apollo program carried on to reach its objective of landing <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> successfully.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, Lawler {{appeared}} in the movie <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> starring Jim Carrey. According to Lawler's autobiography, It's Good To Be The King... Sometimes, an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman {{and at one point}} spit on Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982. A 'stunned' Lawler reacted by grabbing Carrey by the hair and locked him in a sleeper hold and jerking his neck—supposedly sending Carrey to the hospital.|$|E
25|$|With the Americans {{planning}} a space walk with their Gemini program, the Soviets decided to trump them again by performing a space {{walk on the}} second Voskhod launch. After rapidly adding an airlock, the Voskhod 2 was launched on 18 March 1965, and Alexei Leonov performed the world's first space walk. The flight very nearly ended in disaster, as Leonov was just barely able to re-enter through the airlock, and plans for further Voskhod missions were shelved. In the meantime the change of Soviet leadership {{with the fall of}} Khrushchev meant that Korolev was back in favor and given charge of beating the US to landing a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} envisaged {{that the pilot}} could be any man or woman {{willing to take a}} {{personal}} risk. However, the first Americans to venture into space were drawn, on President Eisenhower's insistence, from a group of 508 active duty military test pilots, who were either USN or USMC naval aviation pilots (NAPs), or USAF pilots of Senior or Command rating. This excluded women, since there were no female military test pilots at the time. It also excluded civilian NASA X-15 pilot Neil Armstrong, though he had been selected by the U.S. Air Force in 1958 for its Man In Space Soonest program, which was replaced by Mercury. Although Armstrong had been a combat-experienced NAP during the Korean War, he left active duty in 1952. Armstrong became NASA's first civilian astronaut in 1962 when he was selected for NASA's second group, and became the first <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The first {{development}} Lunar Module, LM-1 {{was flown}} unmanned (B mission) as Apollo 5. A second unmanned test was planned using LM-2 but was canceled as unnecessary.
