50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> retains {{most of the}} lignin {{present in}} the wood {{used to make the}} pulp and thus contain almost as much lignin as they do {{cellulose}} and hemicellulose. It would be impractical to remove this much lignin by bleaching, and undesirable since one of the big advantages of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> is the high yield of pulp based on wood used. Therefore, the objective of bleaching <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (also referred to as brightening) is to remove only the chromophores (color-causing groups). This is possible because the structures responsible for color are also more susceptible to oxidation or reduction.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two major}} <b>mechanical</b> pulps: {{thermomechanical}} <b>pulp</b> (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper.

40|$|Bond {{strength}} is classically characterized into two separate factors; {{area of the}} bond and specific bond strength. This separation is especially important in pulps that lack strength properties, and are specifically used for their optical properties, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> In this research {{the applicability of the}} Ingmansson and Thode method for distinguishing between specific bonded area and specific bond strength in <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is studied. It is shown that the rigid, non-collapsable, nature of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> can be overcome by press drying the sheets until they approach their 50 % relative humidity moisture content. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> have been assumed to operate in a domain where fiber failure can be considered insignificant, and the bonded area to tensile strength relationship is linear. In this study it was shown that most commercial pulps operate in a significant fiber failure domain. However, it is shown that pure fines and fines rich <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> better follow a linear bonded area to tensile strength relationship rather than a non-linear (significant fiber failure) model, suggesting that only the fiber fraction undergoes fiber failure and the finer fractions predominantly bond failure. The Ingmansson and Thode method relies on the use of scattering coefficient as a measure of specific surface area. It is shown that scattering coefficient is an accurate estimate of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> specific surface area at a constant wavelength of light, provided that the wavelength used to measure scattering coefficient is above the significant absorption limit.

40|$|Corrected {{steady-state}} fluorescence emission {{spectra of}} various <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> and celluloses were measured using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Regardless of its source, cellulose displayed {{a relatively high}} characteristic emission. The emission spectra of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> were red-shifted with respect to that of cellulose, and peak shapes were influenced by the pulping process, by hydrogen peroxide bleaching and by monochromatic UV irradiation of the sheets. Changes in emission spectra due to bleaching or UV-irradiation occurred principally in the 370 - 440 and 500 - 550 nm regions, and were similar to changes in reflectance spectra reported in the literature. Fluorescence emission spectra of commercial lignins and lignin model compounds were blue-shifted with respect to <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps,</b> even upon absorption of the fluorophores on solid substrates. Concentration and inner filter effects were evident in emission spectra of commercial lignins, at concentrations as low as 60 ppm. These results suggest that, to a first approximation, emission spectra of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> may {{be interpreted as a}} decrease in emission of cellulose caused by light absorption by lignin; changes due to bleaching and irradiation may be attributed to changes in lignin absorption...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> {{industry}} faces continued rising {{energy costs}} and increasing competition for raw material. In {{order to produce}} improved products based on <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> at lower energy consumption {{it is necessary to}} {{have a better understanding of}} the development of fundamental fibre properties during the processes. In particular, changes in fibre collapsibility, fibre fibrillation and fibre and surface development are of great interest. The overall goal of the CRUW <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Pulping</b> project is “Support development of more energy efficient <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes by increasing the knowledge on ultrastructural phenomena in mechanical pulping”. This project is working closely together with the Industrial Research College for <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Pulping</b> Technology bringing in the ultrastructural competence to more clearly understand and explain phenomena observed in these projects thus making it easier to develop new and improved processes to reduce energy consumption. This report presents results from CRUW <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Pulping</b> sub-project 1 : ”Effect of different refining pressures and energy using spruce TMP pulps from Braviken”. The influence of temperature on the softening of lignin and hence improved (easier) fibre separation and treatment was noted earlier (Becker et al. 1977; Salmén 1984). Based on this knowledge, different process alternatives have been suggested to reduce energy demand for the refining process. One of the earliest publications on a technical system utilizing higher temperature and pressure was by Höglund et al. 1997 (Thermopulp). These results have been reproduced in many studies and are today considered general knowledge. There are however many practical problems with such a system. For example, the resulting very small refining gaps are difficult to control and it has therefore taken time to establish this technology in the industry. In the new TMP line at Braviken, the refiners are equipped to run at higher temperature/pressure than normal and it has therefore been interesting to study these pulps in order to explain the effects on pulp/fibres at an ultrastructural level. It should be noted that in a fibre-water-steam system, temperature and pressure are not independent variables and higher pressure means higher temperature and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|When {{producing}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> the fibre separation {{will take}} place in the weakest part of the wood matrix. A prerequisite to swelling in wood and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is that the wood matrix is softened. The position of where the weakest part of the wood matrix is situated can to a large extent be controlled by adjustment of the swelling and softening properties of each of the wood polymers (lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose). Most probably the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation of the fibre walls is also influenced by how the swelling and softening properties are controlled. The combination of position of fibre-fibre separation together with the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation will to a large extent determine the energy demand to produce <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> Refining of wood chips with different state of softening and swelling will give rise to fibres with different optical and physical properties. The most important parameters that influence the wood matrix and wood fibres’ ability to swell are temperature, pH, ionic form of and the amount of charged groups in the hemicelluloses and lignin of the cell walls. In order to improve the level of knowledge on how to influence the degree of wood matrix and fibre wall swelling of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> we have undertaken to study the swelling properties of wood and fibres produced by means of different <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes. It was found that pulps not containing sulphonic acid groups need to be heated above the softening temperature of lignin {{in order to be able}} to swell to their full capacity. Introduction of sulphonic acid groups also opens up the rigid structure of lignin which lowers the softening temperature and increases the swelling potential even at lower temperatures. The effect of valence of the counter ion was also shown to be more pronounced after adding more carboxylic acid groups to a pulp. Depending on the number and type of anionic acid groups in the fibres, high-yield pulps will have different combinations of properties in different ionic conditions. The preliminary conclusions from this study are that the ability to control swelling properties of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is an important feature to take into account when producing pulp and paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the reasons why the long fibres of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> do not seem to reinforce paper as effectively as chemical reinforcement pulp. A preliminary laboratory trial showed that artificially increasing the average fibre length of TMP pulp by adding long fibres extracted from the same pulp increased the tear index, but decreased the tensile strength, internal bond strength and the fracture energy. Increasing the average fibre strength with chemical (NBSK) pulp fibres improved all of those properties considerably. In the second trial fibre properties and reinforcement ability of various <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> were investigated. It was shown that fibre dimensions of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres did not differ essentially from chemical pulp fibres. The biggest differences were in the properties characterizing the cell wall structure. This was clearly seen in fibre flexibility and fibre swelling (WRV), for instance. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres are evidently more damaged than chemical pulp fibres which is seen as a much lower fibre strength (zero-span tensile strength). The reinforcement potential, on the grounds of fracture energy, tear strength and tensile strength of handsheets was much lower for <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres than for chemical pulp. In the third trial, mechanical (MRP) and chemimechanical reinforcement pulp (CMRP) was manufactured from Norway spruce (P. abies) on a pilot scale. The focus was to increase fibre flexibility, bonding ability and maintain the fibre length and strength. The runnability of LWC base paper made from the trial pulps was tested using the KCL AHMA runnability tester. In spite of the good strength properties of the trial pulps, they did not have the same overall reinforcement ability than chemical pulp. The sulphonated trial pulp (CMRP) gave the same tensile stiffness and tensile strength as the chemical pulp. However, the fracture properties and extensibility of the paper was worse with it. The lower average length of the trial pulps did not explain the difference totally. Scaling the fibre length with the zero-span tensile strength improved the explanatory power essentially. It was concluded that the low fibre strength is the basic reason for the poorer reinforcement ability of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> fibres over chemical ones...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{incentives}} {{for making the}} pulp washing process as efficient as possible: an efficient separation of the pulp from the black liquor will save {{a substantial amount of}} energy, reduce costs by reducing the need for make-up chemicals and improve the bleaching process. There are many discrepancies in the literature, however, as to how different parameters influence washing efficiency. It was thought that a new measurement technique which enables the concentration of different species to be measured inside the pulp bed during the washing process, would provide new data that could shed some light over the area of pulp washing. It was shown that the measurement technique worked well for the materials tested: sulphite, sulphate and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> and calcium silicate, respectively. The equipment functions better for materials with a long washing time, (i. e. calcium silicate and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp)</b> since the measurement error is dependent on the measurement time.

Producing pulp by means of these processes is a prerequisite for paper (such as printing paper and paperboard) grades requiring high printability and stiffness. However, <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Implementing BIGCC in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when more biomass from forest (such as branches and tree tops) is available. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency will be further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematical model is developed with ASPEN Plus. By means of modeling, three cases are studied: 1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding the reject fibres in the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %.
