50|$|The working {{principle}} of the <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> consists in the measurement of the torque necessary to rotate a disc in a cylindrical chamber filled with the rubber compound to be vulcanized. A number proportional with {{the value of this}} torque is taken as viscosity index (Mooney viscosity).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> is an {{instrument}} used {{for measuring the}} mooney viscosity of a substance (mainly elastomers and rubbers). [...] Invented by Melvin Mooney, it contains a rotating spindle and heated dies, the substance encloses and overflows the spindle and the mooney viscosity is calculated from the torque on the spindle.|$|E
50|$|Mooney {{viscosity}} is {{a measure}} of viscosity commonly used for rubbers taken at a certain temperature, named after Melvin Mooney. It is measured by a <b>mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> and is defined as the torque on instrument's rotating spindle within heated dies (the rubber compound must enclose and overflow the spindle in order for the measurement to be accurate). The unit for mooney viscosity is mooney units.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nature rubber (NR) {{is neither}} {{completely}} viscous nor elastic in nature, but viscoelastic in their properties. In the experiment, we used {{two types of}} equipments named rubber process analyzer (RPA) 2000 and <b>mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> to characterize the viscoelastic properties of NR dried by microwave and hot-air, respectively. In present research, RPA tests on uncured NR dried by different methods were carried out using frequency and strain sweeps, and <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> was detected using the big rotor at 100 ˚C. The results showed that microwave drying has not influenced the viscoelastic properties of NR greatly, without changing the profiles of its rheological behavior. Compared with hot-air drying, the properties of NR dried by microwave improved significantly. As a new application, microwave drying technology offered an alternative way to the drying of NR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Test of the {{rheology}} {{behavior for}} modified skim rubber (MSR) {{were carried out}} with rubber processing analyzer (RPA), and mooney viscosity were carried out with <b>Mooney</b> <b>Viscometer.</b> The results showed that mooney viscosity of MSR is lower than skim rubber, and it is higher than SCR- 5 (Chinese Standard Rubber- 5). The complex viscosity (n*) and the stress relaxation have same results with mooney viscosity, that MSR’s is higher than SCR- 5 and lower than skim rubber. The elastic torque (S’) is increased with the frequency rising, and the S ’ of MSR {{is in the middle}} of the all samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} Mooney measurement {{has been}} used for more than fifty years to characterize the rheological properties of natural rubber. According to interna-tional specifications, the Mooney viscos-ity of a material is the torque value read after subjecting the sample to shearing for 4 minutes, at 2 rpm, in a particular geometry. In this study, the Mooney viscosity of masticated and raw natural rubber was examined by using a multiple rotor speed <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer.</b> The double-logarithmic flow curve shows a decrease in the slope, which is charac-teristic of a transition from a proper flow regime to material failure, also observa-ble by capillary rheometry. For all the samples studied, this transition takes place at rotor speeds lower than 2 rpm. These results suggest that standard Mooney measurements performed on natural rubber give misleading results. A Mooney characterization of natural rubber at lower speeds is recommended...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{illustrates the}} opportunity of using field coagula directly as raw materials for rubber manufacturing without transforming to block or crepe rubber. Field coagula with different amounts of wood, mostly bark slivers, varying from 0 to 50 wt %, reveal a linear relationship between the viscosity and wood contents. The measurement of the viscosity is performed using an oscillating disk rheometer and a <b>Mooney</b> <b>Viscometer.</b> This linear relationship is independent {{of changes in the}} molecular weight of these samples and therefore confirms that the increasing of the viscosity observed here is due only to changes in wood content. The result of further investigation on more than twenty samples of field coagula also supported this linear relationship. This implies that the linear relationship found here may be general to all field coagula treated by the procedures stated herein and that it may be used as a tool in the production of rubber goods from field coagula. Additionally, this relationship is successfully used to prepare rubber/wood composites with the precise amounts of slivers from field coagula. </strong...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the Mooney scorch time and cure index on the blend ratio of chlorosulphonated polyethylene/natural rubber (CSM/SMR 20 CV) and chlorosulphonated polyethylene/chlorinated natural rubber (CSM/Pergut S 40) blends were determined in the temperature range from 120 oC to 160 oC using a Monsanto <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer.</b> Semi-efficient vulcanization systems {{were used for the}} study. The morphology of the fracture surface of the crosslinked systems was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the scorch time decreased with increasing SMR 20 CV and Pergut S 40 contents. This observation is attributed to the increasing solubility of sulfur, as the content of SMR 20 CV and Pergut S 40 in the composition increased. For temperatures greater than 140 oC, the {{dependence of}} the scorch time on blend ratios diminishes, as enough thermal energy is available to overcome the activation energy of vulcanization. The differing curing characteristics of the two blends is explained by the compatibility factor of the respective blend. Morphological analysis of the blends shows a very satisfactory agreement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The direct {{near-infrared}} spectroscopic reflectance {{measurements of}} prevul-canized natural rubber (brown crepe) was employed for determination of its Mooney viscosity. NIR reflectance spectra {{were obtained for}} a total of 100 samples whose Mooney viscosity (VM in the range 68 – 95 units) have been determined by the standard reference procedure using a commercial computerized <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer.</b> These samples were employed as the raw material or were treated to achieve better homogenization. A Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectrophotometer was employed, and the reflectance spectra were obtained with resolution of 4 cm 21 in the range 4000 – 10, 000 cm 21 as an average of 75 scans. The samples were split in a cali-bration set containing 70 samples and in an external validation set consisting of the remaining 30 samples. The calibration and validation spectra sets were treated to correct for baseline shift, further transformed by first derivative and finally modeled by partial least squares (PLS) employing four latent variables. The model was evaluated with the external sample test set, and a RMSEP of 3. 6 and 3. 9 units of Mooney viscosity were obtained for homogenized and nonhomogenized samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to reinforce natural rubber with silica prepared from rice husk. Rice husk was cleaned with tap water, then treated with 0. 4 M hydrochloric acid at 105 oC for 3 hours. The treated rice husk was burnt at 600 oC for 6 hours. The resulting white ash contained as high as 99. 6 % silica. The ash was ground with a jet mill and tested for its properties. It was found that silica from rich husk ash (RHA silica) had higher silica content, higher specific surface area and lower moisture content than commercial silica commonly used in rubber industries. RHA silica was then used as a reinforcing filler in natural rubber. The curing characteristics of natural rubber products using RHA silica and commercial silica were examined with an oscillating disk rheometer and a <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer.</b> Mechanical properties, namely, tensile strength, tear strength and hardness were determined. The results indicated that products reinforced with RHA silica had shorter curing times compared to those with commercial silica. Overall mechanical properties, i. e. tensile strength, tear strength, abrasion resistance, compression set and resilience, of rubber product...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rheological {{studies of}} {{polymers}} are {{of great importance}} in optimizing the processing conditions and in designing processing equipments like injection molding machines, extruders, and dies required for various products. Melt rheological studies give us valuable viscosity data that will be helpful in optimizing the processing conditions. Parameters like melt viscosity {{as a function of}} shear rate or shear stress and temperature have become more and more important. Previous study indicated that the flow behaviour of the compound depends on the filler loading. Lesser elastic torque was found with compound containing lower filler content as compared to higher filler content. In this work, effect of dual filler, based on Carbon Black / Silica filled Epoxidised Natural Rubber (ENR) compound was investigated. A total of 80 phr of filler content based on passenger tyre tread formulation was used in the experiment. The compounds were prepared by melt mixing in tangential type of an internal mixer. The rheological and the processability properties of the compounds were determined using three different testing instruments namely Capillary Rheometer, <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> and Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA). A variation of shear rates (ranging from low to high) was performed, in order to better reflect the actual processing condition in rubber manufacturing. It was found that ENR mix with ratio silica to carbon black 70 : 10 exhibited the best flow behaviour and processability properties as compared to control and other mixes...|$|E

Since the introduction of “Green Tyres” in the early 90 ’s, the use of silica as a reinforcing filler, along with a silane coupling agent, has spread and grown worldwide. The greatest advantage of using silica over carbon black as a reinforcing filler in a tyre tread compound is that a lower rolling resistance is achieved, while maintaining good wet traction. However, a previous study {{has shown that the}} wear resistance of a silica filled epoxidised natural rubber (ENR) compound was not as high as those of conventional Oil Extended Styrene Butadiene rubber (OESBR) and NR/BR compounds used in passenger car and truck tyre treads. In this work, with the aim of improving abrasion resistance, the effect of blending Butadiene rubber (BR) into a silica filled ENR compound was studied. Blends with 0 to 30 phr BR were prepared in a Polylab Haake internal mixer. The rheological properties of the compounds were measured using a <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer</b> and Oscilating Disc Rheometer. The hardness, tensile strength and DIN abrasion resistance were also measured. The results showed that the ENR/silica compound properties such as tensile strength and hardness were as good as those of the conventional compounds. However, the most important finding was that abrasion resistance increased significantly with BR content, exceeding that of the conventional compound at BR:ENR ratios of greater than 20 : 80...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As an aid to understanding the mechanics of mixing in an internal mixer laboratory scale trials {{have been carried out}} using a mixer having a transparent plastics chamber. The use of a transparent rubber and coloured 'markers' then permitted direct viewing of the characteristic flow patterns deriving from the use of three fill factors. These mixing trials have indicated the rheological properties which must be measured in order to predict the mixing behaviour of a rubber. Also considerable information is contained in the visualisations which will aid further work into control and instrumentation strategies and into fundamental design/mathematical modelling studies. A laboratory Banbury mixer and Brabender Plastograph are used to prepare the rubber compounds which are then characterised for the dispersion of compounding ingredients. For carbon black dispersion studies several techniques are employed. Capillary rheometry is used to study their stress-strain rate relationships and to obtain die swell, shear and tensile properties. Creep and elongational tests are also carried out on uncured mixes. In addition measurements on <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscometer,</b> Monsanto rheometer and analysis of bound rubber are made. These tests for filler dispersion are supported by microscopic examination of microtomed sections. Work is also geared to examine properties that are not only sensitive to changes in levels of carbon black dispersion but also that which are readily measured and can be used in industry. Measurements of mechanical phase angle and electrical resistivity are considered. Dispersion of non-black compounding ingredients is studied by X-ray microradiographic technique and the analysis of vulcanisate properties. To relate the performance of the Plastograph and Banbury mix the concept of mixing energy per unit volume of material is used...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{precision}} rubber parts and complex rubber components for the automotive sector. The quality requirements rising thereby lead to the increasing meaning of the quality assurance and the quality management in the rubber industry. In the rubber processing, there is an extra step or processing phase the material compounding step, which {{does not exist in}} the processing of plastics. This additional discontinual processing step may account for the higher risk for deviation between rubber batches or within a batch. This in turn may lead to problems in the subsequent stages and result in deviations in the final product properties. This thesis propounds guidelines and methods for efficient process analysis and optimization with particular focus on the rubber mixing process in an internal mixer. The research methods used for this thesis were process analyses and modeling which allowed the exact determination of correlation between the mixing process {{and the rest of the}} process chain. The experiments carried out focused on selected steps of the production of the rubber parts on mixing process in the rubber internal mixer, transfer molding process an on the injection molding process. In the rubber industry, there are many different testing approaches used and their validity is not always sufficient. At the same time they are inappropriate. Consequently the rubber characterization methods were analyzed. The focal point of the investigations was to find out the method most correlated to the rubber behavior of the rubber compound during processing and to the properties of the final product. As an approach to this problem statistical methods of the process analysis, like correlation analysis or regression were used. The validity of the rubber compound testing methods was determinated by correlational coefficient and the coefficient of certainty. The results showed that there is a direct correlation between the viscose and elastic compound properties and the qualities of the final product. In additional to that the rheological properties of the rubber mixture gives valuable information about the processing behavior in an injection molding machine and mold. The investigations were carried out using various measuring methods such as Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA), High Pressure Rheometer, Rheovulkameter, <b>Mooney</b> <b>Viscometer.</b> The RPA and the Mooney-Viscometer measurements proved to be the most accurately (reliable) of the method used. This thesis also covers the development and application of mathematical models for online-prediction of the compound properties during the mixing process in an internal mixer using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and linear regression analysis. These methods were used to predict the different rubber compound properties based on different types of rubber and on different fillers (carbon blacks and silica). Using the regression models in most cases it was possible to describe the interrelationship with a very high level of certainty. The advantages of using models based on ANN were evident when dealing with non linear interrelationships, e. g. (for silica-compound) In this case it was possible to achieve coefficients of certainty of about 90 %. It was possible to prove the practical relevance of this modeling method for a tire compound produced in a 320 liters production internal rubber mixer. In this case it was possible to calculate the compound property – Mooney-viscosity with a high degree of certainty using ANN. Based on the results, an online prediction system was developed, presented and explored in this thesis. This system can be used in practice to reduce the number of compound tests carried out for quality control in the rubber industry...|$|E
