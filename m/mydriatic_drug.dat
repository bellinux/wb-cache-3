If it is intended as an immediate follow up to another <b>mydriatic</b> <b>drug</b> (cocaine or apraclonidine), then the patient must wait anywhere from a day to a week before 4-hydroxyamphetamine can be administered. It also has the tendency to falsely localize lesions. False localization can arise in cases of acute onset; in cases where a postganglionic lesion is present, but the nerve still responds to residual norepinephrine; or in cases in which unrelated nerve damage masks {{the presence of a}} preganglionic lesion.|$|E
40|$|Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) is an {{antibody}} fragment with high binding affinity for all isoforms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and is specifi-cally developed for intraocular use. Since its introduc-tion in 2007 {{it has been}} administered increasingly and in our hospital approximately 1650 intravitreal injections were given in 2013. Ranibizumab is injected monthly and in most patients for a prolonged period of time. During the procedure several ophthalmic solutions are used, such as local anaesthetic, disinfection, <b>mydriatic</b> <b>drugs</b> and antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the related factors {{and treatment of}} choroidal detachment after glaucoma filtering surgery. METHODS: The clinical data of 42 eyes with choroidal detachment of 457 eyes undergoing glaucoma filtering were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Choroidal detachment occurred at 3 - 7 days after glaucoma filtering surgery, with mean 4. 51 ± 1. 14 days. The patient's average age was 65. 30 ± 3. 50 years. Chroidal detachment was reformed by corticosteroids medicine <b>mydriatic</b> <b>drugs</b> hypertonic agent and all recovered, within 16. 50 ± 2. 75 days. CONCLUSION: Chroidal detachment is a common complication of glaucoma filtering surgery. The related factors include high intraocular pressure and eyeball congestion before surgery, postoperative low intraocular pressure, diabetes, hypertension and the aged...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{maximize}} {{effective use}} of <b>mydriatic</b> <b>drugs</b> through comparing the pupillary dilation effects between 1 % tropicamide and 2. 5 % phenylephrine. Methods: Fifty people requiring pupillary dilation were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 was treated with one drop of 1 % tropicamide in the right eye and one drop of 2. 5 % phenylephrine in the left eye. Group 2 was treated twice during a 5 -minute interval with 1 % tropicamide in the right eye. Group 3 was treated twice during a 5 -minute interval with 2. 5 % phenylephrine in the right eye. Groups 2 and 3 were treated with 2. 5 % phenylephrine and 1 % tropicamide in the left eye, administered during a 5 -minute interval. The pupillary size was measured in all groups for 40 minutes following eye drops administration. Results: The mean patient age was 15. 7 years. Group 1 included 10 patients, and groups 2 and 3 included 20 patients each. Eight patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2 developed a larger right pupil. Fourteen patients in group 3 developed a larger left pupil. Conclusions: Our study showed that 1 % tropicamide, with its parasympathetic antagonistic mechanism of action, was more effective at inducing pupillary dilation than 2. 5 % phenylephrine, and the combination of 1 % tropicamide and 2. 5 % phenylephrine was more effective than multiple drops of single eye drops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the turtle has a consensual pupillary light response (cPLR), and if so, to compare it to its direct pupillary light response (dPLR). One eye was illuminated with different intensities of light over a four log range while keeping the other eye in darkness. In the eye directly illuminated, pupil diameter was reduced by as much as ∼ 31 %. In the eye not stimulated by light, pupil diameter was also reduced but less to ∼ 11 %. When compared to the directly illuminated eye, this generated a ratio, cPLR–dPLR, equal to 0. 35. Ratio of slopes for log/linear fits to plots of pupil changes versus retinal irradiance for non-illuminated (− 1. 27) to illuminated (− 3. 94) eyes closely matched at 0. 32. cPLR had time constants ranging from 0. 60 to 1. 20 min; however, they were comparable and not statistically different from those of the dPLR, which ranged from 1. 41 to 2. 00 min. Application of <b>mydriatic</b> <b>drugs</b> to the directly illuminated eye also supported presence of a cPLR. Drugs reduced pupil constriction by ∼ 9 % for the dPLR and slowed its time constant to 9. 58 min while simultaneous enhancing constriction by ∼ 6 % for the cPLR. Time constant for the cPLR at 1. 75 min, however, was not changed. Results support that turtle possesses a cPLR although less strong than its dPLR...|$|R

Case presentation: We report {{the case of a}} 3 -month-old male infant with bilateral corneal opacity since birth who was transferred from the pediatric unit for further ophthalmic care. He was diagnosed with PA with subsequent systemic-associated malformations including craniofacial defects and skeletal defects. He was managed minimally with topical <b>mydriatics</b> and antiglaucomatous <b>drugs.</b> Conclusion: PA is an inevitable cause of blindness in developing countries due to poor infrastructure and limited resources.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{acute angle}} closure attacks induced by local and {{systemic}} medications. DATA SOURCES: PubMed literature searches up to August 2011. STUDY SELECTION: The following key words {{were used for}} the search: 'drug', 'iatrogenic', 'acute angle closure glaucoma'. DATA EXTRACTION: A total of 86 articles were retrieved using the key words. Only those concerning acute angle closure attack triggered by local or systemic drug administration were included. For articles on the same or related topics, those published at later or more recent dates were selected. As a result, 44 articles were included and formed the basis of this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: An acute attack of angle closure can be triggered by dilatation of the pupil, by anatomical changes in the ciliary body and iris, or by movement of the iris-lens diaphragm. Local and systemic medications that cause these changes have the potential to precipitate an attack of acute angle closure. The risk is higher in subjects who are predisposed to the development of angle closure. Many pharmaceutical agents including ophthalmic eyedrops and systemic drugs prescribed by general practitioners and various specialists (in psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, medicine, and anaesthesia) can precipitate an acute angle closure attack. The medications include: anti-histamines, anti-epileptics, antiparkinsonian agents, antispasmolytic <b>drugs,</b> <b>mydriatic</b> agents, sympathetic agents, and botulinum toxin. CONCLUSION: Since acute angle closure attack is a potentially blinding eye disease, it is extremely important to be vigilant and aware of ophthalmic and systemic medications that can lead to such attacks in predisposed subjects and to diagnose the condition when it occurs. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
