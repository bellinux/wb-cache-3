The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is a group of five islands of Gaya, Manukan, Mamutik, Sapi and Sulug. These islands are believed to once connected to the Crocker Range but separated when sea levels rose since the last ice age. The Tun Mustapha <b>Marine</b> <b>Park</b> is the largest <b>marine</b> <b>park</b> located in the north of Sabah. It covers the three major islands of Banggi, Balambangan and Malawali. Another <b>marine</b> <b>park</b> is the Tun Sakaran <b>Marine</b> <b>Park</b> located in the south-east of Sabah. The park comprising the islands of Bodgaya, Boheydulang, Sabangkat and Salakan along with sand cays of Maiga, Mantabuan and Sibuan. Bodgaya is gazetted as a forest reserve, while Boheydulang as a bird sanctuary. These islands are formed by Quaternary pyroclastic material that was ejected during explosive volcanic activities.|$|E
5|$|National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are a {{relatively}} new invention in the park system. Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, created in 2015, is the only unit that uses this designation in its name. Fathom Five National <b>Marine</b> <b>Park</b> was created in 1987, prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing its legal name. The case of Saguenay-St. Lawrence <b>Marine</b> <b>Park</b> is similar, while Gwaii Haanas is an NMCA Reserve, {{with the intention of}} becoming an NMCA.|$|E

There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.|$|E

50|$|At {{the present}} time, the <b>Marine</b> <b>Parks</b> Board (that {{was created to}} oversee the {{management}} and conservation of all <b>marine</b> <b>parks</b> in SVG), functions as the Board of Management for the TCMP, overseeing its day-to-day operations. The current arrangement lacks local involvement in decision making and gives too much responsibility to the board for operational matters rather than policy issues and national coordination. With four other <b>marine</b> <b>parks</b> proposed in the 2004 Protected Areas Systems Plan (IJA, 2004a), there is an urgent need to put {{the management of the}} TCMP and any future <b>marine</b> <b>parks</b> on firmer ground.

5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} {{for the preservation of}} the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos <b>Marine</b> <b>Park,</b> that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E
5|$|Jaws 3-D (also {{known as}} Jaws 3 or Jaws III) is a 1983 American thriller film {{directed}} by Joe Alves and starring Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Lea Thompson, and Louis Gossett, Jr. It {{is the second}} sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws and the third installment in the Jaws franchise. The film follows the Brody children from the previous films at SeaWorld, a Florida <b>marine</b> <b>park</b> with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young great white shark infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, it becomes apparent {{that it was a}} second, much larger shark who also entered the park, that was the real culprit.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef <b>Marine</b> <b>Park.</b> This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E

50|$|A <b>marine</b> mammal <b>park</b> (also {{known as}} <b>marine</b> animal <b>park</b> and {{sometimes}} oceanarium) is a commercial theme park or aquarium where marine mammals such as dolphins, beluga whales and sea lions are kept within water tanks and displayed {{to the public}} in special shows. A <b>marine</b> mammal <b>park</b> is more elaborate than a dolphinarium, because it also features other marine mammals and offers additional entertainment attractions. It is thus seen as a combination of a public aquarium and an amusement <b>park.</b> <b>Marine</b> mammal <b>parks</b> are different from <b>marine</b> <b>parks,</b> which include natural reserves and marine wildlife sanctuaries such as coral reefs, particularly in Australia.|$|R
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a <b>marine</b> <b>park.</b> His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
