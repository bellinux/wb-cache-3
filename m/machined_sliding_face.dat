50|$|Motorized linear <b>slides</b> such as <b>machine</b> <b>slides,</b> XY tables, roller {{tables and}} some {{dovetail}} slides are bearings moved by drive mechanisms. Not all linear slides are motorized, and non-motorized dovetail slides, ball bearing slides and roller slides provide low-friction linear movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. All linear slides provide linear motion based on bearings, {{whether they are}} ball bearings, dovetail bearings, linear roller bearings, magnetic or fluid bearings. XY Tables, linear stages, <b>machine</b> <b>slides</b> and other advanced slides use linear motion bearings to provide movement along both X and Y multiple axis.|$|R

50|$|A {{leadscrew}} (or lead screw), {{also known}} as a power screw or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and female members, screw threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, <b>machine</b> <b>slides</b> (such as in machine tools), vises, presses, and jacks.|$|R
5000|$|When {{applied to}} tricks {{involving}} obstacles, backside and frontside take on different meaning: the terms define how the obstacle is being approached. For example, when performing a frontside boardslide, [...] "frontside" [...] {{means that the}} obstacle (e.g. rail or ledge) is to the front (the toe-side) of the skateboarder. To carry out a frontside boardslide, a regular-stance skater will rotate slightly clockwise before <b>sliding,</b> <b>facing</b> away {{from the direction of}} travel. This is the opposite direction of rotation to a frontside ollie.|$|R
25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of <b>machine</b> <b>slides.</b> These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} nowadays to build CNC chucks in which the position and clamping pressure of each jaw can be precisely controlled with CNC, via closed-loop positioning and load monitoring. In essence, each jaw is one independent CNC axis, a <b>machine</b> <b>slide</b> with a leadscrew, and all four or six of them can act in concert with each other. Although this idea is conceptually interesting, the simpler chucking systems mentioned in the previous paragraph are probably a marketplace winner over this alternative for most applications, because they supply the same capabilities via a simpler, less expensive solution.|$|R

50|$|Acoustic or sonic {{lubrication}} {{occurs when}} sound (measurable {{in a vacuum}} by placing a microphone on one element of the sliding system) permits vibration to introduce separation between the <b>sliding</b> <b>faces.</b> This could happen between two plates or between a series of particles. The frequency of sound required to induce optimal vibration, and thus cause sonic lubrication, varies {{with the size of}} the particles (high frequencies will have the desired, or undesired, effect on sand and lower frequencies will have this effect on boulders).|$|R

5000|$|Most <b>machine</b> <b>slides</b> {{for many}} decades, and many even today, were simple-but-accurate cast iron linear bearing surfaces, {{such as a}} {{dovetail}} slide or box slide, with an Acme leadscrew drive. With just a simple nut, some backlash is inevitable. On manual (non-CNC) machine tools, the way that machinists compensate for the effect of backlash is to approach all precise positions using the same direction of travel. This means that {{if they have been}} dialing left, and now they want to move to a rightward point, they move rightward all the way past it and then dial leftward back to it. The setups, tool approaches, and toolpaths are designed around this constraint.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of apparatus: an arm-type {{parallelogram}} apparatus based on a hinged arm; and a track-type apparatus which moves on a rail mounted {{to the top of}} the drawing board. The accuracy of the arm type apparatus is better in the middle of the board, decreasing towards the edges, whereas a track machine has a constant accuracy over the whole board. The drawing head of a track-type drafting <b>machine</b> <b>slides</b> on bearings in a vertical rail, which in turn is moved along a horizontal, top-mounted rail. Both apparatus types have an adjustable drawing-head with rules attached to a protractor scale so that the angle of the rules may be adjusted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{decrease}} the thermal {{error in the}} machining of high speed machine tools, a new design idea based on the cellular metal structures was proposed. With forced convection in cellular metals, the heat generated in machining will be dissipated and the machining precision can be guaranteed. The thermal property of <b>machine</b> <b>slides</b> using 2 D rectangle cellular structures was studied with theoretical analyses and numerical simulation. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the finite element simulation results. The {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} and the thermal performance were acquired with the volume-averaging method and the relationships between the cellular porosity, cellular sizes and the thermal performance were discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{comparisons}} of performance characteristics between the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure developed in this laboratory to grind precisely the <b>sliding</b> <b>face</b> of a surface hardened workpiece with thermal spray and the conventional one are investigated {{by measuring the}} surface roughness and hardness for a SCM 440. To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the <b>sliding</b> <b>face</b> with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height. It is also found that the surface hardness of both the conventional and the super-mirror face grinding machines are increased as the particle size of diamond wheel is reduced...|$|R
