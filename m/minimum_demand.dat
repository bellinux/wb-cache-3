But in 2011 the {{football}} field there was in such a bad shape, that the Faroe Islands Football Association could not allow any adult teams to play there. TB Tvøroyri therefore arranged with one of the neighbour villages, Hvalba, that they would play their matches there in 2011. On 17 November 2011 they started to build a new football stadium in Trongisvágur, just west of the sports hall, the place is called við Stórá (which means By Grand River). They worked very hard to get the new home field ready for the clubs 120 years anniversary on 13 May 2012 and they made it. The new football field was ready in mid April, but it was not recognized for matches in the men's best division for the match against B36 Tórshavn as they had hoped for, the reason for this was that there were no seats yet, and the <b>minimum</b> <b>demand</b> for seats is 300. TB therefore played their home match against B36 Tórshavn in Vágur on 15 April 2012. They worked hard in order to get at least 300 seats around the football field, and that work finished on the Faroese flagday on 25 April 2012. Two days later on 27 April 2012 TB's new football field við Stórá was finally approved for matches in the men's best division. The football field officially opened on 29 April 2012. There was an opening ceremony just before TB played against ÍF Fuglafjørður, at the ceremony there were speeches by Andre Dalfoss, president of TB Tvøroyri and by Jens Johannesen, Chairman of Cultural Affairs of Tvøroyri Municipality and there was music by Tvøroyri Brass Band (Tvøroyrar Hornorkestur). Just a few minutes before the match started one of the former players of TB Tvøroyri Mr. Kristian Olsen, who at this time was 88 years old, got the honour to kick the first ball.

40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, {{the stress of}} rapidly growing populations, mismanagement of resources and changing climate has created a burden on already compromised water resources. In Africa, where {{a significant proportion of}} the population is without access to improved water source, the urgency for clean available water sources to sustain healthy and productive human and natural populations has become a priority. As a water scarce country, Kenya has seen an increased investment in rainwater harvesting (RWH) projects to harness the vastly untapped rainwater resource, particularly in rural areas. Most of RWH literature is centered on the potential and implementation of rainwater harvesting systems, however not much focus has been placed on examining the demand satisfaction of these systems. This study investigates the reliability of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RRWH) as a key priority source of water supply for domestic use in three towns in Western Kenya: Kisumu, Nakuru and Lodwar. This was done using two approaches (1) the fraction of time water was available and (2) the fraction of time that a <b>minimum</b> <b>demand</b> was met, with acceptable reliability of 0. 95 or higher. Actual rainfall data and RRWH parameters were used to produce supply/demand simulations of the system under Constant-Demand and Responsive-Demand scenarios over ten years. It was observed that all towns achieved acceptable reliability values for RRWH in terms of water availability however Lodwar only achieved demand satisfaction below 0. 95. This study concluded that though RRWH cannot satisfy the <b>minimum</b> <b>demand</b> requirement through all days of the year, it is more than able to provide an alternative water supply for the domestic household in periods of long dry spells or when primary water source are inadequate...|$|E

Based upon the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the individual parts of the GRUVAN project, the following recommendations were picked out as the most significant: -          Full scale fire experiments with respect to vehicle fires should be performed, resulting in heat release rate curves. -          Further studies and experiments should take place that vary additional parameters besides {{the distance between the}} individual fuel objects. -          The heat release rate curves of design fires involving all common vehicles should possibly be reconstructed using the potential theoretical methodology. -          The results from the full scale fire experiments should be compared with the corresponding results from one- or two-dimensional calculation models as well as three-dimensional CFD calculation models. -          The use of a CFD model together with a ventilation network simulation program should be further investigated. The results should be compared with corresponding fire experiments. -          Further studies of the applied mine ventilation network simulation program should be performed. -          Non-flammable hydraulic fluids are strongly recommended for use in underground mines. -          The lack of fire barriers should be investigated further and alternative methods should be looked into. -          During the work in the project {{it has been shown that}} the fire behaviour in loader cabs can be very rapid and have a large impact. Thus it is recommended that automatic extinguishing systems are installed in loader cabs that are manned. -          The research has shown that the time space for smoke spread during a large fire in an underground mine is larger than the <b>minimum</b> <b>demand</b> on the air supply in refuge chambers.
