Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done.

He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> human family”.|$|E

A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has.

It's always a tragedy to lose anyone. Uncle Bill was a great driver and a good friend. He’d done a lot of tours with me, and we’re all going to miss him." [...] Although the cause for the accident remains undefined, authorities confirmed the roads were wet from overnight rain. However, CBS News reported that speed and weather were not attributed as factors for the accident's occurrence.

500|$|Glazunov {{adds that}} his {{relationship}} with Tchaikovsky changed from the elder composer being [...] "not ... one of our own" [...] to a close friendship that would last until Tchaikovsky's death. [...] "I met Tchaikovsky quite often both at Balakirev's and at my own home", Glazunov remembered. [...] "We usually met over music. He always appeared in our social circle {{as one of the}} most welcome guests; besides myself and Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev were also constant <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> circle." [...] This circle, with which Tchaikovsky would spend an increasing amount of time in the last couple of years of his life, would come to be known as the Belyayev circle, named after its patron, Belyayev. According to musicologist Richard Taruskin, Belyayev, through his financial influence, would shape Russian music more greatly and lastingly than either Balakirev or Stasov were able to do.|$|E

Local H, according to the band's Twitter account, created their name by combining two R.E.M. songs: [...] "Oddfellows Local 151" [...] and [...] "Swan Swan H". Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was a vocal fan of R.E.M., and had plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe before his death in April 1994.

500|$|Legal {{historian}} John Phillip Reid {{has written}} that {{the emphasis on the}} political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists. [...] Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was [...] "continually {{in the hands of the}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Congress". Armitage writes, [...] "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was [...] "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. [...] The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.|$|E
500|$|Following the February 2013 {{symposium}} [...] "Racist Stereotypes and Cultural Appropriation in American Sports" [...] at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, 10 {{members of}} Congress {{sent a letter}} to the Redskins' owner and the NFL Commissioner requesting that the name be changed since it is offensive to Native Americans. In response, Daniel Snyder famously told USA Today: [...] "We'll never change the name.... It's that simple. NEVER—you can use caps." [...] Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in The Washington Post on October 9, 2013; he stated that the most important meaning of the name is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Indian Fund on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation when designing the logo. In 2013, the Red Cloud Athletic Fund {{sent a letter to}} the Washington Post stating that [...] "As an organization, Red Cloud Indian School has never—and will never—endorse the use of the name 'Redskins'.

500|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Sentient animals, Cochrane argues, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on the situation in question. Cochrane explores the consequences of the account in his Animal Rights Without Liberation, arguing that, with very few exceptions, nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing, animal agriculture, in entertainment, for environmental purposes and in cultural practices. Despite this, because Cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals, his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts. In a 2016 article, Cochrane extended his interest-based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals, on the basis that working animals are <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> society and workers. These rights include a right to representation in a union, a right to [...] "just and favourable remuneration", a right to safe and healthy conditions of work, and a right to time off from work.|$|E
