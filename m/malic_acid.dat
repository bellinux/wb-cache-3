5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the interplay between}} heat of hydration and physico-mechanical properties of calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate {{in the presence of}} retarding additives such as citric and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> and sodium citrate. The heat of hydration was measured using a semi-isothermal calorimeter. Results proved that citric and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> had superior impact on hydration and mechanical properties. While the concentration of additives was increasing, the maximum heat of hydration was decreasing from 56. 15 cal/g. min for blank sample to 33 cal/g. min for high concentrations of citric and <b>malic</b> <b>acids.</b> Consequently, the measured time to this maximum heat of hydration and thus the induction period were increased significantly from 5 to 105 min.

25|$|<b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> can {{be further}} reduced during the {{winemaking}} process through malolactic fermentation or MLF. In this process, bacteria convert the stronger <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> into the softer lactic acid; formally, <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is polyprotic (contributes multiple protons, here two), while lactic acid is monoprotic (contributes one proton), and thus has only half the effect on acidity (pH); also, the first acidity constant (pKa) of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> (3.4 at room temperature) {{is lower than the}} (single) acidity constant of lactic acid (3.86 at room temperature), indicating stronger acidity. Thus after MLF, wine has a higher pH (less acidic), and a different mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (unripe) apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in enzymatic reactions that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in grape berries are at their peak just before veraison, when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|E

This oxygen-sparing effect is correlated with the wavelengths of light that are associated with bacteriochlorophyll absorbance. Increasing concentrations of glutamic, succinic, and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> enhance the oxygen-sparing effect of light until a threshold concentration is reached, beyond which succinic and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> decrease the effect.

25|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{tends to}} create a rounder, fuller mouthfeel. <b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> is typically associated with the taste of green apples, while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity, much of which comes from the contribution of <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine, producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, a {{bacterial}} process, natural or controlled, {{is often used}} to convert the naturally present <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> to lactic acid, to reduce the sharpness and for other flavor-related reasons.

5000|$|Tartaric acid {{plays an}} {{important}} role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting [...] "must" [...] to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation.

Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|R
25|$|The {{bacteria}} {{behind this}} {{process can be}} found naturally in the winery, in cooperages, which make oak wine barrels that will house a population of the bacteria or they can be introduced by the winemaker with a cultured specimen. For some wines, the conversion of malic into lactic acid can be beneficial, especially if the wine has excessive levels of <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> For other wines, such as Chenin blanc and Riesling, it produces off flavors in the wine (such as the buttery smell of diacetyl) {{that would not be}} appealing for that variety. In general, red wines are more often put through MLF than whites, which means a higher likelihood of finding <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in white wines (though notable exceptions, such as oaked Chardonnay, are often put through MLF).|$|E
25|$|Throughout Southeast Asia, {{the fruit}} of the {{tamarind}} is used as a poultice applied to foreheads of fever sufferers.

25|$|Tartaric acid is, from a {{winemaking}} perspective, {{the most}} important in wine due to the prominent role it plays in maintaining the chemical stability of the wine and its color and finally in influencing {{the taste of the}} finished wine. In most plants, this organic acid is rare, but it is found in significant concentrations in grape vines. Along with <b>malic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} citric acid, tartaric is one of the fixed acids found in wine grapes. The concentration varies depending on grape variety and the soil content of the vineyard. Some varieties, such as Palomino, are naturally disposed to having high levels of tartaric acids, while Malbec and Pinot noir generally have lower levels. During flowering, high levels of tartaric acid are concentrated in the grape flowers and then young berries. As the vine progresses through ripening, tartaric does not get metabolized through respiration like <b>malic</b> <b>acid,</b> so the levels of tartaric acid in the grape vines remain relatively consistent throughout the ripening process.|$|E

25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are fastidious organisms that cannot synthesize {{on their own}} all of their complex nutritional requirements.

25|$|Winemakers will {{sometimes}} add acids to the wine (acidification) {{to make the}} wine more acidic, most commonly in warm climate regions where grapes are often harvested at advanced stages of ripeness {{with high levels of}} sugars, but very low levels of acid. Tartaric acid is most often added, but winemakers {{will sometimes}} add citric or <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> Acids can be added either before or after primary fermentation.

25|$|Diacetyl in wine is {{produced}} by lactic acid bacteria, mainly Oenococcus oeni. In low levels it can impart positive nutty or caramel characters, however at levels above 5mg/L it creates an intense buttery or butterscotch flavour, where it {{is perceived as a}} flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} have {{a useful}} role in winemaking converting <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria {{may still be}} present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming turbid, swampy, and slightly effervescent or spritzy. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The uptake and {{bioavailability}} of lead (Pb) in soil–plant systems remain poorly understood. This {{study indicates}} that acetic and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> enhance the uptake of Pb by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) roots under hydroponic conditions. The net concen-tration-dependent uptake influx of Pb in the presence and absence of organic acids was characterized by Michaelis–Menten type nonsaturating kinetic curves that could be resolved into linear and saturable components. Fitted maximum uptake rates (Vmax) of the Michaelis–Menton saturable component {{in the presence of}} acetic and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> were, respectively, 2. 45 and 1. 63 times those of the control, while the Michaelis–Menten Km values of 5. 5, 3. 7 and 2. 2 lM, respectively, remained unchanged. Enhanced Pb uptake by organic acids was partially mediated by Ca 2 + and K+ channels, and also depended upon the physiological function of the plasma membrane P-type ATPase. Uptake may have been further enhanced by an effectively thinner unstirred layer of Pb adjacent to the roots, leading to more rapid diffusion towards roots. X-ray absorption spectro-scopic studies provided evidence that the coordination environment of Pb in wheat roots was similar to that of Pb(CH 3 COO) 23 H 2 O in that one Pb atom was coordinated to four oxygen atoms via the carboxylate group...|$|R

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight organic acids are important components of root exudates and therefore, knowledge regarding {{the mechanisms of}} cadmium (Cd) uptake and distribution within plants {{under the influence of}} organic acids, is necessary for a better understanding of Cd behavior in the plant-soil system. In this study, acetic and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> increased the uptake of Cd by maize (Zea mays L. cv. TY 2) roots and enhanced Cd accumulation in shoots under hydroponic conditions. Concentration-dependent net Cd influx in the presence and absence of organic acids could be resolved into linear and saturable components. The saturable component followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which indicated that Cd uptake across the plasma membrane was transporter-mediated. While the K (m) values were similar, the V (max) values in the presence of acetic and <b>malic</b> <b>acids</b> were respectively 6. 0 and 3. 0 times that of the control. Zinc transporters were the most probable pathways for Cd accumulation. It was hypothesized that Cd(II) -organic acid complexes associated with the root zone, could decompose and liberate Cd 2 + for subsequent absorption by maize roots; and that in the layer of the roots or within the root free space, depletion of Cd 2 + was buffered by the presence of Cd(II) -organic acid complexes. Plant response to elevated Cd levels involved overproduction of organic acids in maize roots as a resistance mechanism to alleviate Cd toxicity...|$|R
