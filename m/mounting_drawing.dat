40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of two types of IMPATT diode {{reflection}} amplifiers and a transmission amplifier are given. The Ku-band IMPATT diode development is discussed. Circuitry and electrical performance of {{the final version of}} the Ku-band amplifier is described. Construction details and an outline and <b>mounting</b> <b>drawing</b> are presented...|$|E
50|$|Thermal design - The BTX layout {{establishes}} a straighter path of airflow with fewer obstacles, resulting in better overall cooling capabilities. There is no dedicated CPU fan - instead, a large 12 cm case fan is <b>mounted,</b> <b>drawing</b> its air directly {{from outside the}} computer and cooling the CPU through an airduct. Another distinct feature of BTX is the vertical mounting of the motherboard on the left-hand side. This results in the graphics card heatsink or fan facing upwards, {{rather than in the}} direction of the adjacent expansion card.|$|R
5000|$|The Horse Cavalry Detachment's <b>mounted</b> drills are <b>drawn</b> {{from the}} U.S. Army's 1883 Manual of Cavalry Tactics.|$|R
60|$|Arnold Baxter understood, and at {{once took}} his son by the arm. The pair had come down into the hold {{by means of a}} ladder lowered through the forward hatchway. Now they ran for the ladder, <b>mounted,</b> and <b>drew</b> it up after them. Then the hatch was closed down as before.|$|R
50|$|In 1787 also, Vaughan visited <b>Mount</b> Vernon, and <b>drew</b> {{a plan of}} the garden. He gave Washington {{a marble}} mantelpiece for the house.|$|R
25|$|Three <b>mounted</b> {{officers}} <b>drawn</b> from No 1 Guard give drill commands {{during the}} parade. The most senior is the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting (rank of Lieutenant Colonel), assisted by the Major of the Parade. The Field Officer occupies a central {{position on the}} parade ground. The third mounted officer is the Adjutant.|$|R
50|$|The world {{holds its}} breath as the {{greatest}} military battle to ever take place threatens to obliterate {{all that remains of}} humanity. All seems lost. Tsion Ben-Judah and Buck Williams have been slain in Jerusalem, now overrun by Global Community forces. The hour of attack for Nicolae Carpathia’s Global Community Unity Army to assault the Rebels at the Temple <b>Mount</b> <b>draws</b> near. Mac McCullum goes to Jerusalem undercover to find Buck Williams and discovers his dead body before being ushered to a meeting with several more troops and Nicolae Carpathia's cabinet in Solomon's Stables. After witnessing Chaim Rosensweig preaching at Petra through live television and the death of a Global Community Officer, Satan temporarily leaves Carpathia's body and reminds the now trembling, feeble shell of Nicolae Carpathia that he is merely a shell for him before indwelling him once again.|$|R
5000|$|On February 13, 1933, The Toronto Evening Telegram began {{publishing}} McCall's {{comic strip}} Men of the <b>Mounted,</b> <b>drawn</b> by Harry Hall. [...] The strip starred Corporal Keene.It {{was the first}} strip based on the RCMP {{as well as being}} Canada's first regular adventure strip. [...] Syndicated across Canada, it ran for two years until King of the Royal Mounted, an American strip, began to be published. [...] McCall had approached King Features about syndicating his strip in the United States but was rejected. When King of the Royal Mounted was started, McCall felt they had plagiarized his idea. The last strip was published on February 16, 1935, the day before King of the Royal Mounted started. [...] The strips were also adapted into a Big Little Book published by Whitman Publishing and were featured in trading cards from Willard's Chocolates.|$|R
50|$|A {{drafting}} machine is a device which is <b>mounted</b> to the <b>drawing</b> board. It has rulers whose angles can be precisely adjusted with a controlling mechanism.|$|R
60|$|These preached and {{assisted}} at {{different parts of}} the services, while the vast multitude sat on the sloping hillside, and the <b>mounted</b> men <b>drew</b> up {{on the outskirts of the}} congregation, so as to be within sound of the preachers' voices, and, at the same time, be ready for action on the defensive if enemies should appear.|$|R
60|$|Accompanied by Terence, and {{followed}} {{by the rest of}} the officers, he rode along the line. The evening before Terence had impressed upon the captains of companies the necessity for having the rifles perfectly clean, as they were about to join a British camp, so that the pieces were all in perfect order. When the inspection was over the <b>mounted</b> group <b>drew</b> off a little.|$|R
60|$|He reappeared a {{few minutes}} later and claimed a dance, which she gave him, and some time had passed when a {{drumming}} of hoofs grew rapidly louder and two shadowy figures materialized out of the prairie. Then the music stopped as a couple of <b>mounted</b> police <b>drew</b> bridle in front of the astonished guests. One who carried a carbine across his saddle threw up his hand commandingly.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, Sarafinchan {{was asked}} by Harley Parker, another {{painting}} instructor at OCA, to join him and Marshall McLuhan in their redesign and new approach to exhibitions at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto. Sarafinchan’s main responsibility was {{to work with the}} trades in executing the ideas generated by the three of them in fulfilling their mandate to bring a more exciting, new, contemporary draw to the museum. Some of their exhibitions included a fashion show, masks and posters from around the world. And she continued to paint. In 1966, she was asked if she would like to hang a few of her works in the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority house (where she had become a member and had lived while at Art College). A three-day show was <b>mounted,</b> <b>drawing</b> a crowd of people and leading to the offer of a one-woman show at Toronto’s Pennell Gallery and an invitation to hang one of her paintings in Habitat at Expo ‘67 in Montreal (in the end, three were chosen).|$|R
60|$|The bugles {{had already}} sounded before {{he reached his}} own quarters, where he found that, thanks to Gaston, all was right. The tent had been taken down and packed on the baggage mules, the men were <b>mounted,</b> and <b>drawn</b> up in full array, with his banner {{floating}} above their heads; and Gaston himself was only waiting his appearance to mount a stout mule, which Martin, the horse-boy, was leading up and down.|$|R
50|$|On a hill {{above the}} river in Inverness stands Inverness Castle. Next to the castle is the Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. The river is {{overlooked}} by the Eden Court Theatre, {{one of the largest}} theatres in Scotland. St. Andrew's Cathedral also lies {{on the banks of the}} River Ness as does Old High St Stephen's which stands on a hill known as St Michael's <b>Mount.</b> Inverness <b>draws</b> many tourists and there are hotels along the river.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, Aïchele {{embarked}} on an artistic pilgrimage to Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia and <b>Mount</b> Athos. He <b>drew</b> particular inspiration from the medieval monasteries of Kosovo, particularly Gracanica Monastery, Studenica Monastery and Sopocani Monastery, {{as well as the}} Byzantine treasures of Mount Athos.|$|R
60|$|These two {{so-called}} forts were posts of {{very modest}} strength, {{a chain of}} which had been erected {{at the time of the}} old Zulu war. Fort Itala, the larger, was garrisoned by 300 men of the 5th <b>Mounted</b> Infantry, <b>drawn</b> from the Dublin Fusiliers, Middlesex, Dorsets, South Lancashires, and Lancashire Fusiliers--most of them old soldiers of many battles. They had two guns of the 69th R.F.A., the same battery which had lost a section the week before. Major Chapman, of the Dublins, was in command.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mount</b> Piper <b>draws</b> its {{cooling water}} from Lyell Dam and Thomsons Creek Dam, both purpose {{built for the}} station. Lyell Dam {{is located on the}} Coxs River 20 km away. Large pumps draw water from the dam and {{transfer}} it to a pipeline built between Thompsons Creek Dam and Mount Piper. The power station taking what water it needs and the excess flowing into Thompsons Creek Dam. When no pumps are in service the water supply to the power station is gravity fed from Thompsons Creek Dam.|$|R
60|$|Abdul, {{always on}} the alert, looked {{backward}} quite {{as often as he}} did ahead. At the top of each hillock that they <b>mounted</b> he would <b>draw</b> in his horse and, turning, scan the country to the rear with utmost care. At last his scrutiny was rewarded.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mount</b> Erin College <b>draws</b> {{students}} {{from a number of}} local primary schools, including Frankston Heights Primary and Kingsley Park Primary School, which are both within walking distance. Students come from Pearcedale, Baxter, as far south as Hastings and Bittern and as far north as Carrum Downs.|$|R
50|$|An annual pilgrimage {{has been}} held on the site since 1922. From 1922 to 1954 five to six {{thousand}} pilgrims were taking part each year {{with the exception of}} 1948 when an estimated 12,000 people attended during the Family Rosary Crusade. On July 22, 2012 on the 90th annual pilgrimage to the shrine over 450 pilgrims attended. Beginning Aug 17, 2002, as a followup to world youth day in Toronto, a one-day Catholic youth rally is held annually. Called Rock the <b>Mount,</b> it <b>draws</b> young people and families from across the prairie provinces.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the North African tirailleur (infantry) units the <b>mounted</b> spahis were <b>drawn</b> from [...] "the big tents": i.e. the higher social classes of the Arab and Berber communities. This dated back {{to the establishment of}} the corps when Colonel Marey-Monge required that each recruit provide his own horse.|$|R
60|$|Mont. Thou art deceived; for whensoe'er I die, The Sun, my father, bears my soul on high: He lets me down a beam, and <b>mounted</b> there, He <b>draws</b> it back, {{and pulls}} {{me through the}} air: I in the eastern parts, and rising sky, You in heaven's downfal, and the west must lie.|$|R
60|$|I silently {{pointed out}} to Bruno {{the best place to}} lead her to, so as to get a view of the whole garden at once: it was a little rising ground, about the height of a potato; and, when they had <b>mounted</b> it, I <b>drew</b> back into the shade, that Sylvie mightn't see me.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the machine}} is <b>mounted</b> on a <b>drawing</b> board with a hard and smooth surface, {{anchored}} to a base that allows its tilting and lifting. Thus, the realization of a drawing can be achieved in the most convenient way on a working surface that can be tilted at any angle from horizontal to vertical.|$|R

50|$|The Camolin Cavalry was a <b>mounted</b> yeomanry unit <b>drawn</b> {{from the}} area around the village of Camolin, Wexford, Ireland. It was a part of this unit, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Bookey, which encountered Father John Murphy's small band of rebels at The Battle of the Harrow in the parish of Kilcormick on the evening of 26 May 1798.|$|R
5000|$|An initial {{plan for}} formal gardens at <b>Mount</b> Cuba was <b>drawn</b> up by Thomas Warren Sears {{when the house}} was built, {{but it was not}} completed. In 1951, Marian Cruger Coffin {{designed}} an eighteenth century-style garden. [...] In the 1960s, the Copelands worked with landscape architect Seth Kelsey in developing a system of ponds, paths, and plants.|$|R
2500|$|Tourism is also {{a strong}} {{industry}} in the state. Much of this is centered on the state's natural features; Oregon's mountains, forests, waterfalls, rivers, beaches and lakes, including Crater Lake National Park, Multnomah Falls, the Painted Hills, the Deschutes River, and the Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve. Mount Hood, and <b>Mount</b> Bachelor also <b>draw</b> visitors year round for skiing and snow activities.|$|R
5000|$|Pugh is {{best known}} for {{undertaking}} the first swim across the North Pole in 2007 to highlight the melting of the Arctic sea ice. In 2010 he swam across a glacial lake on <b>Mount</b> Everest to <b>draw</b> attention to the melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas, and the impact the reduced water supply will have on peace in the region.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{military}} forces {{raised in the}} colony of New South Wales were formed in June 1801, when [...] "loyal associations" [...] formed mainly from free settlers, were established in Sydney and Parramatta in response to concerns about a possible uprising by Irish convicts. Consisting of about 50 men each, and receiving training from non commissioned officers of the New South Wales Corps, these associations are reputed to have been [...] "reasonably efficient". In 1803, {{in light of the}} influx of Irish political exiles a concerned Governor Phillip King, raised the Governor's Body Guard, a <b>mounted</b> unit, <b>drawing</b> its personnel from emancipists [...] and former convicts who had been of excellent behaviour during their sentences.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Eden {{was founded}} in 1850 {{by a group of}} farmers from <b>Mount</b> Eden, Kentucky, <b>drawn</b> to California by the Gold Rush. The party disbanded upon {{reaching}} the San Francisco Bay, but a few settled at a road crossing where they nailed a sign [...] "Mt. Eden" [...] to two trees, and the name stuck. A post office opened in 1860 and was in continuous operation until 1953.|$|R
60|$|Akasha was now {{converted}} into a strong entrenched camp, in which an advanced base was formed. Its garrison of three battalions, a battery, and the <b>mounted</b> troops, <b>drew</b> their supplies by camel transport from Sarras. The country {{to the south and}} east was continually patrolled, to guard against a turning movement, and the communications were further strengthened by the establishment of fortified posts at Semna, Wady Atira, and Tanjore. The friendly Arab tribes--Bedouin, Kabbabish, and Foggara--ranged still more widely in the deserts and occupied the scattered wells. All this time the Dervishes watched supinely from their position at Fuket, and although they were within a single march of Akasha they remained inactive and made no attempt to disturb the operations.|$|R
25|$|Bar, tube, {{and wire}} drawing all work upon the same principle: the {{starting}} stock drawn through a die {{to reduce the}} diameter and increase the length. Usually the die is <b>mounted</b> on a <b>draw</b> bench. The end of the workpiece is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die. The end is then placed in grips {{and the rest of}} the workpiece is pulled through the die. Steels, copper alloys, and aluminium alloys are common materials that are drawn.|$|R
