500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the atmospherics along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, {{at the age}} of 70, after {{repeated}} requests over a period of twenty years Brahmananda accepted the position of Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of Jyotir Math, a position that had been vacant for more than 150 years. His disciple, Swami Karpatri is reported to have been the person who brought the request for Brahmānanda to take the post after a search for a proper candidate was initiated by Dharma Maha Mandal. Brahmananda is reported to have responded to the request by saying: [...] "You want to put a lion to chains who moves about in the jungle freely. But if you so like, I honour your words and am ready to shoulder the responsibilities of the pitha (monastery) management. By shouldering this responsibility, I would be serving the cause for which Adi Shankaracharya stood. I fully dedicate <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mission." ...|$|E

The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.|$|E
