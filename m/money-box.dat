50|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} storage utilized were the rudimentary <b>money-boxes</b> (θΗΣΑΥΡΌΣ) which were made similar in {{form to the}} construction of a bee-hive, and were found for example in the Mycenae tombs of 1550-1500 BC.|$|R
60|$|With {{the money}} {{collected}} at a festa, they usually {{pay for the}} dressing of the church, and for the hiring of the band, and for the tapers. If there be any left (which seldom happens, I believe), the souls in Purgatory get the benefit of it. They are also supposed to {{have the benefit of}} the exertions of certain small boys, who shake <b>money-boxes</b> before some mysterious little buildings like rural turnpikes, which (usually shut up close) fly open on Red-letter days, and disclose an image and some flowers inside.|$|R

"When interest-day came again, China Aster, by {{the utmost}} exertions, could only pay Orchis' agent {{a small part}} of what was due, and a part of that was made up by his children's gift money (bright tenpenny pieces and new quarters, kept in their little <b>money-boxes),</b> and pawning his best clothes, with those of his wife and children, so that all were {{subjected}} to the hardship of staying away from church. And the old usurer, too, now beginning to be obstreperous, China Aster paid him his interest and some other pressing debts with money got by, at last, mortgaging the candlery.|$|R
40|$|The papal appeals reached Poland in all {{important}} matters connected with events or plans {{related to the}} Holy Land. The first call for {{taking part in the}} crusade to Jerusalem was dated from 1095. The next appeals went before the second, third, fifth and bloodless crusades. In {{the second half of the}} 13 -th and in the first half of the 14 -th centuries the papacy called on the Faithful to participate in the intended crusades. They were not usually realized. The popes told the priests to preach in order to encourage Poles to fight not only in Palestine but also elsewhere. They had the same privileges those ones as setting out to Jerusalem. They might fight with Slaves from Polabie, tribes from Prussia and Tatars. They could also help to keep and later to regain the Latin Empire. They might fight against some people: Bolesław the Bald and the antipope Robert. The papacy often demanded money from those one, who wanted to free themselves from the vows of taking part in crusades. There were other ways of helping the Holy Land. The popes imposed tithes and ordered to put money into <b>money-boxes</b> in churches. They claimed sums, which were bequeathed to Palestine. Indirect responses to the papal appeals for help the Holy Land, with money and deed, were donations for the orders originating from there. It was a form of buying oneself out of taking part in the crusades, on the other hand that money was sent to the East and might be used as means in fighting against Saracens. Such fundations were found in Silesia, Great Poland and West Pomerania. The mentions in the historical sources are the arguments that papal call not only were known in medieval Poland but also that the society responed to them. Zadanie pt.

60|$|To post {{a letter}} {{you did not}} merely saunter to the post-office and drop it into the box. The {{cautious}} correspondent first went into the shop and explained to Lizzie how matters stood. She kept what she called a bookseller's shop {{as well as the}} post-office; but the supply of books corresponded exactly to the lack of demand for them, and her chief trade was in nicknacks, from marbles and <b>money-boxes</b> up to concertinas. If he found the postmistress in an amiable mood, which was only now and then, the caller led up craftily to the object of his visit. Having discussed the weather and the potato-disease, he explained that his sister Mary, whom Lizzie would remember, had married a fishmonger in Dundee. The fishmonger had lately started on himself and was doing well. They had four children. The youngest had had a severe attack of measles. No news had been got of Mary for twelve months; and Annie, his other sister, who lived in Thrums, had been at him of late for not writing. So he had written a few lines; and, in fact, he had the letter with him. The letter was then produced, and examined by the postmistress. If the address was in the schoolmaster's handwriting, she professed her inability to read it. Was this a t or an l or an i? was that a b or a d? This was a cruel revenge on Lizzie's part; for the sender of the letter was completely at her mercy. The schoolmaster's name being tabooed in her presence, he was unable to explain that the writing was not his own; and as for deciding between the t's and l's, he could not do it. Eventually he would be directed to put the letter into the box. They would do their best with it, Lizzie said, but in a voice that suggested how little hope she had of her efforts to decipher it proving successful.|$|R

60|$|But {{this time}} I turned rebel, and ignored the royal commands.

60|$|There is sounder {{sleep and}} deeper rest in Mr Dombey's house tonight, than {{there has been}} for many nights. The morning sun awakens the old household, settled down once more in their old ways. The rosy {{children}} opposite run past with hoops. There is a splendid wedding in the church. The juggler's wife is active with the <b>money-box</b> in another quarter of the town. The mason sings and whistles as he chips out P-A-U-L in the marble slab before him.|$|E
6000|$|Tom went first, cutting rude {{steps in}} the clay hill as he descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys {{examined}} three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest {{the base of the}} rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no <b>money-box.</b> The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Sam Jones and Peter Gubbins altered their minds. Sam found a couple o' shillings {{that his wife}} 'ad hidden in her Sunday bonnet, and Peter Gubbins opened 'is boy's <b>money-box</b> to see 'ow much there was in it. They {{came up to the}} Cauliflower to pay Bob their eighteen-pences, but he wasn't there, and when they went to his 'ouse Mrs. Pretty said as 'ow he'd gone off to Wickham and wouldn't be back till Saturday. So they 'ad to spend the money on beer instead.|$|E
60|$|He was {{admitted}} by an elderly male servant to a waiting-room {{on the first}} floor. The light of one little lamp, placed on a bracket fixed to the wall, was so obscured by a dark green shade as to make it difficult, if not impossible, for visitors meeting by accident to recognize each other. The metal <b>money-box</b> fixed to the table was just visible. In the flickering light of a small fire, the stranger perceived the figures of three men seated, apart and silent, who were the only occupants of the room beside himself.|$|E
60|$|So, it {{has come}} to pass that the spring-van is strewing flowers on the rosy hours and on the staircase, and that Twemlow is {{surveying}} the ground on which he is to play his distinguished part to-morrow. He has already been to the church, and taken note of the various impediments in the aisle, under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the pews, and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism, but is in fact voluntarily doubled up to act as a <b>money-box.</b>|$|E
60|$|Indeed, Gavin's {{appearance}} in church without the precentor {{would have been}} as surprising as Tammas's without the minister. As certainly as the shutting of a <b>money-box</b> {{is followed by the}} turning of the key, did the precentor walk stiffly from the vestry to his box a toll of the bell in front of the minister. Tammas's halfpenny rang in the plate as Gavin passed T'nowhead's pew, and Gavin's sixpence with the snapping-to of the precentor's door. The two men might have been connected by a string that tightened at ten yards.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps because Sir W. P. was a {{business}} man, he was less persuasive with his pen than with his tongue. I thought he was merely humouring me, fell into a violent rage, and tore up not only his letter, but--noodle that I was--the Harris Order too--into the tiniest pieces, and heaped them up, like a soufflé, on my tray. Mr Anon's I locked up in my old <b>money-box,</b> with the nightgown and the Miss Austen. Both letters wore like acid into my mind. From that day on--except for a few half-stifled or excited hours--they were never out of remembrance.|$|E
60|$|By {{good fortune}} my <b>money-box</b> {{was not the}} weightiest of my grandfather's French trunks--not the brass-bound friend-in-need of my younger days, and it {{contained}} little but paper. I hoisted it on to my bed, and, as I had lately seen the porters do at the railway station, contrived to push under it and raise it on to my shoulder. Its edge drove in on my collar-bone till I thought it must snap. Thus laden, I staggered cautiously down the staircase, pushed slowly across the room, and, so, out into the passage and towards the rounded and dusky oblong of the open door.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} {{exhausted}} with singing Mr. Hutchins {{would give them}} a short address, generally choosing as his subject a strong, violent-tempered man given to drink and coarse language. The speaker proved conclusively {{that a man who}} drank would do other things in secret, and he pictured this man going home and beating his wife because she reproached him for breaking open the children's <b>money-box</b> to spend the savings on Irish whisky. At every point he made he groaned, and the crew, as soon as they found they might groan too, did so with extraordinary gusto, the boy's groans being weird beyond conception.|$|E
6000|$|Then a {{great idea}} came to him, in a {{paragraph}} called [...] "Lovers' Tokens" [...] that he read in a torn fragment of Tit Bits. It fell in to the measure of his courage--a divided sixpence! He secured his aunt's best scissors, fished a sixpence out of his jejune tin <b>money-box,</b> and jabbed his finger in a varied series of attempts {{to get it in}} half. When they met again the sixpence was still undivided. He had not intended to mention the matter to her at that stage, but it came up spontaneously. He endeavoured to explain the theory of broken sixpences and his unexpected failure to break one.|$|E
60|$|Of course, in practice, {{it works}} out just the other way. People read a review of an author's book and are told that it throbs with a passion so intense as almost to be painful, and are {{on the point of}} digging seven-and-sixpence out of their child's <b>money-box</b> to secure a copy, when their eyes fall on the man's {{photograph}} {{at the side of the}} review, and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears spectacles and a low collar. And this man is the man who is said to have laid bare the soul of a woman as with a scalpel.|$|E
60|$|While I {{was getting}} these facts and opinions, I {{by no means}} {{neglected}} the child. She was not attractive; but fortunately she had reached the corrupt age of seven, when half-a-crown appears about {{as large as a}} saucer and is fully as rare as the dodo. For a shilling down, sixpence in her <b>money-box,</b> and an American gold dollar which I happened to find in my pocket, I bought the creature soul and body. She declared her intention to accompany me {{to the ends of the}} earth; and had to be chidden by her sire for drawing comparisons between myself and her Uncle William, highly damaging to the latter.|$|E
6000|$|So far {{as objects}} {{were to be}} seen, {{there was nothing to}} attract {{attention}} in the waiting-room. The furniture was plain and neat, and nothing more. The elderly servant handed a card, with a number inscribed on it, to the new visitor, said in a whisper, [...] "Your number will be called, sir, in your turn," [...] and disappeared. For some minutes nothing disturbed the deep silence but the faint ticking of a clock. After a while a bell rang from an inner room, a door opened, and a gentleman appeared, whose interview with Doctor Lagarde had terminated. His opinion of the sitting was openly expressed in one emphatic word--"Humbug!" [...] No contribution dropped from his hand as he passed the <b>money-box</b> on his way out.|$|E
60|$|There {{followed}} days {{of excitement}} centred round their <b>money-box.</b> Shovel introduced Tommy {{to a boy}} what said as after a bit you forget how much money was in your box, {{and then when you}} opened it, oh, Lor'! there is more than you thought, so he and Elspeth gave this plan a week's trial, affecting not to know how much they had gathered, but when they unlocked it, the sum was still only eightpence; so then Tommy told the liar to come on, and they fought while the horrified Elspeth prayed, and Tommy licked him, a result due to one of the famous Thrums left-handers then on exhibition in that street for the first time, as taught the victor by Petey Whamond the younger, late of Tillyloss.|$|E
60|$|The monthly {{meetings}} of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a large room, pleasantly and airily situated {{at the top of}} a safe and commodious ladder. The president was the straight-walking Mr. Anthony Humm, a converted fireman, now a schoolmaster, and occasionally an itinerant preacher; and the secretary was Mr. Jonas Mudge, chandler's shopkeeper, an enthusiastic and disinterested vessel, who sold tea to the members. Previous to the commencement of business, the ladies sat upon forms, and drank tea, till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off; and a large wooden <b>money-box</b> was conspicuously placed upon the green baize cloth of the business-table, behind which the secretary stood, and acknowledged, with a gracious smile, every addition to the rich vein of copper which lay concealed within.|$|E
