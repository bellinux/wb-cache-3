40|$|Abstract: Lignocelluloses {{are often}} a major or {{sometimes}} the sole components of different waste streams from various industries, forestry, agriculture and municipalities. Hydrolysis of these materials {{is the first step}} for either digestion to biogas (<b>methane)</b> or <b>fermentation</b> to ethanol. However, enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses with no pretreatment is usually not so effective because of high stability of the materials to enzymatic or bacterial attacks. The present work is dedicated to reviewing the methods that have been studied for pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes for conversion to ethanol or biogas. Effective parameters in pretreatment of lignocelluloses, such as crystallinity, accessible surface area, and protection by lignin and hemicellulose are described first. Then, several pretreatment methods are discussed and their effects on improvement in ethanol and/or biogas production are described. They include milling, irradiation, microwave, steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), supercritical CO 2 and its explosion, alkaline hydrolysis, liquid hot-water pretreatment, organosolv processes, wet oxidation, ozonolysis, dilute- and concentrated-acid hydrolyses, and biological pretreatments...|$|R

Based on the results from experiment one, four EO (clove oil (CLO), cinnamon oil (CNO), white thyme oil (WTO), and anise oil (ANO)) were selected and tested at three different dose levels (125, 250, and 500 mg/L of culture fluid) for their effects on <b>methane</b> production and <b>fermentation</b> in a 24 hr batch culture (experiment two). Methane production was significantly reduced with the four EO at the 500 mg/L dose but at 250 mg/L; only CLO and CNO reduced methane production. The reduction in methane production with the 500 mg/L dose was also associated with reductions in dry matter (DM) digestibility and total volatile fatty acids (VFA). In the third experiment, the effect of CT at 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % of diet DM on methane production was also tested in a 24 hr batch culture. Results from this experiment showed no effect of CT on methane production although methane production tended to be lower at 7. 5 % CT. In conclusion, the reduction in methane production with EO most likely resulted from EO negative effects on DM digestibility and fermentation...|$|R

The method used {{is based on the}} conceptual framework of lifecycle assessment (LCA), but only for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. National average data were used to model the dairy system in each country. Collection of inventory data and calculations of emissions were harmonised to the greatest extent possible for the two systems. The calculated CF for 1 Â kg of energy corrected milk (ECM), including related by-products (surplus calves and culled cows), was 1. 00 Â kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) for NZ and 1. 16 Â kg CO 2 e for SE. <b>Methane</b> from enteric <b>fermentation</b> and nitrous oxide emissions from application of nitrogen (as fertiliser and as excreta dropped directly on the field) were the main contributors to the CF in both countries. The most important parameters to consider when calculating the GHG emissions were dry matter intake (DMI), emission factor (EF) for <b>methane</b> from enteric <b>fermentation,</b> amount of nitrogen applied and EF for direct nitrous oxide emissions from soils. By changing one parameter at a time within 'reasonable' limits (i. e. no extreme values assumed), the impact on the total CF was assessed and showed changes of up to 15 %. In addition, the uncertainty in CF estimates due to uncertainty in EF for <b>methane</b> from enteric <b>fermentation</b> and nitrous oxide emissions (from soil and due to ammonia volatilisation) were analysed through Monte Carlo simulation.
