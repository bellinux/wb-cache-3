5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

Clinical and imaging findings are described. Renal <b>masses</b> <b>that</b> present in a bilateral fashion can have particular clinical and imaging characteristics and knowledge of their presentation enables appropriate diagnosis and management, especially in a multidisciplinary care setting. More commonly found bilateral renal <b>masses</b> <b>that</b> are discussed include metastasis, lymphoproliferative disorders, adult polycystic kidney disease, angiomyolipomas, renal infracts and renal abscesses. Less common bilateral renal masses include transitional cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, and hematomas...|$|R

However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe.

Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale).

In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E

For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E

However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Arlene {{were from a}} cloud <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> {{developed}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean in early May1981. The system crossed Central America, and by the afternoon of May5, a low-level circulation was evident near Roatán, {{off the coast of}} Honduras. Convection was initially disorganized, preventing classification as a tropical cyclone. It was not until late on May6 that Dvorak satellite intensity estimates began on the system. Around that time, it is estimated it became a tropical depression, while located near the Cayman Island. It was a rare example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

The star is located at an estimated 5700 parsecs (18,591 light years) from the Earth. The star is named for the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics group, which saw the star as a gravitational microlensing event in 2009 and combed the data in hope of discovering a planet.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 has a <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> is 1.03 {{times the}} mass of the Sun and a radius that is 1.34 times the Sun's radius.

With this, its {{estimated}} age is 8.5 billion years, over twice the age of the Sun, but this age may vary to any point between 4.4 and 14 billion years in age because of the high uncertainty surrounding this aspect of the star's age.|$|E

5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular <b>Mass.</b> <b>That</b> blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the star's diameter, questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The <b>mass</b> <b>that</b> makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed, and red supergiants are major contributors, yet {{the process by which}} mass is lost remain a mystery. With advances in interferometric methodologies, astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum. In July 2009, images released by the European Southern Observatory, taken by the ground-based Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), showed a vast plume of gas extending 30AU from the star into the surrounding atmosphere. This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse's surrounding atmosphere. Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse. Solving the mystery of mass loss in the late stages of a star's evolution may reveal those factors that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} ways MS is used to {{identify}} proteins.

If a protein sequence in the reference list {{gives rise to a}} significant number of predicted <b>masses</b> <b>that</b> match the experimental values, {{there is some evidence that}} this protein was present in the original sample. Purification steps therefore limit the throughput of the peptide mass fingerprinting approach. Peptide mass fingerprinting can be achieved with MS/MS.|$|R
