40|$|The {{main purpose}} <b>of</b> a <b>logotype</b> is to {{harmonize}} with a company’s business concept and culture. This study {{is based on}} the receiver’s attitudes about three different logotypes - Volvo, Telia and Mcdonald's. It informs the reader about the importance <b>of</b> a <b>logotype</b> as a mean of communication and if the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>logotype</b> harmonize with the profile of the company. The study also discusses whether the visual aspects <b>of</b> a <b>logotype</b> make any difference in this process. This is a qualitative study that has been conducted through interviews and the purpose is to collect and analyze the receiver’s attitudes regarding the <b>logotypes.</b> The theories <b>of</b> this study are based on visual communication, interpretation and semiotics. Our study shows that the receiver’s attitudes against the logotypes are mostly negative, mainly because the receiver’s were unable to understand the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>logotypes.</b> This study also shows that the receiver’s interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>logotypes</b> depended on a specific context and prejudice...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the problem <b>of</b> image-based <b>logotype</b> detection and recognition. A new algorithm for logotype detection in images of cars is proposed. In the first stage, the algorithm localizes all maximally-stable extremal regions as candidates <b>of</b> <b>logotype</b> parts. In the next stage, the regions are combined to create logotype candidates, which are encoded by histograms of gradients. A random forest classifier is {{then used to}} verify the candidate regions as being logotypes or not and simultaneously classify them into the type <b>of</b> the <b>logotype.</b> In addition, improvements to basic algorithm are proposed. The improvements {{include the use of}} alternative color spaces, geometric normalization and use of the car license plate location to form the logotype position prior. An annotated dataset with photographs of vehicles of twenty different makes was prepared for evaluation of the algorithm. The algorithm was able to correctly localize and recognize over 70 % <b>of</b> car <b>logotypes</b> at a very low false positive rate. Despite the fact that we focus on car logotype detection, the algorithm can be easily extended to detection <b>of</b> arbitrary <b>logotypes</b> or objects that do not violate assumptions we impose on the logotype appearance...|$|R

An analysis of quantitative descriptive research from 291 Vanderbilt University undergraduate students shows that adding the <b>logotype</b> <b>of</b> a premium brand can increase the perceived value of a product compared to the unbranded version while adding a budget brand’s logotype can either increase or decrease the perceived value of the unbranded version. These findings illustrate the importance of determining the perceived value of a brand and developing strategies to increase positive brand perception among consumers {{even if that means}} disassociating the product from its brand name. This is the only research to date examining the impact <b>of</b> a <b>logotype</b> on the perceived market value of consumer goods...|$|R

Whereas previous works were restricted to the recognition of a few tens <b>of</b> <b>logotypes,</b> we generalize the problem to the recognition of thousands of legal persons, each being modeled by a rich corporate identity automatically built from web images. We intro-duce a new geometrically-consistent instance-based classifi-cation method that is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on several challenging datasets while being much more scalable. Further experiments performed on an au-tomatic web crawl of 5, 824 legal entities demonstrates the scalability of the approach...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a social {{semiotic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>logotypes</b> used to brand cultural festivals in 21 st century Australia. A contemporary method is explored that suits the significant role typography performs {{within this context}} and offers a contribution to design research and the festival scape that not only engages with the artefacts of design but with the conceptualization of designed meaning in visual culture. Branding is {{a vital part of}} the festival space and relies on typography to establish the symbolic values and representations of urban freedoms; rich histories, cultured places, playfulness and stimulation that seek to subvert our daily existence while performing the task of engaging local, national, and international visitors and participants. However, professional practices demonstrated in the design, media and arts industries have far outpaced the extent to which this phenomenon has been written about in the academic or public realm. This paper addresses this shortfall and offers the foundation for a systemic functional method in the decoding of typography in visual cultur...|$|R
