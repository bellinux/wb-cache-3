Finally, the effect of external constraints was analyzed (full model vs. diaphyseal fixation and reduced number of muscle loads). Relatively large <b>micromotions</b> were found during the swing phase when the hip joint forces were relatively low. Maximal <b>micromotions,</b> however, did concur with the peak hip joint force.

50|$|Cortical {{implants}} have a {{wide variety}} of potential uses, ranging from restoring vision to blind patients or helping patients suffering from dementia. With the complexity of the brain, the possibilities for these brain implants to expand their usefulness are nearly endless. Some early work in cortical implants involved stimulation of the visual cortex, using implants made from silicone rubber. Since then, implants have developed into more complex devices using new polymers, such as polyimide. There are two ways that cortical implants can interface with the brain, either intracortically (direct) or epicortically (indirect). Intracortical implants have electrodes that penetrate into the brain, while epicortical implants have electrodes that stimulate along the surface. Epicortical implants mainly record field potentials around them and are generally more flexible compared to their intracortical counterparts. Since the intracortical implants go deeper into the brain, they require a stiffer electrode. However, due to <b>micromotion</b> in the brain, some flexibility is necessary in order to prevent injury to the brain tissue.|$|E

Rotator cuff disease is a common problem in candidates for total shoulder arthroplasty; this study relates the functional status of the rotator cuff to the initial stability of a cementless glenoid implant. A 3 D finite element model of a complete scapula was used to quantify the effect of a dysfunctional rotator cuff in terms of bone-implant interface <b>micromotions</b> when the implant is physiologically loaded shortly after surgery. Four rotator cuff conditions (from fully intact to progressively ruptured rotator cuff tendons) as well as two bone qualities were simulated in a model. <b>Micromotions</b> were significantly larger in the worst modeled cuff dysfunction (i. e. the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were fully dysfunctional). <b>Micromotions</b> were also significantly different between conditions with healthy and poor bone quality. The implant's initial stability was hardly influenced by a dysfunctional supraspinatus alone. However, when the infraspinatus was also affected, the glenohumeral joint force was displaced to the component's rim resulting in larger <b>micromotions</b> and instability of the implant...|$|R

A force controlled experiment was performed in which a metal backed glenoid component with various PE inlay radii was subjected to a simulated joint reaction force. Local interface <b>micromotions,</b> rim displacement and bone substitute deformation were measured using DVRT sensors. All measured variables were significantly larger (p< 0. 05) in the non-conform inlay with radial mismatch 6 mm, compared to the conform inlay. These findings are contrary to previous reports by other authors who found that a larger mismatch not only reduces interface <b>micromotions</b> but translational forces and bone strains as well. The reason for these contradicting findings is the fact that in the present study a force controlled experiment was performed as opposed to a displacement controlled experiment. A non-conform inlay allows for a larger humeral head translation in the inlay. This causes a larger resultant moment on the metal back that opens the bone-implant interface.

An automatic data processor coupled to a three-dimensional mesh generator is designed to extract cortical bone geometry and inhomogeneous distribution of trabecular bone density from data obtained with quantitative computed tomography (QCT).

40|$|Objective. Qualitative {{comparison}} of the initial stability provided by two joint preparation techniques and various screw configurations in ankle arthrodesis, using the finite element method. Design. A three-dimensional model of a healthy ankle was developed from computed tomography images. Two groups of models were built, one with the joint contours resected to produce flat surfaces, and the second with the joint contours preserved. In each case, a variety of screw orientations were examined. Background. Despite the improved results of ankle arthrodesis, failure rates due to non-union are still reported. The initial stability of the arthrodesis construct seems important in the final outcome of the fusion. Methods. Non-linear contact finite element analyses were performed in the arthrodesis constructs subjected to internal/external torsion and dorsiflexion. <b>Micromotions</b> at the bone-to-bone interface were calculated for frictionless and Coulomb friction contact, and compared for the two joint preparation techniques and screw configurations. Results. Overall lower peak <b>micromotions</b> were predicted when preserving the joint contours both in torsion and dorsiflexion. For both preparation techniques, the lowest <b>micromotions</b> tended to occur with the screws inserted at 30 ° {{with respect to the}} long axis of the tibia, crossing above the fusion site. Inclusion of friction in the models caused a general decrease on the magnitude of the <b>micromotions</b> as compared to the frictionless case, but did not affect the ranking of the models. Conclusions. The finite element method {{can be used as a}} qualitative tool to study the initial stability of ankle arthrodesis, overcoming the difficulties of measuring bone-to-bone interface <b>micromotions</b> experimentally. Better initial stability was predicted for ankle arthrodesis when the joint contours were preserved rather than resected. Crossing the screws above the fusion site at a steeper angle also tended to increase the stability at the fusion site. Relevance Finite element analyses can help during the pre-operative planning of ankle arthrodesis. When bone density is not compromised, preserving the joint contour and inserting the screws at less than 45 ° to the long axis of the tibia, crossing over the arthrodesis site, may offer better initial stability. <br/...|$|R

This is equivalent to studying the effect of the <b>micromotion</b> since this motion must be neglected for the trapped ion to be considered as a harmonic oscillator. By applying the transformation of Cook and Shankland we find that the <b>micromotion</b> can be represented by two periodically oscillating operators. In order to investigate the effect of the <b>micromotion</b> on the dynamics of a trapped atom-ion system, we calculate (i) the coupling strengths of the <b>micromotion</b> operators by numerical integration and (ii) the quasienergies of the system by applying the Floquet formalism, a useful framework for studying periodic systems.

Finite element models of ankle arthrodesis were developed from computed tomography images. Two-screw constructs were augmented with a third screw in different orientations and Subjected to loads likely to affect the ankle postoperatively. Background More stable fixation seems to increase the chance of fusion, as it minimises the motion between the tibiotalar interfaces. Methods. Non-linear elastic finite element analyses were performed in external torsion and dorsiflexion. The <b>micromotions</b> at the tibiotalar interface were computed to compare the two- and three-screw fixation in intact and flat-cut arthrodesis. Results. Adding a third screw reduced the <b>micromotions</b> at the fusion site. Inserting the third screw anteriorly predicted lower peak <b>micromotions</b> than inserting the screw posteriorly, except for the intact arthrodesis tested in dorsiflexion. Three-screw intact arthrodesis predicted lower peak <b>micromotions</b> than flat-cut arthrodesis. Conclusions. Better stability was predicted for three-screw ankle arthrodesis. In flat-cut arthrodesis, a third screw inserted anteriorly performed better than a posterior screw. In intact arthrodesis, a posterior screw seemed a better option when flexion stability was the main concern. Even with three-screw fixation, {{the configuration of the}} first two-crossed screws may still be important to improve the stability at the fusion site.

40|$|Highlights - CoCr graded femoral stems attain reduced bone-stress shielding, stability, and bone-equivalent stiffness, {{in silico}} and in vitro. - Reversed AGS model failed {{balanced}} bone-implant <b>micromotions</b> on promoting bone osseointegration. - Dense RGS, hollow RGS, and proximal AGS increased Gruen zone 7 stress values by 3 − 4. 7 {{times that of}} Ti stems. - Proximal AGS and hollow RGS are highlighted to be adopted for an innovative load-sharing femoral stems. Abstract The incapability of controlling relative <b>micromotions</b> and load transfers to a peri-prosthetic femur shortens implant longevity. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of applying graded porous cobalt chromium (CoCr) to cementless femoral stems. 3 D finite element analyses and physical testings of hip implants were conducted with four different grading orientations, along the axial and radial planes of the femoral stem. The {{results show that the}} CoCr graded femoral stems with a porosity decreased caudally and inwardly may control the relative <b>micromotions</b> in an acceptable range for bone ingrowth, significantly increase stress transfers on the Gruen zone 1 and 7, and attain the flexural stiffness comparable to human femurs. Therefore, CoCr graded femoral stems demonstrate great potential for applications in implants with reduced stress shielding and improved long-term survival rates...|$|R
40|$|Revision total knee arthoplasty often {{requires}} modular implants to treat bone defects of varying severity. In some cases, {{it may not}} be clear which module size and implant combination (e. g. sleeve and stem) should be chosen for a specific defect. When balancing implant stability and osseointegration against stress-shielding, it is important to choose an appropriate implant combination in order to match the given level of bone loss. Therefore, the necessity of stems in less extensive tibial defects and the advantage of different stems (lengths and stiffnesses) in combination with large metaphyseal sleeves on implant fixation and bone flexibility using a modular tibial revision knee system, were analyzed. Four different stem combinations for a tibial revision implant (Sigma TC 3, DePuy) were compared to an intact bone. Standardized implantation with n = 4 synthetic tibial bones was performed after generating an Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI) Type T 1 bone defect. Axial torques around the longitudinal stem axis and varus-valgus torques were separately applied to the implant. <b>Micromotions</b> of bone and implant were tracked using a digital image correlation system to calculate relative <b>micromotions</b> at the implant-bone-interface and bone deformation. Overall, using stems reduced the proximal <b>micromotions</b> of tray and sleeve compared to no stem, while reducing bone deformation proximally at the same time, indicating some potential for proximal stress-shielding compared to no stem. The potential for increased proximal stress-shield due to reduced proximal deformation appeared to be greater when using the longer stems. The location of lowest relative <b>micromotions</b> was also more distal when using long stems as opposed to short stems. A short stem (especially a smaller diameter short stem which still achieves diaphyseal fixation) displayed less potential for stress-shielding, but greater bone deformation distal to the tip of the stem than in the natural model. In the case of tibial revision implants with metaphyseal sleeves in a simple fully contained Type I defect, the absence of a stem provides for more natural bone deformation. However, adding a stem reduces overall relative <b>micromotions,</b> while introducing some risk of proximal stress-shielding due to increased diaphyseal fixation. Increasing stem length intensifies this effect. Short stems offered a balance between reduced <b>micromotions</b> and more proximal bone deformation that reduced the potential for stress-shielding when compared to long stems. A short stem with slightly smaller diameter (simulating a less stiff stem which still has diaphyseal fixation) increased the proximal bone deformation, but also tended to increase the bone deformation even further at the distal stem's tip. In conclusion, further investigation should be conducted on fully contained Type I defects and the addition of a stem to offer better initial stability, taking into account stem length (i. e. shorter or more flexible stems) to support metaphyseal fixation and allowing bending found in intact bone. In addition, further study into more extensive tibial defects is required to determine if the stability/micromotion trends observed in this study with stems and sleeves in Type I defects still apply in cases of extensive proximal bone loss...|$|R
