40|$|A double-retention {{redundant}} {{pull pin}} release system is disclosed. The system responds {{to a single}} pull during an intentional release operation. A spiral-threaded <b>main</b> <b>pin</b> is seated in a mating bore in a housing, which <b>main</b> <b>pin</b> has a flange fastened thereon at {{the part of the}} <b>main</b> <b>pin</b> which is exterior to the housing. Accidental release tends to rotate the <b>main</b> <b>pin.</b> A secondary pin passes through a slightly oversized opening in the flange and is seated in a second bore in the housing. The pins counteract against one another to prevent accidental release. A frictional lock is shared between the main and secondary pins to enhance further locking of the system. The secondary pin, in response to a first pull, is fully retracted from its bore and flange hole. Thereafter the pull causes the <b>main</b> <b>pin</b> to rotate free of the housing to release, for example, a parachute mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the pins from Bunge church, in order to {{investigate}} how what they {{can tell us about}} the burials inside the church. During the post medieval and early modern period pins were used to fasten the burial shrouds, and to stabilize the fabric {{on the inside of the}} coffin lids. Therefore these pins appear in grave contexts, and thus offer possibilities for interpretation of burials. The pins have been ordered according to the shape of the needlehead. A total of 697 pins have been analysed, amongst which four <b>main</b> <b>pin</b> types have been detected. The next step in the study was a chorological study where the pins positions were analysed in comparison to other finds such as craniums and coffin handles.

40|$|Certain {{impurity}} species {{trapped in}} the grain boundaries of HY 80 steel during the post-fabrication heat treatment are known to cause temper embrittlement [1]. On the other hand, the local residual stress fields due to lattice mismatch at grain boundaries are the <b>main</b> <b>pinning</b> sites causing irreversible magnetic domain wall motion that creates magnetoacoustic emission (MAE). The peak amplitude of MAE depends on two major factors; the waveform of applied AC magnetic field {{and the strength of}} the 90 ° domain wall-defect interaction which creates an effective potential barrier against the domain wall motion. As the degree of embrittlement increases, therefore, the peak amplitude of MAE burst should increase since the higher concentration of impurities enhances the 90 ° wall-defect interaction at the grain boundaries...|$|R

Even though the post-annealing and quenching process enhances the superconducting volume fraction, it has a minor effect on the upper critical fields for H//c and H//ab. Analysis of the angular-dependence of resistivity rho_ab(theta,H) indicates that it follows the scaling law based on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory and the anisotropy Gamma(T) increases with decreasing temperature with Gamma(T) ~ 3. 6 at 27 K. The resistivity of quenched sample exhibits an Arrhenius TAFF behavior for both field directions.

INTRODUCTION Considerable effort has gone into the study of flux creep in high-temperature superconductors, which show many unexpected features.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Nb(3) Sn superconductors many efforts have been expended to improve the transport properties in these materials. In this work, the heat treatment profiles for Nb(3) Sn superconductor wires with Cu(Sn) artificial pinning centers (APCs) with nanometric-scale sizes were analyzed {{in an attempt to}} improve the critical current densities and upper critical magnetic field. The methodology to optimize the heat treatment profiles in respect to the diffusion, reaction and formation of the superconducting phases is described. Microstructural characterization, transport and magnetic measurements were performed in an attempt to relate the microstructure to the pinning mechanisms acting in the samples. It was concluded that the maximum current densities occur due to normal phases (APCs) that act as the <b>main</b> <b>pinning</b> centers in the global behavior of the Nb(3) Sn superconducting wire.

40|$|Nb(3) Sn {{is one of}} {{the most}} used superconducting {{materials}} for applications in high magnetic fields. The improvement of the critical current densities (J(c)) is important, and must be analyzed together with the optimization of the flux pinning acting in the material. For Nb(3) Sn, it is known that the grain boundaries are the most effective pinning centers. However, the introduction of artificial pinning centers (APCs) with different superconducting properties has been proved to be beneficial for J(c). As these APCs are normally in the nanometric-scale, the conventional heat treatment profiles used for Nb(3) Sn wires cannot be directly applied, leading to excessive grain growth and/or increase of the APCs cross sections. In this work, the heat treatment profiles for Nb(3) Sn superconductor wires with Cu(Sn) artificial pinning centers in nanometric-scale were analyzed in an attempt to improve J(c). It is described a methodology to optimize the heat treatment profiles in respect to diffusion, reaction and formation of the superconducting phases. Microstructural, transport and magnetic characterization were performed in an attempt to find the pinning mechanisms acting in the samples. It was concluded that the maximum current densities were found when normal phases (due to the introduction of the APCs) are acting as <b>main</b> <b>pinning</b> centers in the global behavior of the Nb(3) Sn superconducting wire.

40|$|The thin slab direct {{charging}} process (TSDC) {{as applied to}} microalloyed steels has had a considerable development due to its relatively low production costs and ability to produce steels with good mechanical and toughness properties, comparable to those manufactured by the conventional cold {{charging process}} (CCC). This research {{is concerned with the}} effect of equalisation time on the microstructures. Three equalisation times (53 min, 318 min, and 1 333 min) at 1 150 °C were investigated for a vanadium microalloyed steel, which contained a low carbon content (0. 073 wt%) and a high nitrogen content (0. 021 wt%). The experimental results show that MnS precipitates provided the <b>main</b> <b>pinning</b> forces during casting due to the high solubility temperature, but MnS particles did not provide a sufficient pinning force to prevent the austenite grains from growing. The austenite grain growth appears more likely to be abnormal in this stage. AlN precipitates were only identified at the longest equalisation time due to a low precipitation rate. The AlN pinning effect was evident at 1 333 min equalisation time, and was able to prevent further austenite grain growth by providing an additional pinning force. The study shows that vanadium does not have any effect on austenite grain growth at 1 150 °C because of its low solubility temperature in austenite. When the steel was water-quenched, vanadium remained supersaturated in the solution but tempering in the ferrite phase field (650 °C) can promote VN or VCN precipitation often using AlN as the nuclei...|$|R
