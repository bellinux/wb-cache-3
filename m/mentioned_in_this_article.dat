25|$|On May 21, 2001, the National Assembly of France {{passed the}} Taubira law, {{recognizing}} slavery {{as a crime}} against humanity. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed {{with a high degree}} of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals. Indeed, as already <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> slavery persists in several areas of West Africa until the present day.|$|E
25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> {{may or may not}} necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E

25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
