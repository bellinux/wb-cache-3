5000|$|After {{reading an}} article by the Dutchman Christiaan Eijkman that {{indicated}} that persons who ate brown rice were less vulnerable to beri-beri than those who ate only the fully <b>milled</b> <b>product,</b> Funk tried to isolate the substance responsible, and he succeeded.

In 1911 he published his first paper in English, on dihydroxyphenylalanine. Funk was sure that more than one substance like Vitamin B1 existed, and in his 1912 article for the Journal of State Medicine, he proposed the existence of at least four vitamins: one preventing beriberi (“antiberiberi”); one preventing scurvy (“antiscorbutic”); one preventing pellagra (“antipellagric”); and one preventing rickets (“antirachitic”). From there, Funk published a book, The Vitamines, in 1912, and later that year received a Beit Fellowship to continue his research.|$|E

As-milled and heat treated products were characterised using techniques of combustion analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), selected area electron diffracton (SAED) and high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM). Both the mechanisms of hydrogen uptake and of hydrogen evolution during subsequent heat treatment {{were found to be}} dependent on the mode of milling. Samples milled under a ball-particle impact mode absorbed more hydrogen (2. 7 wt%) than the samples milled under shearing mode, but the fraction of hydrogen released during subsequent low temperature heat treatment (220 - 500 ºC) was significantly less than for the samples milled under shear. XRD of the shear <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> showed increased, but varying c-axis lattice parameters while XRD of the impact <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> showed complete loss of (002) graphite and formation of peaks which could be associated with CnHx species. Low temperature heat treatment of the shear <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> resulted in significant disorder in the graphite structure, characterised by a loss of diffraction peak contrast and high background scattering in both XRD and selected area electron diffraction patterns. In contrast there was little change in XRD patterns from impact milled samples during low temperature heat treatment. For the shear milled samples which were heat treated for short times there was also an associated loss of contrast from graphene layers in HRTEM images, however, HRTEM contrast from samples shear milled and heat treated for longer times showed an increased fraction of graphene sheets in the product. It was concluded that hydrogen uptake under impact mode milling was predominately via an irreversible mechanism involving destruction of graphene sheets and reaction to from product including CnHx -type molecules.

40|$|With {{increasing}} use {{of biomass}} in pulverized fuel coal fired power stations, the impact of mill type on biomass size and shape is fundamental in optimizing mill and burner performance. The impact of mill type on the energy consumption, particle size and particle shape of four different biomasses commonly combusted in pulverized fuel boilers was investigated in this paper. Miscanthus, mixed wood, and steam exploded pellets, along with powdered olive cake, were comminuted in a planetary ball mill, Bond ball mill and cutting mill. For pelletized miscanthus, milling showed little impact on the particle {{size and shape of}} the pellets, with the milling action only reducing the pellets back to their original particle size distribution. This was also observed for the steam exploded pellets and mixed wood pellets in the cutting mill. For non-densified biomasses, such as olive cake, fines below the screen size should be removed before milling in a hammer mill as they pass straight through the mill, resulting in wasted mill capacity and energy consumption. Pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size for conveyance and combustions, and sphericity and roundness are crucial in determining this size. Olive cake showed the most spherical and round particles, but a coarser <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> size than the steam exploded pellets. Miscanthus and mixed wood pellets showed needle like shape profiles, as well as similar particle size distributions.

To overcome extremely low water solubility and associated poor bioavailability they can be formulated as nanosuspensions. This paper is not only focuses on production of parenteral nevirapine nanosuspensions but also on scaling up of formulations for clinical use. Lab scale (APV LAB 40, 40 mL) and medium scale (Avestin C 50, 2 kg) production was performed using piston gap high pressure homogenization (HPH), while the feasibility for pilot scale up was checked using a bead milling technique in continuous mode (PM, Bühler PML- 2). Nanosuspension was characterized for particle sizes, zeta potential, crystallanity and stability. The mean particle sizes for lab scale, medium scale and pilot scale production obtained were 481 nm, 429 nm and 211 nm, respectively. Independent of the production method (lab and pilot scale) all processed formulations showed more or less similar zeta potential (~ 15 mV) in conductivity adjusted water. Long term stability over 1 year showed significant increase in particle size at all storage conditions for lab scale and medium scale production (high energy size reduction) whereas they remained physically stable (with negligible increase) for the <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> (low energy size reduction).

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 In {{a typical}} gold-recovery plant, it is {{estimated}} that a substantial amount of the gold in residues may be in the form that is recoverable by cyanidation. The gold in residues can be ascribed broadly to (l) the presence of cyanicides, which consume the cyanide radical and thus inhibit dissolution of gold, (2) refractory gold resulting from coatings on some gold particles, (3) large gold particles incompletely dissolved due to inadequate contact time, (4) unliberated gold as a result of too coarse a <b>milled</b> <b>product,</b> and (5) gold dissolved during leaching, then adsorbed by other minerals or by carbonaceous matter in the pulp. This study focuses on the latter, where dissolved gold is pregrobbed during leaching by adsorbent materials in the ore. The term pregrobbing refers to the active adsorption ofgold from cyanide pregnant solutions by components ofthe ore. It has been suggested that gold already dissolved by cyanide may be adsorbed by other minerals and by carbonaceous matter in the pulp. The presence ofcarbonaceous matter in gold ores presents a two-fold problem namely, the poor release of gold from the carbonaceous matrix and the uptake of dissolved gold by the carbonaceous leach residues. Studies by several other investigators using ores from various parts of the world have similarly shown that the natural carbonaceous matter associated with refractory gold ores often behaves like activated carbon when in contact with aurocyanide solutions. Some debate also exists over the extent to which gold may be adsorbed onto the surfaces of minerals. Different authors have identified that minerals such as' pyrite, copper sulphides, quartz and layered silicates, such as kaolin, phlogopite and ilIite exhibit gold adsorbing properties. Activated carbon was first used as a model pregrobber in batch kinetic adsorption experiments {{in the presence of a}} gold selective strong base anion-exchange resin...|$|E
40|$|Wheat milling is {{a complex}} process, in terms of plant layout, {{interactions}} between processing units and high variability of feed materials. Despite the rapidly increasing diffusion of analytical instruments to characterize important wheat and flour properties (e. g., near-infrared spectrometers and image analysis sensors), current wheat milling processes are still poorly instrumented. Therefore, process operation is mostly based on the operators’ experience, {{and in most cases}} even the design of the process is based on experience only. On the other hand, severe quality requirements are usually set on the final product. The development of science-driven (as opposed to experience-driven) tools to support process understanding, design and operation can be very beneficial for those industries that require wheat milling as a part of their manufacturing process. Intelligent manufacturing through digitalization is a trend in current manufacturing systems. This Dissertation moves along this trend by proposing an integrated, model-based approach to the optimization of wheat milling processes. In particular, two complementary approaches are investigated: development of data-driven models for single processing units, and simulation of entire milling processes. The models of single units are used to tackle different issues that arise in the wheat milling operation: i) wheat classification, ii) process understanding, iii) prediction of product quality and iv) process design and scale-up. Regarding wheat classification, a methodology based on the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) spectra in combination with latent variable modeling is developed. The objective is checking the ability of NIR spectra to discriminate different wheat varieties, an important aspect of the wheat milling operation, given the high intrinsic variability showed by natural products as wheat. Wheat milling {{is a complex}} process which needs profound understanding to be operated in a satisfactory way. The analysis of the model parameters allows for a better comprehension of the breakage mechanism occurring in wheat milling, thus improving process understanding. The effect of the most influential process parameters and of the wheat properties onto the <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> characteristics is studied for different “passages” (i. e., combinations of processing units) of the process. Expensive and time-consuming experiments can be partly avoided exploiting the predictive ability of data-driven models, which can be used to predict the product quality (i. e., the particle size distribution or the mass fraction of the milled or sieved material), thus supporting the operators in process operation. In this Dissertation, data-driven models are used to predict the product quality both for roller mills and for plansifters. The problem of process design is related to the estimation of the process parameters to be used to obtain a product with a desired characteristic. Data-driven models provide a useful tool to this purpose, through the implementation of appropriate model inversion techniques. In this Dissertation, a latent variable model inversion methodology, that relies on an optimization framework and on data coming from different plant scales, is developed. The framework aims at suggesting the optimal process parameters to be used to obtain a product with desired properties, with the ultimate scope of accelerating the scale-up from the laboratory to the commercial plant. The development of a platform for the simulation of the whole milling process is started in this Dissertation. Due to the complexity of the wheat milling operation, the process is still open to optimization, in terms of both layout and power consumption. The objective is developing a simulator of the whole milling process, that aims at modeling the pneumatic transport, pressure drops and power consumption. This tool can be used to get a better comprehension of the energy consumed throughout the mill and to optimize the process layout, minimizing the overall power consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} to perform {{this study was}} to generate the fundamentals to use oats for bread-making applications. This will offer consumers a healthier alternative product to wheat bread in their daily diet, because oat foods, especially through their high amount of soluble fibre (notably beta-glucans) contribute to the reduction of blood cholesterol levels and of blood glucose rise after the meal. Oats also have a high content of (poly-) unsaturated fatty acids that contribute to maintaining normal blood cholesterol levels. One specific target group that would benefit from the development of good quality oat bread are people with celiac disease (CD). Oats is widely consumed by them, even though its safety has been subject of some debate for a long time. Two peptides from oat avenins can be recognized as T cell epitopes by few CD patients, and differential signals of gluten-specific monoclonal antibodies and in-vitro T cells to oat varieties have suggested the existence of differences in immunogenicity. These health and food safety issues have been addressed in the General Introduction. Bread is consumed all over the world. So far, production of large-volume bread is only possible with wheat. The quality of existing oat bread is below to what consumers are used to with wheat bread. This is partly {{due to the lack of}} knowledge regarding the functionality of oats for other purposes than porridge and breakfast cereals, which are the most common applications. These applications do not represent a big technological challenge as bread does, because bread-making requires a system able to hold gas during proving and baking. In wheat, this is conferred by gluten proteins that form a viscoelastic network with the capacity to expand and to maintain itself after expansion. Oats lack gluten proteins with network-forming capacity. Current oat bread applications rely on batter systems and on the use of additives to increase viscosity for stabilization of gas cells. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part concerns the safety of oats for people with celiac disease (Chapter 2). This was studied by cloning and sequencing avenin genes from 13 Avena species with combinations of the three genomes (A, C, D) that are also present in the hexaploid cultivated A. sativa. We identified up to 10 avenin genes in a single hexaploid oat plant. Avenin proteins clustered in four groups of which two contained the two avenin CD epitopes. All Avena species examined harbored avenins of these two groups, so it is unlikely to find oat cultivars that are devoid of the avenin CD epitopes. None of the internationally agreed gluten CD epitopes from wheat, rye and barley were found to be present in oat avenins. Some epitope variants with two and three amino acid substitutions occurred, but they were predicted to not resist proteolysis in the gastro-intestinal tract and will therefore not be of clinical relevance. Perfect recognition sites of antibodies R 5 and G 12 (which are used in commercial gluten detection kits) were also not present in avenins. Thus, monoclonal antibody signals to oat are probably due to cross-reactivity or promiscuous recognition of avenin peptides, and such signals should not be interpreted as differences in immunogenicity of oat varieties for CD patients. The second part of this thesis focussed on the study of the technological properties of oats. Oats have been used as an addition to wheat-based dough or in an oat-based batter system. However, while for wheat the dough-making parameters necessary to obtain good quality bread have been defined through a long history of research, this is not the case for oats. To fill this gap, this thesis studied the technological properties of oats using a systematic approach. First, we developed a dough testing system that allowed us to assess the dough-making properties of oat flour in a standardized way (Chapter 3). For this we used wheat as a model. We reproduced various quality profiles of wheat flour using combinations of oat flour and vital gluten. Then, we selected a dough system made of 87. 2 % oat flour and 12. 8 % gluten as our standard dough test system. This dough system was sensitive to differences among oat cultivars. Thus, having developed a tool that could detect differences regarding dough-making properties among oat cultivars, the next step was to try to explain those differences in terms of compositional factors. We decided to start our exploration with beta-glucans, because these fibres are one of the oat components that attract interest because of their health benefits. We studied the impact of beta-glucans on dough rheology (Chapter 4) following two strategies: (i) using the developed standard dough system containing gluten; and (ii) by removing the gluten from the system and replacing these proteins by alternative network-forming compounds. In both systems, beta-glucans affected dough rheology. Increasing their concentration resulted in an increase of dough stiffness and in a reduction of dough extensibility. Beta-glucans negatively influenced the elastic properties that additional wheat gluten conferred to oat dough. Low beta-glucan (< 2 %) oat flour had better extensibility properties than oat meal dough or oat flour dough enriched with beta-glucans. The effect was governed by its concentration and its molecular weight (which determines viscosity). Medium-viscosity beta-glucans had a less negative impact than high-viscosity (high molecular weight) beta-glucans. Overall, our findings indicate that beta-glucans are a key component determining rheology of oat-based dough systems. Chapter 5 addressed the effect of particle size distribution on dough-making properties. We found that oat meal is not the best material for bread-applications because it produces a very stiff and short dough. Re-milling did not change this pattern. In contrast, complete removal of the bran from the oat meal did improve dough-making properties, which indicated that dough rheology was negatively impacted by the bran. Large and medium size bran particles were more harmful than fine bran particles. Large and medium bran contained 8 % beta-glucans, while fine bran contained 1. 6 % only. We concluded that oat meal is not appropriate for bread applications. Fractionation of the <b>milled</b> <b>product</b> is an interesting alternative to produce low-beta-glucan flour for bread-making purposes, and the bran can be used to enrich other food products with beta-glucans. This chapter also addressed whether kilning and milling methods applied to oat grains could affect bread-making purposes. Infrared (IR) and steam kilning both affected dough-making properties of oat grains in the standard dough system. The effect of steam kilning was on water absorption only. Non-kilned and steam-kilned grains showed similar extensibility behavior. In contrast, IR kilning affected water absorption and harmed completely the dough extensibility properties of oat grains. Flour from IR kilned grains made a very stiff and short dough. Thus, IR kilning is definitely not suitable for bread applications. Finally, in Chapter 6, we addressed the need for good quality gluten-free oat bread. As further research is required for better understanding of the oat dough system, we studied the rheological properties of oat flour relevant for leavening with gluten alternatives. Whey protein particles (WPP) had appeared to be successful in enhancing viscoelastic properties of wheat starch dough, allowing loaves with specific volumes of ca 3. 7 mL/g. We studied whether WPP could have a similar positive effect on oat flour dough. WPP increased the resistance to extension and the gas retention capacity of oat flour dough. However, in our small scale baking experiments, WPP did not increase loaf specific volume and had a negative effect on gas production. On the other hand, WPP improved crumb texture. WPP are promising as a structuring agent in oat dough, but the process should be further optimized. In the General Discussion we pay attention to the food safety issue of oats for people with coeliac disease. Our analysis across the genus Avena of avenin genes and proteins produced an important new and supporting argument to the safety of oats, as they appeared to contain none of the generally agreed celiac disease-related gluten epitopes from wheat, barley and rye. With this analysis we also could explain the positive signals for the presence of gluten (as described in the literature for several oat varieties on the basis of the R 5 and the G 12 antibody assay and on T cell tests) as being the result of cross-reactivity or promiscuity, without having clinical relevance. The data in this thesis therefore support the advice to gradually introduce the consumption of oats into the daily diet of people with coeliac disease. Further, we discuss the results and the consequences of our technological research on oat flour dough. It appeared that beta-glucans have a serious negative effect on the rheology of the oat dough, which indicates the need for further research on improvement of the balance between optimum application of beta-glucans for health (high amounts and of high molecular weight is better) and for baking quality (low amounts and of low molecular weight is better). Also the pre-treatment of oat flour (notably kilning and milling) and the application of whey protein particles to replace gluten require further optimization. Here the developed standard oat flour dough model system will be a useful tool...|$|E

The four diets contained 54. 3 % forage (alfalfa:corn silages, 1 : 1 DM basis) with the wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> replacing 0, 50, 75, or 100 % of the concentrate portion (corn and soybean meal) of the diet (DM basis). The diets containing wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> resulted in 7. 8 % lower DM intake, equivalent milk production (28. 5 kg/ d), and 13. 6 % greater efficiency of 4 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) production than the control diet. There was no effect of diet on ruminal pH. In experiment 2, 16 Holstein cows were assigned to one of four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The 100 % concentrate replacement diet from experiment 1 was used as control diet. For the test diets, forage was replaced with 15, 30, or 45 % of the corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (DM basis). Efficiency of FCM production (1. 16) was not affected by diet. Rumination time was reduced for the 30 and 45 % forage replacement diets, but ruminal pH was unaffected. In experiment 3, 30 Holstein cows were assigned at parturition to either a control diet (no corn <b>milling</b> <b>product)</b> or a diet containing 40 % corn milling feed in place of both forage and concentrate (optimal levels from experiments 1 and 2) for 9 wk. The diet containing corn milling feed resulted in 21 % greater efficiency of FCM production than the control diet. These results indicate that a new feed product based on wet corn milling ingredients has the potential to effectively replace all of the concentrate and up to 45 % of the forage in the diet for lactating dairy cows...|$|R
