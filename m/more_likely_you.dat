2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would {{have a much better}} shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E

"Well, sir, {{as you say}} he is in funds at present, we {{will this}} evening visit a tavern or two, frequented by young blades, {{some of whom have}} more money than wit; and by men who live by their wits and nothing else. But you must not be disappointed, if the search prove a long one before you run your hare down, for the {{indications}} you have given me are very doubtful. He may be living in Alsatia, hard by the Temple, which, though not so bad as it used to be, is still an abode of dangerous rogues. But <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> may meet him at the taverns in Westminster, or near Whitehall; for, if he has means to dress himself bravely, it is there he will most readily pick up gulls.|$|E

Because I am sincere; because I {{desire to}} be natural, and honest, and true; and because I am consistent with myself, you choose to misunderstand it all and to lay wrong strictures upon me. I do try to be consistent, and I think I fairly succeed; {{but you can see}} neither rhyme nor reason in my consistency. Perhaps it is because you are unused to consistent, natural women; because, <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>you</b> are only familiar with the hot-house breeds,--pretty, helpless, well-rounded, stall-fatted little things, blissfully innocent and criminally ignorant. They are not natural or strong; nor can they mother the natural and strong." ...|$|E

The will was drawn up by Colonel Bulstrode's lawyers, and they knew my uncle by sight; besides, all the legacies were exactly the same as in the other will, the signature and the written instructions were in his handwriting, and he signed it in the solicitor's office in the presence of two of their clerks. No, I don't think he can possibly mean that. It must be either Walter's abduction or that he is not John Simcoe, and I should say that the former is much the <b>more</b> <b>likely.</b> <b>You</b> see, he had no need of an accomplice in the matter of getting evidence as to identity, whereas he did need an accomplice in the carrying off of Walter. I should say that he is far too clever a man to let anyone into any of his secrets, unless he needed his assistance. I wonder who the man with him can be. He is dressed in good style, and I have certainly met him somewhere. I believe, as I said, it was at the opera. I should have thought that a man of that class is the last Simcoe would choose as a confederate." ...|$|E

50|$|During {{these events}} Marshall and Robin have dinner {{together}} having realised that they’ve never really {{spent much time}} alone. The dinner is initially awkward until Marshall reveals that the reason he doesn’t spend much time alone with Robin is due to Barney’s ‘Mermaid Theory’, that the longer you spend with someone the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> will want to sleep with them. Barney claimed the theory {{comes from the fact}} that sailors used to picture manatees as mermaids due to long periods without female contact. Marshall and Robin both get drunk and enjoy the evening though when they return to the apartment, Marshall begins seeing Robin as a mermaid. When she throws up all over the floor, however, Marshall once again sees her as a manatee, much to his relief.|$|E
