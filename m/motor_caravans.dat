50|$|The Sherwood was {{an estate}} car {{conversion}} based around the Ford Cortina but {{using a new}} chassis. The rear roof section was detachable to make the car into a pick-up. More unusual was the Starcraft, a six-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> conversion for the Ford Cortina Mk III to V. A new steel chassis took the Cortina's mechanical components and on this was mounted a large body shell which included an overhanging section above the driver and passenger seats. The bonnet area was restyled but the centre section of the Cortina was retained including wiring, instruments and windscreen.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Lifesure {{merged with}} another company called MCIA (Motor Caravan Insurance Agency) Limited.

50|$|The {{speed limit}} is 70 mph (112km/h) on motorways, 70 mph (112km/h) on dual carriageways, 60 mph (96km/h) on single carriageways and 30 mph (48km/h) {{in areas with}} street {{lighting}} (restricted roads). These limits may be reduced by roadside signs and apply to cars, motorcycles, car-derived vans up to 2 tonnes maximum laden weight (MLW), and to motorhomes or <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> not more than 3.05 tonnes maximum unladen weight. Other classes of vehicles are subject to lower limits on some roads.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the true}} {{measure of the}} success of the {{movement}} that Alan Rogers started is to note how many of the things he called for in his original guide have now become reality. Mains electricity connections in caravans and <b>motor</b> <b>caravans,</b> marked pitches of a minimum size, hot water freely available in the amenity blocks, British style toilets on French campsites, the use of trees and bushes to mark pitches and an end to the practice of over-crowding of sites during the peak summer holiday times.|$|E
50|$|On 13 November 2011, , a {{possible}} fourth {{member of the}} NSU, was arrested and brought the following day before a judge at Germany's Federal Court of Justice, who ordered him to be detained in custody. The German Attorney General's Office wanted Gerlach detained on suspicion of membership in a terrorist group. However the court's investigating judge only authorized Gerlach to be detained on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization. The Attorney General of Germany also supposed that he had rented a <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> for the NSU, which they used {{for the murder of}} the policewoman and severe maiming of her colleague, in Heilbronn.|$|R
50|$|The Thames van {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in helping the}} motorised caravan or campervan to establish itself in a period when people were extending their horizons with regard to holidays and camping. The Ford Thames 15 cwt van formed an ideal base for a <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> because it could double as an ordinary vehicle during the week and be used for picnics or breaks away from home at weekends. Its roughly square shape lent itself well to conversion to a caravan, as many people had noticed {{when they saw the}} estate car and 12 seater bus versions.|$|R
5000|$|At Olympia's 1909 Motor Show [...] "the most {{striking}} object {{on the stand}} of the Austin Motor Company" [...] was a 40-hp <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> inviting an immediate comparison with [...] "the woeful vehicle vulgarly known as a Black Maria". However it was fitted up with a telephone installation, lavatory, linen lockers, etc and on show with a dinner table laid for six. A kitchen was in a separate compartment at the back. Internal sleeping accommodation was provided for two and attendants could camp out under canvas in bunks over {{the roof of the}} driver's seat. The 7-hp, 15 and 18/24 models were also displayed.|$|R
50|$|The laws {{state that}} {{visitors}} with caravans must {{be members of}} The Caravan Club, who are required to act responsibly and to observe the Country Code {{and no more than}} 5 caravans may be accommodated on the site at any one time.

CLs are for recreational purposes and only touring caravans, <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> or trailer tents are permitted - tents are not permitted, other than attached caravan awnings, toilet tents or small pup tents; and permanently sited (static) caravans are not permitted on the same landholding.|$|E
50|$|The Mayor of London {{announced}} {{establishment of}} a low-emission zone which came into effect on 4 February 2008 covering almost all of Greater London - the largest such zone in the world. London currently has levels of air pollution among the worst in Europe and road transport related emissions account for around half of total emissions of PM10 and NOx in the capital. The Low Emission Zone will target emissions of these pollutants from older diesel-engined lorries, buses, coaches, vans, minibuses and other heavy vehicles that are derived from lorries and vans such as <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> and motorised horse boxes. There will be a phased introduction of the scheme from 4 February 2008 through to January 2012. Different vehicles will be affected over time and increasingly tougher emissions standards will apply.|$|E
50|$|Arthur P Compton set {{up several}} coachbuilding businesses, {{including}} Compton, Sons and Terry {{which was founded}} in 1929 in Merton, South West London. He left this in 1930 to set up on his own and the other partner D.H. Terry with D.H.B. Power renamed the company Abbey Coachworks. In 1933 the company moved to larger premises in Acton, North West London. In 1936 they took over the Wingham brand from Martin Walter and changed their name to Wingham Martin Walter. They exhibited at the 1937 London Motor Show under the new name but by the late 1930s custom coachbuilding on car maker's chassis was in terminal decline and they seem to have gone out of business shortly afterwards. Martin Walter themselves remained in business and after the Second World War made a range of <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> under the Dormobile name, and ambulance and minibus bodies on Bedford Austin and Ford chassis.|$|E
5000|$|During {{its life}} the van {{underwent}} minor improvements under the metal. However, even in 1967 the vans were still shipped with synchromesh {{on the top}} three forward gears only. The engine lived in the driver's cabin between the two seats: the van was considered unusually noisy, even in the 1960s. A J4-based petrol-engined <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> was tested by Britain's Autocar magazine in 1967. It managed a maximum speed of 63 mph (101 km/h) and a time from 0-50 mph (80 km/h) of 20.2 seconds. [...] The vehicle as tested weighed 2910 lb and overall petrol consumption for the test came in at 22.7 mpgimp.|$|R

25|$|Stagecoach {{was born}} out of {{deregulation}} of the British express coach market in the early 1980s, though its roots {{can be traced back to}} 1976 when Ann Gloag and her husband Robin set up a small <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> and minibus hire business called Gloagtrotter. Ann's accountant brother Brian Souter joined the firm and expanded the business into bus hire. Robin Gloag subsequently sold his shareholding in the business and ceased any involvement in 1982 with the collapse of his marriage to Ann. The Transport Act 1980, which freed express services of 35 miles and over from regulation by the Traffic Commissioner, brought new opportunities for the Perth based company and services were launched from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches. For a while, they offered a very personal service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag making up sandwiches and snacks for the passengers.|$|R
40|$|Freedom Camping {{has gained}} {{popularity}} in New Zealand {{in the last}} decade. This has created the potential for consequential environmental problems. Various public sectors {{are concerned about the}} disposal of untreated sewerage commonly disposed besides roads, in rest places and in streams and rivers. At the same time campervan travellers have expressed frustration because there are limited public effluent disposal facilities situated around New Zealand. Members of the New Zealand <b>Motor</b> <b>Caravan</b> Association Incorporated (NZMCA) completed surveys detailing their travel patterns and travel behaviour. Data was modelled and analysed using a Geographic Information System, to determine locations where public disposal facilities were required. Research indicated that this issue is complex and there are many factors involved, which determine whether travellers discharge of effluent legally, or not. Recommendations include introducing an awareness program to educate travellers about potential environmental and health hazards associated with illegal effluent discharge. Information also needs to be widely distributed, regarding the availability and characteristics of disposal facilities around New Zealand...|$|R
