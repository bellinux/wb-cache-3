500|$|Kennedy's {{assassination}} was {{a blow to}} {{the optimism}} for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s. Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, [...] "It made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second." ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings made an {{appearance}} on the Phil Donahue Show in 1970 and on PBS' David Susskind Show in 1971, along with six other lesbians, including Lilli Vincenz and Barbara Love. They {{were among the first}} open lesbians to appear on television in the US, and debated long-held stereotypes about gays with Susskind. A week after her appearance on the David Susskind Show, a middle-aged couple approached Gittings in the supermarket to claim, [...] "You made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> you gay people love each other just the way Arnold and I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February, amid {{an online}} {{campaign}} for Middle East-style protests in major Chinese cities by overseas dissidents, Ai posted on his Twitter account: [...] "I didn’t care about jasmine at first, {{but people who}} are scared by jasmine sent out information about how harmful jasmine is often, which makes <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> jasmine is what scares them the most. What a jasmine!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... “I Can’t Fix You”, {{was written}} for one of Sasha’s friends who is {{struggling}} with addiction. “I wanted to save this person. I wanted to fix them. And, I couldn’t, ” she says upon revealing the tear-inducing inspiration behind the song. “And it kind of came down to <b>me</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>that,</b> because I couldn’t do that, all I could do was love them and support them, {{and try to keep}} them accountable.” ...|$|R

2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E

60|$|With {{the help}} of a long line I lowered myself deep down into the sea until I was enabled to ascertain, {{approximately}} at any rate, our longitude. A fierce thrill went through me at the thought that this longitude was our longitude, hers and mine. On the way up, hand over hand, I observed a long shark looking at <b>me.</b> <b>Realizing</b> <b>that</b> the fellow if voracious might prove dangerous, I lost but little time--indeed, I may say I lost absolutely no time--in coming up the rope.|$|R
5000|$|Bill Geddie, who {{originally}} served as co-executive producer, {{was the lone}} recurring male persona, sometimes shown as stepping out from behind camera {{to interact with the}} hosts. In an interview with Broadcasting & Cable he stated: [...] "I'm not an on-air personality and I think anybody who's seen <b>me</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that.</b> But early on, the network thought it would be kind of fun to see there's this guy here in charge, but if you watch the show, you see that generally speaking I'm a side player and I'm basically there to get a laugh." ...|$|R
60|$|It is a feat beyond <b>me</b> to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> he is sixty-nine years old. And when I {{look at the}} {{tremendous}} build of him and at his fearful, man-handling hands, I conjure up a vision of him avenging Captain Somers's murder.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} natural that he should feel resentment; {{but there was a}} cold vindictiveness in his tone which made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> it was as well for the outlaw that I had not left him in the room. Then he spoke again: ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} my revulsion of feeling. A single {{incident}} changed all my sympathy to loathing, and made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> my employer still remained {{all that he}} had ever been, with the additional vice of hypocrisy. What happened was as follows.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not on the}} sick-list," [...] he said, gruffly. There was {{something}} in the hard, rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions, and made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I was {{face to face with the}} man of the Lena Valley and Bluemansdyke, the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut the throats of its occupants.|$|E

6000|$|The {{sight of}} my white-haired father {{wandering}} about the yard, dazed, bewildered, his {{eyes filled with}} a look of despair at last decided <b>me.</b> <b>Realizing</b> <b>that</b> this was his true home; that no other roof could have the same appeal, and he could not be transplanted, I resolved to cover his head; {{to make it possible for}} him to live out his few remaining years under this roof with his granddaughters. [...] "For his sake and the children's sake," [...] I announced to Zulime, [...] "I shall begin at once to clear away and restore. Before the winter comes you shall all be back in the old House. Perhaps we can eat our Thanksgiving dinner in the restored dining-room." ...|$|R
30|$|Honestly speaking, this [cogen] {{is a very}} {{deliberate}} meet-up {{session with}} them. If without this cogen, I don't think I will have the time, or make time specially for them to actually get to know them, like {{how they feel about}} science lessons. Because my priority will be given to graduating classes, for sure. So, I think it is a good chance for me to know what they feel about it, and what they hope to see improvement. Then it also made <b>me</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that,</b> “Eh actually I haven’t done group work with them.” As in I did, but I have my hesitations. You know, because of the orderliness. […] Ya. So, it is a good attempt, to actually get to know them better.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps it's {{better that}} you should learn the truth," [...] he went on. [...] "For {{the last few years}} my affairs have not gone well. Gerald's extravagance has been a heavy drain; Lance is young and rash; and I feel now that the {{prosperity}} of Allenwood is threatened. The American made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that.</b> In fact, the fellow has brought us trouble ever since he came." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 13, 2003, Marquis {{was traded}} to the St. Louis Cardinals along with relief pitcher Ray King and rookie {{prospect}} Adam Wainwright for outfielder J. D.

60|$|Almost as {{he spoke}} I saw {{through the windows of}} the hair-dresser's shop a {{familiar}} figure entering the hotel. I left Ashley hurriedly, and in a moment I was face to face with Felicia. She gave a little cry when she saw me, and it was a joy to <b>me</b> to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> it was a cry of pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder do {{you know}} all that you did?" [...] she asked him, musingly. [...] "Shall I tell you, my lord? You cured me of a folly. I had been blind, and you made me see. I had foolishly thought to escape one evil, and you made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I was rushing into a worse. You saved me from myself. You may have made me suffer then; {{but it was a}} healing hurt you dealt me. And should I bear you an ill-will for that?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{loved that}} old garden by the harbour shore. Even Abel himself, I think, {{could hardly have}} felt a deeper affection for it. When its gate closed behind me it shut out the world and my {{corroding}} memories and discontents. In its peace my soul emptied itself of the bitterness which had been filling and spoiling it, and grew normal and healthy again, aided thereto by Abel's wise words. He never preached, but he radiated courage and endurance and a frank acceptance of the hard things of life, {{as well as a}} cordial welcome of its pleasant things. He was the sanest soul I ever met. He neither minimized ill nor exaggerated good, but he held that we should never be controlled by either. Pain should not depress us unduly, nor pleasure lure us into forgetfulness and sloth. All unknowingly he made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I had been a bit of a coward and a shirker. I began to understand that my personal woes were not the most important things in the universe, even to myself. In short, Abel taught me to laugh again; and when a man can laugh wholesomely things are not going too badly with him.|$|E
60|$|In the Treaty Ports, Europeans and Americans live {{in their}} own quarters, with streets well paved and lighted, houses in European style, and shops full of American and English goods. There is {{generally}} also a Chinese part of the town, with narrow streets, gaily decorated shops, and the rich mixture of smells characteristic of China. Often one passes through a gate, suddenly, {{from one to the}} other; after the cheerful disordered beauty of the old town, Europe's ugly cleanliness and Sunday-go-to-meeting decency make a strange complex impression, half-love and half-hate. In the European town one finds safety, spaciousness and hygiene; in the Chinese town, romance, overcrowding and disease. In spite of my affection for China, these transitions always made <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I am a European; for me, the Chinese manner of life would not mean happiness. But after making all necessary deductions for the poverty and the disease, I am inclined to think that Chinese life brings more happiness to the Chinese than English life does to us. At any rate this {{seemed to me to be}} true for the men; for the women I do not think it would be true.|$|E
60|$|My tongue pressed {{itself against}} my teeth; the sacking trembled, and a faint luminousness began to creep through its hempen strands.

I would rather set it aside than face the predicament described in our song 'Losing It'… ...|$|R
60|$|While {{one might}} have counted ten I entirely forgot what had been agreed upon between Hiram Griffin and me, and my feet were already upon the rungs of the ladder to descend, when the cob-webs seemed {{suddenly}} to have been blown from my brain, allowing <b>me</b> to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> despite all the dangers Hiram had succeeded in gratifying his whim without loss of liberty.|$|R

60|$|Even as I {{gazed at}} little Frenchie {{in what was}} very like bewilderment, I noted that the lad was looking here and there furtively, {{as if to make}} certain there were no eavesdroppers near, and on the instant the haze of perplexity was cleared from my mind, {{allowing}} <b>me</b> to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the French lad had some plan on foot whereby the mischief wrought through Saul might be counteracted.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the world forces <b>me</b> to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> our common {{language}} is not only inaccurate, but totally inadequate to describe reality.
