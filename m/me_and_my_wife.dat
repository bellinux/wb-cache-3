500|$|When Peter regained enough {{strength}} he {{told his}} story, which Johnston later wrote down and is now kept with his papers at Duke University. Peter had been a slave of a Mr. Read in Charlotte County, a neighbor of John Randolph. He had been sold (apparently because of Read's debts) to a trader, leaving behind a wife and young daughter to work a cotton field for thirty-five years in Mississippi. When he was freed, Peter walked from Mississippi until he reached Abingdon in his quest to return home. Johnston wrote: [...] "It was evident to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that all our care could not rebuild that worn-out body, and that death was near at hand. He weakened rapidly ... His life was weary, toilsome, and full of trouble. But surely the Lord has rewards for such as he, and will give him rest in all eternity, and permit him to see Susy and his Mammy and Daddy." [...] Peter died of tuberculosis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{name change}} to [...] "Spike TV" [...] was {{supposed}} to be official on June 16, 2003. However, three days earlier on June 13, film director Spike Lee won a New York Supreme Court injunction preventing the name change. Lee claimed that because of his well-known popularity in Hollywood, viewers would therefore assume that he was associated with the new channel. Lee stated in court papers that: [...] "The media description of this change of name, as well as comments made to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> confirmed what was obvious—that Spike TV referred to Spike Lee." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{remained}} childless. When Sir Edward Bromley died in 1626, disputes {{about the}} inheritance {{of the family}} estates had already begun. The codicil to his will showed {{that he had been}} forced to sacrifice some of the lands he had intended as part of Lady Margaret's jointure to placate the Davenports, his great-niece and her husband, who were ultimately to acquire the main estate at Hallon, next to Worfield, after protracted litigation. As compensation, he left her all his moveable property, although he had originally intended to give her only the use of it during her life and the right to bequeath £400-worth in her own will. For everything not relating to the property dispute, Lady Margaret was appointed executrix. Sir Edward set aside £100 for a monument [...] "to be set up in Shifnall Church, or elsewhere, to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> Dame Margaret." [...] However, he directed that his burial itself be [...] "without funeral pompe," [...] probably an indication of Puritan views. He was buried in the church at Worfield, where his wife subsequently had the prescribed monument built, with an inscription attesting her role: [...] "Dame Margaret his wife according to his will did dedicate This monument to his memory." ...|$|E

[...] Charles also revealed that Steve McDonald's reaction to the relationship is that he is not impressed.Liz and Lloyd's relationship was revisited in August 2015 when Lloyd sleeps with Liz {{in the wake of his}} split from Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon). Lloyd immediately regrets spending the night with Liz, but he is backed into a corner when she explains to a horrified Steve that they have a future together. Asked in an interview with Digital Spy if he would ever put Liz and Lloyd together Craig Charles replied: [...] "Well they do have a history of course. On paper it is not the most obvious of matches but they do get on really well. This is probably not the best thing for either of them at the moment so it is no doubt doomed!" [...] Charles later went on to reveal that Lloyd is the one who regrets it the most as he is very wry of upsetting both Liz and Steve (Simon Gregson). Lloyd and Liz are caught out the next morning by Steve and Michelle (Kym Marsh). Asked how Steve react to the news that Lloyd has slept with his mum, Charles replied: [...] "Steve is horrified but Liz insists to Steve they have done nothing wrong and that they have a future together. This was not what Lloyd was thinking but he now has to go along with it." [...] Charles went on to say: [...] "Steve is the person Lloyd is most worried about upsetting - they have only just got their friendship back on an even keel and now he is risking it again. But really he would be better being up front now, dragging it on is only going to make it worse in the end." ...|$|R
