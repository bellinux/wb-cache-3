60|$|Beatrice {{was dressed}} very quietly in brown, {{with a simple}} but courageous broad-brimmed hat, and an {{unexpected}} quality of being grown-up and responsible. She guided her step-mother through the first encounter, scrutinised my aunt, and got us all well in movement through the house, and then she {{turned her attention to}} <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and half-confident smile.|$|R

60|$|Dear Mr. Chorley,--Kindnesses {{are more}} {{frequent}} things with me than gladnesses, but I thank you earnestly for {{both in the}} letter I have this moment received.[109] You have given <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> sudden pleasure which goes deeper (I am very sure) than self-love, for it must be something better than vanity that brings the tears so near the eyes.

She ambled out into the other room, and directly Uncle Emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves, with a pitcher of water. He turns around to get a glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket. 'Great post- holes!' thinks I, 'but here's a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts, protecting it with firearms. I've known outfits that wouldn't do that much by a family feud.' ...|$|E

60|$|We {{said little}} more that night. When we parted she gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> warning glance, {{as if to}} remind me of what she had said about the danger of interference. Her {{cautions}} would have made little difference to me could I have seen my way to benefiting Barrington Cowles by anything which I might say. But what could I say? I might say that her former suitors had been unfortunate. I might say that I believed her to be a cruel-hearted woman. I might say that I considered her to possess wonderful, and almost preternatural powers. What impression would any of these accusations make upon an ardent lover--a man with my friend's enthusiastic temperament? I felt that it would be useless to advance them, so I was silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am pleased}} {{to hear you say}} these words." [...] She gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> look. Quick, not stealthy. If there was one thing of which she was {{absolutely}} incapable, it was stealthiness, Her sincerity was expressed in the very rhythm of her walk. It was I who was looking at her covertly--if I may say so. I knew where she had been, but I did not know what she had seen and heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies. I use the word aristocratic, {{for want of a better}} term. The Chateau Borel, embowered in the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds, had its fame in our day, like the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman, Madame de Stael, in the Napoleonic era. Only the Napoleonic despotism, the booted heir of the Revolution, which counted that intellectual woman for an enemy worthy to be watched, was something quite unlike the autocracy in mystic vestments, engendered by the slavery of a Tartar conquest. And Madame de S-- was very far from resembling the gifted author of Corinne. She made a great noise about being persecuted. I don't know if she were regarded in certain circles as dangerous. As to being watched, I imagine that the Chateau Borel could be subjected only to a most distant observation. It was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for hatching superior plots--whether serious or futile. But all this did not interest me. I wanted to know the effect its extraordinary inhabitants and its special atmosphere had produced on a girl like Miss Haldin, so true, so honest, but so dangerously inexperienced! Her unconsciously lofty ignorance of the baser instincts of mankind left her disarmed before her own impulses. And there was also that friend of her brother, the significant new arrival from Russia.... I wondered whether she had managed to meet him.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, {{the water}} being low, the {{breakers}} were at {{some distance from}} shore, {{and we had to}} watch for a smooth moment after bringing the boats to the water's edge, and so got safely out to sea. At the two next villages, Tobo and Ossong, we also took in fresh men, who came swimming through the surf; and at the latter place the Rajah came on board and accompanied me to Kissalaut, where he has a house which he lent me during my stay. Here again was a heavy surf, and it was with great difficulty we got the boats safely hauled up. At Amboyna I had been promised at this season a calm sea and the wind off shore, but in this case, as in every other, I had been unable to obtain any reliable information as to the winds and seasons of places distant two or three days' journey. It appears, however, that owing to {{the general direction of the}} island of Ceram (E.S.E. and W.N.W.), there is a heavy surf and scarcely any shelter on the south coast during the west monsoon, when alone a journey to the eastward can be safely made; while during the east monsoon, when I proposed to return along the north coast to Wahai, I should probably find that equally exposed and dangerous. But although the general direction of the west monsoon in the Banda sea causes a heavy swell, with bad surf on the coast, yet we had little advantage of the wind; for, owing I suppose to the numerous bays and headlands, we had contrary south-east or even due east winds all the way, and had to make almost the whole distance from Amboyna by force of rowing. We had therefore all the disadvantages, and none of the advantages, of this west monsoon, which I was told would insure <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and pleasant journey.|$|E

60|$|A certain bright smile, which I {{never saw}} {{on any other}} face, died away, even while I thought how good it was, and how {{familiar}} it had once been to me; and she asked <b>me,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> change of expression (we were drawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's circumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had not told me yet, Agnes became thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm tremble in mine.|$|R
500|$|Nick is {{an awesome}} producer. He {{really helped me}} get the plan and have {{confidence}} in the decisions that we made. For <b>me,</b> I have <b>a</b> lot of ideas and sometimes it just comes down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm doing these things I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping <b>me</b> make <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|R
6000|$|There is {{no doubt}} our present address, all round, lacked a little the easiest grace--or at least Louisa's and mine did. I felt too much the appeal of her {{exhibition}} to notice closely the style of encounter of the young people. I couldn't {{get it out of}} my head, as I have sufficiently indicated, that Mrs. Pallant was playing a game, and I'm afraid she saw in my face that this suspicion had been the motive of my journey. I had come there to find her out. The knowledge of my purpose couldn't help her to make me very welcome, and that's why I speak of our meeting constrainedly. We observed none the less all the forms, and the admirable scene left us plenty to talk about. I made no reference before Linda to the retreat from Homburg. This young woman looked even prettier than she had done on the eve of that manoeuvre and gave no sign of an awkward consciousness. She again so struck me as a charming clever girl that I was freshly puzzled to know why we should get--or should have got--into a tangle about her. People had to want to complicate a situation to do it on so simple a pretext as that Linda was in every way beautiful. This was the clear fact: so why shouldn't the presumptions be in favour of every result of it? One of the effects of that cause, on the spot, was {{that at the end of}} a very short time Archie proposed to her to take a turn with him in his boat, which awaited us at the foot of the steps. She looked at her mother with a smiling [...] "May I, mamma?" [...] and Mrs. Pallant answered [...] "Certainly, darling, if you're not afraid." [...] At this--I scarcely knew why--I sought the relief of laughter: it must have affected me as comic that the girl's general competence should suffer the imputation of that particular flaw. She gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> slightly sharp look as she turned away with my nephew; it appeared to challenge me a little--"Pray what's the matter with YOU?" [...] It was the first expression of the kind I had ever seen in her face. Mrs. Pallant's attention, on the other hand, rather strayed from me; after we had been left there together she sat silent, not heeding me, looking at the lake and mountains--at the snowy crests crowned with the flush of evening. She seemed not even to follow our young companions as they got into their boat and pushed off. For some minutes I respected her mood; I walked slowly up and down the terrace and lighted a cigar, as she had always permitted me to do at Homburg. I found in her, it was true, rather a new air of weariness; her fine cold well-bred face was pale; I noted in it new lines of fatigue, almost of age. At last I stopped in front of her and--since she looked so sad--asked if she had been having bad news.|$|E
5000|$|The Fw 190 {{was thought}} to be Fw 190A-5 Wrk Nr 2511 of 6./SKG 10, flown by Oberleutnant Josef Keller. I then spotted another Fw 190 to starboard. I flew {{straight}} over the top of it in order to identify it in the failing light. The enemy aircraft pulled his nose up and gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> squirt. I pulled straight up to about 1000ft, and turning to port, dived right onto his tail, opening fire from 300 yards and closing to 150 yards. I fired a four-second burst, seeing strikes and flames all over the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft gradually lost height, with smoke and flames coming from it, skimmed for some distance along {{the surface of the water}} and then sank. I orbited around taking cine gun snaps of the oil patch and pieces of wreckage that were visible.|$|E
5000|$|Arriving at the temple, Yongjia {{walks around}} Huineng {{three times and}} then stands staring at him. Huineng {{comments}} on his lack of formality, to which Yongjia responds, [...] "Since the question of incessant rebirth is a momentous one and death may come at any moment, I {{have no time to}} waste on ceremony, and wish you to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> answer to this problem". Huineng suggests he [...] "embody birthlessness" [...] in order to overcome impermanence. Yongjia immediately displays understanding of this, but then readies himself to leave. Huineng asks if he is not leaving too quickly. Yongjia then says {{there is no such thing}} as 'quickly', for motion does not truly exist. Huineng asks why this should be the case, to which he responds that any distinction about quickness or slowness is an artificial construct. Huineng then exclaims that his interlocutor now truly understands the concept of birthlessness, but Yongjia cleverly asks if a mere concept, another form of artificial distinction, can really have a meaning. Huineng asks, [...] "Who makes a distinction about whether there is a meaning or not. Yongjia responds, [...] "Distinctions are meaningless!", and Huineng cries, [...] "Excellent! Excellent! Now, just stay here a single night!" [...] This is so that Huineng can officially confirm his enlightenment. And thus, Yongjia is known as [...] "The Overnight Guest" [...] because he proved his enlightenment to Huineng in one night.|$|E

40|$|Nuclepore {{filters are}} {{capillary}} pore membrane filters {{with an array}} of microscopic cylindrical holes of uniform diameters. Their structure is suitable for particle collection and ensuing offline analyses, therefore they are being widely used for exposure assessment of engineered nanoparticles, ambient PM 2. 5, virus, bacteria, asbestos, etc., as well as in powder manufacturing industries. However, there exists a particle size range in which all the filtration capture mechanisms are not effective. This size is the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), which corresponds to the minimum efficiency (ME) of the filter. Both MPPS and ME are important parameters for a user to select an adequate Nuclepore filter and preferred operating conditions. For rapid estimation of the MPPS and ME, we derived their explicit expressions by simplifying the formulas for the impaction, diffusion and interception deposition and differentiating the combined efficiency with respect to the particle size. The comparison between the experimental data and the prediction from the explicit expressions shows the explicit expressions can provide MPPS {{for a wide range of}} filter properties (pore radius, porosity and length) and filtration conditions (particle density, face velocity and temperature). The ME can also be estimated satisfactorily when a simplified term of filter surface diffusion deposition is further considered. By the explicit expressions of MPPS and <b>ME,</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> screening for selecting a Nuclepore filter with the proper properties and suitable filtration conditions can be easily achieved. From the theoretical point of view, the explicit expressions facilitate better understanding of the effects of filter properties and conditions on the filtration characteristic...|$|E

Then she dropped her eyes, to lift them again, laughing.|$|R
60|$|She came back, {{with some}} bread and meat {{and a little}} mug of beer. She put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I cannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name was,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the girl looked at <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> delight in having been the cause of them. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a contemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was so wounded--and left me.|$|R
