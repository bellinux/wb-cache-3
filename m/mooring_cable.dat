40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{modelling}} snap loads in <b>mooring</b> <b>cables.</b> Snap loads are a known {{problem for the}} established oil and gas industry, and they pose a major challenge to robust mooring design for the growing industry of wave energy conversion. We present a discontinuous Galerkin formulation using a local Lax-Friedrich Riemann solver to capture snap loads in <b>mooring</b> <b>cables</b> with high accuracy. An hp−adaptive scheme is used to dynamically change the mesh size h and the polynomial order p, based on the local solution quality. We implement an error indicator and a shock identifier to capture shocks with slope-limited linear elements, while using high-order Legendre polynomials for smooth solution regions. The results show exponential error convergence of order p + 1 ∕ 2 for smooth solutions. Efficient and accurate computations of idealised shock waves in both linear and nonlinear materials were achieved using hp−adaptivity. Comparison with experimental data gives excellent results, including snap load propagation in a mooring chain. Application on a wave energy device using coupled simulations {{highlights the importance of}} the touch-down region in catenary moorings. We conclude that the formulation is able to handle snap loads with good accuracy, with implications for both maximum peak load and fatigue load estimates of <b>mooring</b> <b>cables...</b>|$|R
50|$|On 10 April 1901, {{while at}} Shanghai, she parted her <b>mooring</b> <b>cables</b> during a storm and drifted across the bows of {{battleship}} HMS Glory. Glory's bow punched {{a hole in}} Centurions hull below the waterline, but the damage was not serious and was repaired at Hong Kong.|$|R
5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|E
5000|$|While an airship {{approached}} the mast slowly {{against the wind}} a <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> was let out from nose {{to the ground and}} linked, by a ground party, {{to the end of the}} <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> paid out from the mast head. The cable was then slowly wound in with the airship riding about 600 ft above the mast and down wind, with one engine running astern to maintain a pull on the cable. At this point, two side wires - or ‘yaw guys’ - were also connected to cables taken from the nose of the airship to pulley blocks some hundreds of feet apart on the ground and thence to winches at the base of the mast.All three cables were then wound in together, the main pull being taken on the <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> while the yaw guys steadied the ship. When all the cable had been wound, an articulated mooring cone on the nose of the airship locked home into the cup on the mast. The mast fitting was made free to rotate as the airship swung with the wind with freedom also for pitch and roll.A gangway, like a drawbridge, which could be drawn up flush with the nose of the airship, was then let down with its free end resting on the parapet of the platform running round the mast. Passengers and crew boarded and disembarked from the ship under cover along this gangway. About twelve men were needed to moor an airship to a mast.Four high masts of the Cardington type were built along the proposed British Empire Airship Service routes, at Cardington itself, at Montreal (Canada), Ismailia (Egypt) and Karachi (then India, now in Pakistan). None of these survive. Similar masts were proposed at sites in Australia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Bombay, Keeling Islands, Kenya, Malta, at Ohakea in New Zealand, and in South Africa. The general site specifications can be found in documents produced by the British government.|$|E
50|$|The {{paravane}} {{weapon was}} developed by the British inventor Sir Dennistoun Burney as a means to sweep enemy mines. Towed behind a ship, the paravane wire would either cut the mine's <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> or bring the mine and paravane together, detonating the mine. There are offensive and defensive paravanes. There are main paravanes and auxiliary protector paravanes. Some paravanes are equipped with cable cutters that cut the moored mines. Explosive paravanes are essentially a towable or controllable mine. The US Department of Defense continues to have interest in paravanes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFloating {{wave energy}} {{converters}} (WECs) {{operating in the}} resonance region are strongly affected by non-linearities arising from {{the interaction between the}} waves, the WEC motion and the mooring restraints. To compute the restrained WEC motion thus requires a method which readily accounts for these effects. This paper presents a method for coupled mooring analysis using a two-phase Navier–Stokes (VOF–RANS) model and a high-order finite element model of <b>mooring</b> <b>cables.</b> The method is validated against experimental measurements of a cylindrical buoy in regular waves, slack-moored with three catenary <b>mooring</b> <b>cables.</b> There is overall a good agreement between experimental and computational results with respect to buoy motions and mooring forces. Most importantly, the coupled numerical model accurately recreates the strong wave height dependence of the response amplitude operators seen in the experiments...|$|R

Her <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> parted and she was driven within range of Spanish shore batteries; Hallowell, ashore to sit at a court-martial, was denied permission to rejoin the ship and take her to safety. She was subsequently wrecked off Monte Hacho in high winds during her officers' attempts to move to a safer anchorage, with the loss of almost 500 lives.|$|E
50|$|Around 7:00 p.m. local time, at an {{altitude}} of 650 ft, the Hindenburg made its final approach to the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. This was to be a high landing, known as a flying moor, because the airship would drop its landing ropes and <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> at a high altitude, and then be winched down to the mooring mast. This type of landing maneuver would reduce the number of ground crewmen, but would require more time. Although the high landing was a common procedure for American airships, the Hindenburg had only performed this maneuver a few times in 1936 while landing in Lakehurst.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{added two}} {{refinements}} to their balloons, [...] "Double Parachute Link" [...] (DPL) and [...] "Double Parachute/Ripping" [...] (DP/R). The former {{was triggered by}} the shock of an enemy bomber snagging the cable, causing that section of cable to be explosively released complete with parachutes at either end; the combined weight and drag bringing down the aircraft. The latter was intended to render the balloon safe if it broke free accidentally. The heavy <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> would separate at the balloon and {{fall to the ground}} under a parachute; {{at the same time a}} panel would be ripped away from the balloon causing it to deflate and fall independently to the ground.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} {{discovered}} that the mines were of German origin but they were free of rust and marine growth. They were also freshly painted and their <b>mooring</b> <b>cables</b> were recently lubricated. It was concluded that the minefield was laid shortly before the incident involving Saumarez and Volage.

5000|$|United States {{participation}} in the minesweeping effort was overseen by Rear Admiral Strauss aboard the repair ship Blackhawk from which he had commanded the minelaying operation. Tugs [...] and [...] towed Admiralty wooden sailing smacks Red Rose and Red Fern out to conduct the first trial sweep in December. Sweeping was accomplished by suspending a serrated wire between two ships on a parallel course. While held underwater by planing devices called [...] "kites", the wire would foul the cables suspending the buoyant mines above their anchors. If the serrated wire parted the mine <b>mooring</b> <b>cable,</b> the mine would bob to the surface to be destroyed by gunfire. The smacks swept and destroyed six mines before winter weather halted further work at sea. The winter was spent testing an electrical protective device {{to reduce the risk}} of sweeping the antenna mines with steel-hulled ships. Patapsco and Patuxent tested the protective device by sweeping 39 mines in March. [...] Royal Navy minesweeping efforts involved 421 vessels manned by 600 officers and 15,000 men from 1 April to 30 November 1919.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of interconnected floating breakwaters {{has been studied}} theoretically and experimentally. For this type of shore-protection system, problems that {{must be dealt with}} include wave loads on the breakwaters caused by the interaction between the bodies and the waves, motions of the moored breakwaters caused by the waves, changed wave fields in front of and behind the breakwaters, and forces on the <b>mooring</b> <b>cables</b> and in interconnections between breakwater units. These problems have been solved in two major steps. The first step consists in solving the hydrodynamic forces in the frequency domain by means of linearized diffraction theory. The boundary value problem involved in obtaining the velocity potential on or around the bodies is solved numerically by a panel method. The second step deals with the dynamic response problem. The equation of motion is extended to include the interaction between the bodies conveyed by mechanical couplings and the interaction between a body and its <b>mooring</b> <b>cables.</b> Some significant nonlinear effects are also taken into account in the dynamic modelling, such as wave drift force, viscous damping, and drag force on the <b>mooring</b> <b>cables.</b> Owing to the facts that restoring forces imposed by the <b>mooring</b> <b>cables</b> are highly non-linear even for a small motion, and that the non-linear stiffness for a complex cable arrangement cannot be linearized by any simple method, the Newton-Raphson method is applied with an iteration technique for the resulting non-linear systems of equations. Based on the theories presented, a computer program FB (floating bodies) was developed for estimating the wave loads. An extension of the FB program has been made in conjunction with a well-developed dynamic mooring analysis program, MODEX. The program package should be of practical use for predicting the wave loads, system response, wave field near the objects, and the dynamic performance of the cables. Experiments on box-type floating breakwaters were carried out in a model basin with waves of different heights and periods. Results from model tests are presented for motions, cable tensions and wave attenuation for regular beam and oblique waves. The 3 -D motion tests were performed using a camera and video processor-based measurement system, MacReflex. Data aquisition for waves and forces was carried out by another system, MP 100. Results indicate that the dynamic model should prove to be a useful tool in the design of floating breakwaters and offshore structures...|$|R

50|$|Three to {{five percent}} of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones {{detected}} premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from 250 ft on the first minelaying excursion to 300 ft on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> attachment points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified relay armature sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions.|$|E
50|$|Of the 12 crewmen {{in the bow}} of the airship, {{only three}} survived. Four of these 12 men were {{standing}} on the mooring shelf, a platform up at the very tip of the bow from which the forwardmost landing ropes and the steel <b>mooring</b> <b>cable</b> were released to the ground crew, and which was directly at the forward end of the axial walkway and just ahead of gas cell #16. The rest were standing either along the lower keel walkway ahead of the control car, or else on platforms beside the stairway leading up the curve of the bow to the mooring shelf. During the fire the bow hung in the air at roughly a 45-degree angle and flames shot forward through the axial walkway, bursting through the bow (and the bow gas cells) like a blowtorch. The three men from the forward section who survived (elevatorman Kurt Bauer, cook Alfred Grözinger, and electrician Josef Leibrecht) were those furthest aft of the bow, and two of them (Bauer and Grözinger) happened to be standing near two large triangular air vents, through which cool air was being drawn by the fire. Neither of these men sustained more than superficial burns. Most of the men standing along the bow stairway either fell aft into the fire, or tried to leap from the ship when it was still too high in the air. Three of the four men standing on the mooring shelf inside the very tip of the bow were actually taken from the wreck alive, though one (Erich Spehl, a rigger) died shortly afterwards in the Air Station's infirmary, and the other two (helmsman Alfred Bernhard and apprentice elevatorman Ludwig Felber) were reported by newspapers to have initially survived the fire, and then to subsequently have died at area hospitals during the night or early the following morning. Hydrogen fires are notable for being less destructive to immediate surroundings than gasoline explosions because of the buoyancy of H2, which causes heat of combustion to be released upwards more than circumferentially as the leaked mass ascends in the atmosphere; hydrogen fires are more survivable than fires of gasoline or wood. The hydrogen in the Hindenburg burned out within about 90 seconds.|$|E
