50|$|During {{the first}} season of ESPN Sunday <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> (1987), the very {{first game of the}} package, between the New York Giants and New England Patriots, had WABC (the American Broadcasting Company's {{flagship}} station out of New York City) produce a completely separate telecast from ESPN's (rather than an over-the-air station simply simulcasting ESPN's broadcast in the competing teams' home markets). The reason behind this was that WABC's union contract at the time, prohibited non-union workers, such as those at ESPN, from producing live events for WABC. As such, McPherrin would provide play-by-play while <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football's</b> Frank Gifford and Lynn Swann would serve as his color commentators.|$|R
5|$|On <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> {{against the}} {{defending}} champion Buccaneers, Manning and the Colts trailed 35–14 in the final five minutes.

Highlights of the game included Cowboys running back Herschel Walker, in his first NFL game, rushing 10 times for 64yards and the game-winning touchdown, and fellow running back Tony Dorsett scoring on a 36-yard screen pass on the game's opening drive. The Giants struggled {{at the start of}} the game; they failed to get a first down on their first three drives, but their offense came alive and scored 28 points in the final three quarters.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots {{rivalry with}} the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts {{ran through the}} two clubs' tenure {{together}} in the AFC East (1970–2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21–17 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34–27 on <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29–23 in their final season in Baltimore.

5|$|They {{won their}} first 10 games, setting a {{franchise}} record for best start to a season. In those 10 wins the Giants {{did not allow}} more than 20 points in any game, and allowed 7 points or less 5 times. The San Francisco 49ers also {{got off to a}} strong start, matching the Giants with their own 10–0 start. As their Week 13 <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> matchup approached, it became increasingly possible that it would become the first matchup of 11–0 teams in NFL history. However, the Giants lost their next game, 31–13 to the Philadelphia Eagles, and the 49ers also lost their next game. The game drew high ratings nonetheless. The Giants held the 49ers west coast offense to seven points. But scored only three, in suffering their second straight loss.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
5|$|The Colts {{suffered}} their largest {{margin of}} defeat, 34–14, against the Green Bay Packers the following week. Manning threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns (for {{the second time}} in his career; the first was on September 30, 2001 against the New England Patriots). The next week the Colts went into Tennessee on <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> to face the 6–0 Titans. They led 14–6 in the third quarter, but Tennessee scored 25 unanswered for a 31–21 victory and almost assured the Colts they would not win the AFC South division title {{for the first time in}} six seasons. At 3–4, the Colts opened up November with their annual showdown against the New England Patriots on Sunday Night Football. Tied at 15 in the 4th quarter, Manning set up Adam Vinatieri for a 52-yard field goal that proved to be the winning points in an 18–15 victory. Manning completed 21-of-29 passes for 254 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Colts were 4–4 halfway through the season and still alive in the AFC playoff race.|$|E
50|$|The Raiders {{began their}} 2008 {{campaign}} {{at home against}} their AFC West rival, the Denver Broncos, {{in the second game}} of <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football's</b> doubleheader.

In the second quarter, the Raiders continued to trail as kicker Matt Prater got a 26-yard field goal, while FB Michael Pittman got a 3-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Oakland got even more black and blue as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson, while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders finally got on the board as QB JaMarcus Russell completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie. Denver ended its rout with RB Selvin Young's 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run. Oakland would close the game with Russell's 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry.|$|R

5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games.

Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams.

Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson on the first play from scrimmage in the game, {{and went on to}} help lead the Eagles to a 59–28 victory. Vick was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame asked for his game jersey to display after he became the first player to pass for three touchdowns and rush for two touchdowns {{in the first half of}} a game. In a game later in the season against the New York Giants, Vick led a fourth-quarter rally to erase a 21-point deficit. He scored three touchdowns to tie the game with under two minutes left. DeSean Jackson returned the Giants' last punt of the game for a touchdown to win the game for the Eagles as time expired. Vick finished the season with 3,018yards passing, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions with a passer rating of 100.2. He had 100 carries for 676yards and nine touchdowns.

5|$|The first NFL {{game for}} the Jets, as the leagues {{finalized}} their merger in 1970, was also the first-ever <b>Monday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> game, a 31–21 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Three weeks later, they played the Colts {{for the first time}} since the Super Bowl. The Jets lost both the game and Namath, who fractured his wrist and was lost for the season as the Jets fell to a record of 4–10, the worst mark yet of the Namath era. They did not have a winning record again until 1981. After six years with the team, wide receiver George Sauer, a major contributor offensively, retired on April 16, 1971. Namath was injured again in a 1971 preseason game in Tampa, and missed much of the season. He returned on November 28 against the San Francisco 49ers and threw three touchdown passes; the Jets lost by three points. The Jets finished the season at 6–8. In 1972, Namath had one of the best days of his career against the Baltimore Colts: he completed 15 of 28passes for 496yards and six touchdowns. Despite Namath's performance, John Madden's Oakland Raiders eliminated the Jets from contention in their second-to-last regular season game. New York finished the season with a record of 7–7.|$|E
