5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when the station was built along the Erie Railroad. The station served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day. The station was {{populated}} by fishermen {{on their way to the}} lake, but has been the site of several accidents. These calamities include a derailed <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> in 1843 and a fatal accident between the train line and several mules and their owner in 1855. The station became part of Metro-North in 1983, when the service was created. The station was listed under a revitalization plan in 2005 to help serve its commuters.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1935, {{an express}} meat train from Liverpool to London {{was brought to}} a halt at Kings Langley due to a {{defective}} vacuum brake. Due to a signalman's error a <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> ran into its rear. Wreckage spread across all four lines, {{with the result that}} a few minutes later the Camden to Holyhead freight collided with the debris, followed a few seconds later by the Toton to Willesden coal train. All four lines were blocked for some time and the driver of the <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> was killed. Contemporaneous newsreel footage shows the aftermath of the four-fold accident.|$|E
25|$|A branch was {{installed}} to allow trains {{from the former}} Southern Railway to access to the West Coast Main Line and vice versa: in summer the London Midland and Scottish Railway ran from {{as far north as}} Glasgow to the South Coast. Through trains in the steam era changed locomotives here. From the 1920s there was a United Dairies depot on the site of a former dairy farm here, which up until the late 1970s had regular <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> deliveries.|$|E

25|$|Wyeth {{was born}} in Jersey City, New Jersey. His mother Caroline Pyle, Howard Pyle’s niece, was {{interested}} in the Wyeth family, flirted with some of them, and married Nathaniel C. Wyeth. He had four brothers, John, David, N. Convers, and Andrew, and one sister, Melinda who died very young. A fifth brother (the oldest), Newell died with his grandfather in 1945 when their car stalled on a railroad crossing near their home and they were struck by a <b>milk</b> <b>train.</b> Wyeth married once, to Rona Morrow, and later divorced. Catherine Wheeler was his partner for seventeen years, from his mid-thirties on.|$|E
25|$|The {{downward}} trend continued, with the 1950s seeing more industries {{served by the}} railroad go out of business. By 1959, all mail service via the Sussex Branch stopped, and the last <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> ran in November 1964. The last passenger train departed from Branchville on July 10, 1966; the last passenger train from Newton on July 13, 1966; and the last passenger train on the entire branch pulled away from Andover on October 2, 1966. By 1969, all track formerly owned by the Sussex Railroad was completely out of service, {{with the exception of}} the former South Vernon extension, which is still used today by the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway on its way to Syracuse and Utica, New York.|$|E
25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The <b>Milk</b> <b>Train</b> Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she lit a cigarette, and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E

2500|$|Bankhead {{earned her}} {{greatest}} acclaim for two classic roles she originated: Regina in Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes and Sabina in Thorton Wilder's The Skin of our Teeth. At the Algonquin Hotel, Bankhead left prominent impressions upon playwrights such as Zoe Akins and Rachel Crothers. Crothers later wrote the play Everyday for Bankhead, and Akins patterned {{the character of}} Eva Lovelace in her play Morning Glory on Bankhead. She became good friends with Tennessee Williams, who was immediately struck upon meeting her, describing her as [...] "result from the fantastic crossbreeding of a moth and a tiger". Williams wrote four female roles for her, Myra Torrance in Battle of Angels, Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, Princess Kosmonopolis in Sweet Bird of Youth, and Flora Goforth in The <b>Milk</b> <b>Train</b> Doesn't Stop Here Anymore. A song in the 1937 musical I'd Rather Be Right, [...] "Off the Record", contains the line [...] "I'm not so fond of Bankhead, but I'd love to meet Tallulah". The Bankhead Theater (Livermore Performing Arts Center) has her namesake.|$|E
60|$|Sherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, {{his pale}} cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light {{when the call}} for work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The {{inspector}} was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded {{to him by the}} <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> {{in the early hours of}} the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.|$|E
50|$|On 6 January 1932, a <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> and {{a freight}} train {{collided}} at Didcot East.

The <b>milk</b> <b>train</b> had overrun a danger signal.|$|E
50|$|Carnation {{built an}} {{evaporated}} milk factory in Dumfries {{that opened in}} 1935, eventually constructing three units producing tin cans, evaporated milk and latterly Coffeemate. The original factory had private siding access to the station's good yard, which gave access for <b>milk</b> <b>trains</b> to the facility, in both delivering raw product as well as distribution to London. <b>Milk</b> <b>trains</b> stopped in the mid-1970s. The US-parent company was bought by Nestle in 1985, after which {{a decline in the}} facility began. CoffeeMate production ceased in 2000, after which the site was fully redeveloped as an industrial estate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951 a new creamery {{was opened}} at Green Grove, near Felinfach, by the Milk Marketing Board. It started {{operation}} on 10 May 1951 {{as a single}} siding and as well as processing milk it served as a concentration point for conveyance of liquid milk to London and other large population centres. <b>Milk</b> <b>trains</b> ran {{seven days a week}} to Lampeter, the milk continuing from there to Carmarthen attached to passenger trains from Aberystwyth before attaching to other <b>milk</b> <b>trains</b> from other lcoations in West Wales (such as from Whitland and Carmarthen creameries).|$|R

50|$|From 1863 the Somerset and Dorset Railway {{ran through}} the town until 1966 when it was {{dismantled}} {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe. The railway goods yard gave <b>milk</b> <b>trains</b> access to the private sidings of the local creamery. Started in 1913 by local farmers to produce cheddar cheese and pasteurised milk, it was taken over by the Milk Marketing Board in 1937. <b>Milk</b> <b>trains</b> ceased in 1966 on closure of the line, with the creamery remaining in operation until 2000 under successor Dairy Crest.

5000|$|From 1910, Nestlé had a creamery in the town, {{which for}} a period was {{contracted}} to produce Carnation condensed milk.

After <b>milk</b> <b>trains</b> ceased in 1965, the railway track was lifted and the railway station fully closed. The factory closed in 2003, and since demolition in 2006, has been redeveloped as housing and a light industrial estate, although the old loading ramp from street level up to the factory floor is still in situ.|$|R

5000|$|Centerville's first Southern Pacific Railroad {{station was}} nothing more than a boxcar, {{functioning}} in that capacity from May 1909 to September 1910. In that month the current wooden structure was opened. It was one of sixty Type 23 stations built by Southern Pacific, and its cost was under $5,000 USD. [...] The station was a busy one during its early years, handling both freight and passenger traffic, including two to three daily <b>milk</b> <b>trains.</b> By the mid-1920s, automobile traffic began to grow, and the <b>milk</b> <b>trains</b> were discontinued. Passenger service ended on March 29, 1940. The Railway Express Agency continued shipping to and from the station until 1958. The station was completely closed on September 30, 1961.|$|R
