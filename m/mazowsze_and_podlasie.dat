50|$|In Poland, bonfires are {{traditionally}} and still enthusiastic burned during Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, Pentecost day and Saint John Night as Sobótki, ognie świętojańskie(Śląsk, Małopolska, Podkarpacie), Palinocka (Warmia, Mazury, Kaszuby) or Noc Kupały (<b>Mazowsze</b> <b>and</b> <b>Podlasie)</b> on June 23/24.On 23 and 24 June, according to ancient custom, an immense number of Polish persons {{of both sexes}} repaired to {{the banks of the}} San (river), Vistula and Odra river, to consult Fate respecting their future fortunes, jumping through a fire on the Eve of Saint John's was a sure way to health. The leaping of the youths over fire (sobótka) must be a custom derived from remote antiquity. Jan Kochanowski, who died in 1584, mentions it in a song from an ancient tradition. Varro and Ovid relate, that in the Palilia, celebrated in honour of the goddess Pales, on 20 April, the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, the young Romans leaped over burning bundles of hay. In modern Italy, this kind of saltation is continued by the name of Sabatina, though Pope Sergius III prohibited.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} and examine an elasticity of relations between production factors (land, labour, capital) and incomes gained by using the above mentioned factors at farms of four macro-regions FADN, i. e. : Pomorze and Mazury, Wielkopolska and Śląsk, <b>Mazowsze</b> <b>and</b> <b>Podlasie,</b> Małopolska and Pogórze. Production function models of Cobb-Douglas (C-D) were assessed for every macro-region for years: 2010, 2011 and 2012. The survey shows that in all macro-regions as well as in all surveyed years, elasticity coeffi cient of total net added value was higher than 1 which means increasing incomes in scale. Increase of net added value in three among four surveyed macro-regions depended mainly on land factor while labour input (excluding <b>Mazowsze</b> <b>and</b> <b>Podlasie</b> where labour factor was important) and fi xed assets factor appeared to be of least importance...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the relationship between total, average and marginal human factor productivity {{and the level of}} education of a farm manager in Poland. The study was carried out based on unit empirical data from the monitoring of the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and covered the four Polish FADN macro-regions: Pomorze & Mazury, Wielkopolska & Śląsk, <b>Mazowsze</b> & <b>Podlasie</b> <b>and</b> Małopolska & Pogórze. The study involved the Cobb-Douglas production function method. Using the relationship between total production (in PLN) of a farm and the aggregated production factors such as total labour input in AWU (Annual Work Unit), area of arable land (ha) and fixed assets (PLN), labour productivity was determined based on the level of education of the farm manager. The results indicate that the flexibility of production in relation to the labour factor was significantly higher in the group of farms managed by farmers with higher-level education in two out of four analysed macro-regions and on a national scale. In addition, human capital approximated by the level of education had a positive effect on the average and marginal productivity of the analysed farms...|$|R

Kluk was a priest/scientist who lived in the eighteenth century in Ciechanowiec, a small town located on the border of <b>Mazowsze</b> <b>and</b> <b>Podlasie.</b> The author divides the consonant system into two groups, distinguishing features that are consistent with a nationwide standardized language of {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century, and other linguistic features that do not fit in the standard literature of the period. In the opinion of the author, the second features have a lot in common with the Polish language of the Eastern Borderlands (especially the north-east), and are layered with regional variations of Polish-language eighteenth-century literature.
