40|$|Introduction {{to special}} issue on {{accounting}} applications. By publishing these papers {{together in one}} issue of Management Science we wish to accomplish the dual purpose of exposing <b>management</b> <b>scientists</b> to the application of their discipline to important accounting problems and of allowing <b>management</b> <b>scientists</b> and accountants to interact in areas of research and problem-solving, thus stimulating the interest of readers who {{are concerned with the}} problems of accounting. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>management</b> <b>scientists</b> need to {{understand}} how models are used by managers and correspondingly apply appropriate criteria to their own efforts. Types of models used by managers are discussed. Then an example is presented of how such understanding can be used to evaluate the worth of formal analysis. The evidence points to patterns of quite different inquiry and response by managers than have typically been envisioned by <b>management</b> <b>scientists.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this brief}} comment on {{education}} and management science I will focus my attention on what the universities should provide, recognizing (1) that this is {{only one part of}} a <b>management</b> <b>scientist's</b> education and (2) that not all <b>management</b> <b>scientists</b> fit into a single mold. In general the universities seem to be doing excellently in teaching the basic mathematical skills. They have developed courses covering all phases of mathematical programming, statistics, and stochastic processes. They are doing increasingly well in offering computer science courses relevant to management science (e. g. simulation, file manipulation). By contrast, truly relevant courses in the behavioral sciences seem to be much less well developed as are courses centered on the philosophy and practice of management science and operations research. ...|$|R
