40|$|NTF 2 is a cytosolic protein {{responsible}} for nuclear import of Ran, a small Ras-like GTPase {{involved in a}} number of critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, chromatin organization during mitosis, reformation of the nuclear envelope following mitosis, and controlling the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Herein, we provide evidence {{for the first time that}} translocation of the mammalian NTF 2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to collect Ran in the GDP form is subjected to regulation. Treatment of mammalian cells with polysorbitan <b>monolaurate</b> was found to inhibit nuclear export of tRNA and proteins, which are processes dependent on RanGTP in the nucleus, but not nuclear import of proteins. Inhibition of the export processes by polysorbitan <b>monolaurate</b> is specific and reversible, and is caused by accumulation of Ran in the cytoplasm because of a block in translocation of NTF 2 to the cytoplasm. Nuclear import of Ran and the nuclear export processes are restored in polysorbitan <b>monolaurate</b> treated cells overproducing NTF 2. Moreover, increased phosphorylation of a phospho-tyrosine protein and several phospho-threonine proteins was observed in polysorbitan <b>monolaurate</b> treated cells.

40|$|PURPOSE. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the relative lipase production {{of a range of}} ocular bacterial isolates and to assess the efficacy of glycerol <b>monolaurate</b> (GML) in inhibiting this lipase production in high lipase-producing bacteria without affecting bacterial cell growth. METHODS. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Corynebacterium spp. were inoculated at a density of 106 /mL in varying concentrations of GML up to 25 μg/mL for 24 hours at 378 C with constant shaking. Bacterial suspensions were centrifuged, bacterial cell density was determined, and production of bacterial lipase was quantified using a commercial lipase assay kit. RESULTS. Staphylococcus spp. produced high levels of lipase activity compared with P. acnes and Corynebacterium spp. GML inhibited lipase production by Staphylococcal spp. in a dosedependent manner, with S. epidermidis lipase production consistently more sensitive to GML than S. aureus. Glycerol <b>monolaurate</b> showed significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) lipase inhibition above concentrations of 15 μg /mL in S. aureus and was not cytotoxic up to 25 μg /mL. For S. epidermidis, GML showed significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) lipase inhibition above 7. 5 μg /mL. CONCLUSIONS. Lipase activity varied between species and between strains. Staphylococcal spp. produced higher lipase activity compared with P. acnes and Corynebacterium spp. Glycerol <b>monolaurate</b> inhibited lipase production by S. aureus and S. epidermidis at concentrations that did not adversely affect bacterial cell growth.

40|$|Genome-wide {{transcriptional}} profiling {{studies of}} the response of Staphylococcus aureus to cell wall-active antibiotics {{have led to the}} discovery of a cell wall stress stimulon of genes induced by these agents. msrA 1, encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase, is a highly induced member gene of this stimulon. In the present study we show that msrA 1 induction by oxacillin is common to all methicillin-susceptible strains studied but did not occur in two homogeneous and two heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains. However, msrA 1 was induced by vancomycin and/or d-cycloserine in methicillin-resistant strains. Lysozyme and lysostaphin treatment did not induce msrA 1 expression. Oxacillin-induced msrA 1 expression was enhanced by ca. 30 % in a SigB+ derivative (SH 1000) of the SigB-defective RN 450 (NCTC 8325 - 4) strain. msrA 1 expression was not affected in mutants in the global regulatory systems agr and sar. Glycerol <b>monolaurate,</b> an inhibitor of signal transduction, inhibited the oxacillin-induced transcription of msrA 1 and other cell wall stress stimulon member genes, vraS and dnaK. These observations suggest that the cell wall stress stimulon is induced by inhibition of the process of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and the inhibitory effects of glycerol <b>monolaurate</b> indicate that gene expression is dependent on a signal transduction pathway...|$|E

40|$|A {{pathogenicity}} gene {{has been}} identified in Leptosphaeria maculans, the ascomycetous fungus that causes blackleg disease of canola (Brassica napus). This gene encodes isocitrate lyase, {{a component of the}} glyoxylate cycle, and is essential for the successful colonization of B. napus. It was identified by a reverse genetics approach whereby a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance was inserted randomly into the L. maculans genome. Twelve of 516 transformants tested had reduced pathogenicity on cotyledons of B. juncea and B. napus, and 1 of these 12 had a deletion of the isocitrate lyase gene, as well as an insertion of the hygromycin resistance gene. This mutant was unable to grow on fatty acids, including <b>monolaurate,</b> and the isocitrate lyase transcript was not detected. When the wild-type gene was reintroduced into the mutant, growth on <b>monolaurate</b> was restored and pathogenicity was partially restored. L. maculans isocitrate lyase is produced during infection of B. napus cotyledons, while the plant homologue is not. When 2. 5 % glucose was added to the inoculum of the isocitrate lyase mutant, lesions of sizes similar to those caused by wild-type isolate M 1 developed on B. napus cotyledons. These findings suggest that the glyoxylate pathway is essential for disease development by this plant-pathogenic fungus, as has been shown recently for a fungal and bacterial pathogen of animals and a bacterial pathogen of plants.

40|$|G 12 and G 13 are insufficiently {{characterized}} pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins. Here, {{we describe}} the isolation of G alpha 12 from rat brain membranes. G alpha 12 was purified to apparent homogeneity by three steps of conventional chromatography, followed by two cycles of subunit-exchange chromatography on immobilized G subunits. Purified G alpha 12 bound guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate slowly and substoichiometrically. For isolation of functionally active G alpha 12, it was mandatory to use sucrose <b>monolaurate</b> as a detergent. Comparative studies of both rat-brain-derived members of the G 12 subfamily revealed differences in the affinity of G alpha 12 and G alpha 13 for G beta gamma. G alpha 12 required a higher Mg 2 + concentration for AlF 4 - -induced dissociation from immobilized G beta gamma than did G alpha 13. In addition, the G 12 subfamily members differed in their sedimentation velocities, as determined by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. Analysis of sedimentation coefficients revealed a higher tendency of G 12 to form supramolecular structures in comparison to G 13 and other G-proteins. These G 13 structures were stabilized by sucrose <b>monolaurate,</b> which in turn may explain the necessity for this detergent for purification of functionally active G alpha 12. Despite these distinct biochemical characteristics of G 12 and G 13, both purified G-proteins coupled to a recombinant thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) receptor reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles.
