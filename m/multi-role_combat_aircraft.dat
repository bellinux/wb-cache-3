5|$|AFVG (standing for Anglo-French Variable Geometry) was a 1960s {{project for}} {{supersonic}} <b>multi-role</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a variable-geometry wing, jointly developed by British Aircraft Corporation in the United Kingdom and Dassault Aviation of France.|$|E
5|$|While {{funding for}} the UKVG in the United Kingdom was seriously restricted, the British {{government}} sought to find partners {{in the form of}} NATO members, promoting the concept of creating and procuring a common NATO strike aircraft. In July 1968, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. This memorandum eventually led to the launch of the multinational <b>Multi-Role</b> <b>Combat</b> <b>Aircraft</b> (MRCA) project, which in turn went on to produce a variable geometry aircraft to perform strike, reconnaissance, and interception missions {{in the form of the}} Panavia Tornado.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) {{produced}} 232 Block 30/40/50 F-16s on a production line in Ankara under license for the Turkish Air Force. TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt {{in the mid-1990s}} and 30 Block 50 from 2010. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India had selected the F-16IN for its Medium <b>Multi-Role</b> <b>Combat</b> <b>Aircraft</b> procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would be built in India. In May 2013, Lockheed Martin stated there were currently enough orders to keep producing the F-16 until 2017.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{military}} <b>multi-role</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> need {{an emergency}} power system (EPU) to maintain back-up power supply for all normal and degraded flight modes. The reason for this requirement is that modern <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> are designed with built-in relaxed or negative stability. Inability of the Flight Control System to perform continuous, corrective control surface actuation, due to loss of power supply or other causes implies instantaneous departure with loss of A/C. An emergency system {{needs to have a}} quick response and provide high power, electrical or hydraulic or combined, to a low weight and volume for considered time Different EPU systems have been tried over the years, hydrazine (monopropellant) driven turbines, compressed air and all-electric battery systems are dominating in existing applications. Gas generator systems however show advantages, but hydrazine for example is both toxic and carcenogenic. The operation of coming electrical weapons demands short bursts of very high power. The requirement of power, from this emerging field of applications, is conveniently fulfilled by tailoring of the EPU/APU systems approach. A small stored energy based system can also be the power source solution for electrical weapons in medium UAV’s. FMV has since 1999 performed a study of an EPU system based on stored energy together with a turbine solution. A novel gas generator system has been developed and demonstrated which is both a user and environmental friendly. The work-performing gas is generated from catalytically enabled and supported combustion of medium concentration hydrogen peroxide and methanol. The concept was evaluated by performing a feasibility study in three phases between 1999 and 2007. This paper will present the work performed and results from these three phases. The paper covers both the results from initial studies of different EPU system concepts/solutions and from the demonstrator programs of two turbine concepts where the second concept also incorporated a working novel hydrogen peroxide/methanol gas generator. Specific focus will be given to this novel gas generator concept which operates with a mixture of medium concentration hydrogen peroxide and methanol. The hydrogen peroxide is catalytically decomposed into steam/water and free oxygen that are used to combust the added methanol by a combustion catalyst into a high temperature (~ 600 C) working gas...|$|R

25|$|Desperate {{for a new}} {{high-tech}} combat aircraft, between late 1990 and 1993 the PAF {{evaluated the}} European Panavia Tornado MRCA (<b>multi-role</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft)</b> and rejected it. The Mirage 2000E and an offer from Poland for the supply of MiG-29 and Su-27 were also considered but nothing materialised. In 1992 the PAF again looked at the Mirage 2000, reviving a proposal from the early 1980s to procure around 20–40 aircraft, but again a sale did not occur because France {{did not want to}} sell a fully capable version due to political reasons. In August 1994 the PAF was offered the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Sweden, but again the sale did not occur because 20% of the Gripen's components were from the U.S. and Pakistan was still under U.S. sanctions.|$|E

According to the Regional Director-Business Development Dave Potter, the Typhoon's multi-role capabilities allow it to replace the MiG-29N. Other contenders include Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale and JAS 39 Gripen NG.

2500|$|The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito was a British {{twin-engine}} shoulder-winged <b>multi-role</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The crew of two, {{pilot and}} navigator, sat side by side.

The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the [...] "Mossie" [...] to its crews. Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to roles including low to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, neutral countries, through enemy-controlled airspace. A single passenger could ride in the aircraft's bomb bay when it was adapted for the purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Dassault Rafale won the Indian MMRCA {{competition}} to supply 126 medium <b>multi-role</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> to the Indian Air Force. In April 2015, the inabilities to conclude negotiations on contractual obligations [...] led the Modi government {{to transform the}} acquisition into a G2G procurement for 36 aircraft in flyaway condition to equip 3 squadrons of the Indian Air Force. Defense analysts have voiced concern that equipment procurement requirements which were defined 2 decades ago are {{out of sync with}} current requirements and the future nature of air-combat. Air forces of advanced Western nations, especially US & France, are reorganizing their air forces with increase in space-based assets and down-sizing of fleets of manned combat aircraft. Autonomous drones have become the preferred platform for high-risk missions over enemy territory in both high and low intensity conflict zones. At present, NATO uses aerial reconnaissance drones to monitor the borders of Europe and US uses maritime surveillance drones in the Western Pacific and unmanned combat drones in missions against low-value and unsophisticated targets in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Defense white-papers published in OECD countries show that use of combat and reconnaissance pilotless vehicles (like the flight-tested Dassault nEUROn and Northrop Grumman X-47B UAVs or the Boeing X-37 robotic spacecraft) will become widespread in the years ahead.|$|E
