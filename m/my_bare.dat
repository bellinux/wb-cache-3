500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with <b>my</b> <b>bare</b> hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E

She reveals that a conviction might be difficult as her husband has been dead for five months. While {{coming to terms with}} her husband's death as a hit and run victim, Margaret joins a church group clearing litter from roadsides. There she meets Glynis Holloway (Hannah Gordon), whose husband has also recently died. The two become good friends. Confiding to a priest, Father Blakey (William Osborne), Margaret pledges vengeance for Victor's death, vowing [...] "If they ever find the bastard who was at the wheel of that car I swear I'll kill him, with <b>my</b> <b>bare</b> hands if I have to, and they can do what they like with me". Father Blakey tells Margaret of his hope that one day she finds the strength to forgive the person responsible.|$|E

500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting <b>my</b> <b>bare</b> back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Richard {{views the}} album as her take on medieval literature, but calls her lyrics less [...] "literal" [...] than {{contemporary}} pop music. Lyrically, she portrays {{herself as an}} embattled queen in acts of guarding, fighting, surrendering, and conquering. She murmurs in the intro to [...] "Warfaire", [...] "I fight a battle every day, against discouragement and fear ... I must forever be on guard." [...] The track's misspelled title is taken from the television series Game of Thrones. On [...] "Goliath", she declares, [...] "I faced the Beast with <b>my</b> <b>bare</b> hands". [...] "Gleaux" [...] is an eccentric spelling of [...] "glow", referring to what the narrator wants {{to do with her}} lover to see each other in the night. [...] "Tug of War" [...] concludes a conflicted quest for dominance at the expense of a lover's power. On the power ballad [...] "Break of Dawn", Richard promises herself and a love interest that he will [...] "never see the break of dawn". Richard, who wanted the album to end on a [...] "hopeful" [...] note, said that the title track [...] "speaks of the fairytale. That naïveté. That moment where you felt anything is possible." [...] According to Laurie Tuffrey of The Quietus, the song concludes Goldenhearts lyrical arc with a [...] "wistful retrospect" [...] on a relationship that began with Richard's declaring her [...] "champion" [...] on [...] "In the Hearts Tonight" [...] and shifted to [...] "Tug of War", where she became [...] "her own champion".|$|E

2500|$|The {{ease with}} which the Reform Parliament had passed the Poor Law Act of 1834, its refusal to pass a Ten-Hour Bill and the {{contrast}} between the zeal with which the New Poor Law was brought in and the failure to enforce the Factory Act of 1833 were powerful arguments that only the fundamental political changes sought by Chartism would produce a Parliament which paid more than lip-service to the interests of the working classes. [...] Consequently, the anti-poor law movement became almost inextricably linked with Chartism. The leaders of the Anti-Poor Law movement differed in their response to Chartism. [...] Oastler would {{have nothing to do with}} it, and continued to speak only on the Poor Law and on Factory Reform (but to audiences of largely Chartist tendencies). [...] He called upon his hearers to exercise their right to bear arms (but not to bring them to meetings); he also warned (but was careful not to threaten) that a social cataclysm would result if the government were to further oppress the poor. [...] J R Stephens, a Methodist minister who had been prominent in both the Factory Reform and Anti-Poor Law movements addressed Chartist meetings, giving much the same advice as Oastler, and was a delegate to the National Convention, but later said [...] "I would rather walk to London on <b>my</b> <b>bare</b> knees, on sharp flint stones to attend an Anti-poor Law meeting, than be carried to London in a coach and six, pillowed with down to present that petition - the [...] "national petition" [...] to the House of Commons" [...] Stephens was less prudent than Oastler in his speeches and failed to persuade those coming to his meetings to leave their guns at home. [...] Consequently, when the Government cracked down on Chartist activity after the Todmorden Riots (in which - despite the insinuations of the Manchester Guardian - Fielden could not be implicated), Stephens was imprisoned for eighteen months for unlawful assembly. [...] Fielden deprecated the use of force, or any hint of the use of force, and hence advised against the acquisition of arms. [...] Initially, he had striven to prevent Anti-Poor Law meetings alienating non-Chartist sympathisers by discussing other Chartist demands, but at the height of the Chartist agitation of 1838 he abandoned this position. Instead, thinking that the poor law would never be reformed until parliament had been remodelled along the lines called for by the Chartists' National Petition, he spoke at Chartist meetings and urged Chartists to concentrate on the fundamental reforms they sought and not allow themselves to be bought off with concessions on the Poor Law and Factory Reform. With the failure of the National Petition, and the consequent drift of Chartism away from 'moral force' to 'physical force', (which Fielden could not support) he reverted to his original position; that (once again) the Anti-Poor Law movement had a better chance of success if it remained distinct from more general Chartist agitation.|$|E
