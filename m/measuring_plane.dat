40|$|Probe {{compensation}} {{is an essential}} element in near-field measurements when accurate fields are required. However, the accuracy of probe compensation techniques heavily depends on {{the accuracy of the}} used probe factor. A major source of errors in the probe factors used in scalar and vector {{compensation is}} the truncation error. Increasing the size of the <b>measuring</b> <b>plane</b> offers a solution, but is not practical in most cases. First, not every near-field scanner allows to measure a large area. Second, increasing the size of the <b>measuring</b> <b>plane</b> also increases the measurement time. In this paper, a novel method to reduce the influence of truncation errors on probe compensation is presented. The method uses auxiliary dipoles to extrapolate the measured near-field values of the reference structure(s) outside the <b>measuring</b> <b>plane.</b> The accuracy and effectiveness of the method is evaluated for both scalar and vector compensation algorithms. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - The {{system has}} an {{objective}} (16) {{assigned to a}} light source, to produce a light beam (B), at least one grid (19) arranged in the beam path on the objective. A first imaging system (22) images the grid on a <b>measuring</b> <b>plane</b> (F 3) intersecting or at least partly coinciding with the body surface. A second imaging system (32) receives reflected or scattered light. A CCD camera (36) is used to take the image produced by the second imaging system. USE - Optical determination of shape of surface of a body. Reproduction of 3 D shape of surface of body.

40|$|Experiments {{were done}} at the TOPFLOW {{facility}} of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf to establish a CFD-grade database on the condensation of steam bubbles injected into sub-cooled upwards vertical pipe flow. Bubble condensation has {{to be considered in}} Nuclear Reactor Safety Research, e. g. if sub-cooled boiling or bubble entrainment caused by ECC injection occurs. Bubble size distributions are important, since the condensation rate is proportional to the interfacial area density. To develop and validate closure models for CFD codes experimental data with high resolution in space and time are required. The steam was injected via orifices in the pipe wall located at different distances from <b>measuring</b> <b>plane.</b> 1 mm and 4 mm injection orifices are used to vary the initial bubble size distribution. The variation of the distance between the location of the gas injection and the <b>measuring</b> <b>plane</b> allows investigating the evolution of the flow along the pipe. Pressure, steam and water flow rates and the sub-cooling were also varied. Measurements are done using wire-mesh sensors and thermocouples. Data on averaged void fraction, radial gas volume fraction profiles, profiles of the gas velocity and bubble size distributions in dependency of the L/D ratio are available. 1...|$|E

30|$|The sensor {{location}} {{correction factor}} is mainly {{determined by the}} air velocity distribution at the <b>measuring</b> <b>plane.</b> Using a single correction factor for all the locations will produce certain errors in the calculation of the average air velocity from the sensor readings. An effective method for obtaining the appropriate sensor location correction factor is to measure the air velocity at the sensor location. Then determine the average air velocity to get the correction factor for the specific site before a sensor is mounted. However, airflow merging and splitting can affect the air velocity distribution significantly, and the measurements {{need to be made}} to update the correction factor if any air course changes occur upstream or downstream.|$|E

The application of two linear ultrasound transducer arrays in an orthogonal arrangement facilitates the flow field {{measurement of the}} in-plane velocity components in a <b>measuring</b> <b>plane</b> of 67 × 67 mm resolved into a grid of 24 × 24 vectors. Advanced processing techniques like the application of segmented arrays and the simultaneous operation of multiple elements of the transducer arrays allow high imaging frame rates and concurrently a high spatial resolution.
