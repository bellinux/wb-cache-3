5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and {{submillimeter}} (70–500μm) photometry {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted these studies. Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> homogenous.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, the Arabs {{could not}} achieve a decisive result. The main Khazar army {{remained}} intact and a constant threat, since like all nomad forces {{it was not}} dependent on cities for supplies. Coupled {{with the fact that}} his rear was still insecure, al-Jarrah was forced to abandon any attempt at capturing Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus. From there he asked for reinforcements from Yazid, but although the Caliph promised to send more troops, he failed to do so. The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, but he seems to have led another campaign north (which <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> the true date of the Balanjar campaign). In response, the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus, but in February 724, al-Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes that lasted for several days. Al-Jarrah followed up his success by capturing Tiflis, whose inhabitants were obliged to pay the kharaj but received a charter of rights in return. This campaign brought Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty, and al-Jarrah became the first Muslim commander to march through the Darial Pass in the process. This expedition secured the Muslims' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial, while conversely it gave the Muslim army a second invasion route into Khazar territory.|$|E

5|$|In 721/722, {{the main}} {{phase of the}} war began. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars {{launched}} an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the mostly Syrian army of the local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February/March 722. In response, Caliph Yazid II (r. 720–724) sent {{one of his most}} celebrated generals, al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah, with 25,000 Syrian troops north. Al-Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovered Derbent and even advanced on Balanjar. The Khazars tried to defend their capital by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons, but the Arabs broke it apart and stormed the city on 21 August 722 or 723. Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north. Despite their success, however, the Arabs had not yet defeated the main Khazar army, which like all nomad forces was not dependent on cities for supplies. The continuing threat of the Khazar army forced the Arabs to abandon any attempt to capture Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus. The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, but he seems to have led another campaign north (which <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> the Balanjar campaign).

25|$|Early on, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that, while Mar Saba manuscript <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> a genuine old manuscript, it could well contain an ancient or medieval forgery, based on canonical texts. Nor is it established whether the letter derives from Clement of Alexandria or not. Linguistic indications speak for authenticity. However, differences of substance compare with Clement's other writings have been noted. The text contains none of the errors typical in the manuscript tradition. Charles Murgia (1975) followed Quesnell's allegations of modern forgery with further arguments.|$|E
25|$|This patriarchal {{backlash}} <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> {{the result}} of lack of employment opportunities for men and more women entering the workforce which has altered traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes. Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, {{the disintegration of the}} peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system. Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that femicide is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of crystalline water ice, and possibly ammonia ice {{may indicate that}} a renewal mechanism {{was active in the}} past on the surface of Orcus. Ammonia so far has not been detected on any TNO or icy satellite of the outer planets other than Miranda. The 1.65μm band on Orcus is broad and deep (12%), as on Charon, Quaoar, Haumea, and icy satellites of giant planets. On the other hand, the crystalline water ice on the surfaces of TNOs should be completely amorphized by the galactic and Solar radiation in about 10 million years. Some calculations indicate that cryovolcanism, which {{is considered one of the}} possible renewal mechanisms, <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> possible for TNOs larger than about 1000km. Orcus may have experienced at least one such episode in the past, which turned the amorphous water ice on its surface into crystalline. The preferred type of volcanism may have been explosive aqueous volcanism driven by an explosive dissolution of methane from water–ammonia melts.|$|E

500|$|Few viewers {{picked up}} on the notion that the events of this episode were not {{necessarily}} factual. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said [...] "In the closing scene Frohike tells Mulder and Scully that the whole story was something he read in a crummy magazine.

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz later noted that, while {{parts of}} [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> factual, the majority is not actual canon.

[...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of {{the wrong end of}} the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to stimulate more {{attractive}} football, the international football association FIFA, has introduced several new rules over the past decades.

Our theoretical results indicate that the new rule will not change the behavior of the teams when they are equally powerful.

500|$|In a [...] "Concluding Note" [...] to Grandison, Richardson writes: [...] "It {{has been}} said, {{in behalf of}} many modern fictitious pieces, in which authors have given success (and happiness, as it is called) to their heroes of vicious if not profligate characters, that they have {{exhibited}} Human Nature as it is. Its corruption <b>may,</b> <b>indeed,</b> <b>be</b> exhibited in the faulty character; but need pictures of this be held out in books?

[...] Before Fielding died in Lisbon, he included a response to Richardson in his preface to Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{the journal}} African Primates {{published}} three papers by primatologists on the false potto. Colin Groves affirmed {{that it was}} probably distinct from the potto and Simon Bearder cited it {{as an example of}} unrecognized taxonomic diversity in lorisids, but Esteban Sarmiento compared the new taxon to specimens of the potto and found that the alleged distinctive traits of the false potto in fact fell within the range of variation of the potto, and that the false potto was probably not even a species distinct from Perodicticus potto. In 2000, primatologist B.S. Leon agreed that the false potto was not distinct from the subspecies Perodicticus potto potto, but noted that various forms of potto were distinct enough from each other that there <b>may</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>be</b> more than one species of potto. Opinions since then have been divided: a 2003 compilation of African primate diversity concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the false potto is a distinct species, the primate chapter of the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World, written by Groves, listed Pseudopotto as a genus but noted that it was [...] "controversial"; and Schwartz continued to recognize the false potto as a genus in 2005. Also in 2005, primatologist David Stump reviewed some of the distinguishing features of Pseudopotto in the context of studying variation among pottos, and found that some but not all of the false potto's traits were found in some pottos, mainly western populations (subspecies potto).|$|E
