50|$|The time {{frequency}} approach for <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis {{can be divided}} into two broad categories: linear methods and the quadratic methods. The difference is that linear transforms can be inverted to construct the time signal, thus, they are more suitable for signal processing, such as noise reduction and time-varying filtering. Although the quadratic method describes the energy distribution of a signal in the joint {{time frequency}} domain, which is useful for analysis, classification, and detection of signal features, phase information is lost in the quadratic time-frequency representation; also, the time histories cannot be reconstructed with this method.|$|E
50|$|The {{short-term}} Fourier transform (STFT) and the Gabor transform are two algorithms {{commonly used}} as linear time-frequency methods. If we consider linear time-frequency analysis {{to be the}} evolution of the conventional FFT, then quadratic time frequency analysis would be the power spectrum counterpart. Quadratic algorithms include the Gabor spectrogram, Cohen's class and the adaptive spectrogram. The main advantage of time frequency analysis is discovering the patterns of frequency changes, which usually represent the nature of the signal. As long as this pattern is identified the <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> associated with this pattern can be identified. Another important use of time frequency analysis is the ability to filter out a particular frequency component using a time-varying filter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that induction <b>machine</b> <b>faults</b> introduce phase and/or amplitude modulation of the stator currents. Hence, demodulation of the stator currents is of high interest for induction <b>machines</b> <b>faults</b> detection and diagnosis. The demodulation techniques can be classified into mono-dimensional and multi-dimensional approaches. The monodimensional techniques include the synchronous demodulator, the Hilbert transform, the Teager energy operator and other approaches. The multi-dimensional approaches include the Concordia transform and the Principal Component Analysis. Once the demodulation has been performed, demodulated signals are further processed in order to measure failure severity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of these demodulation techniques for eccentricity and broken rotor bars faults detection...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{technique}} for detecting faults is the time-frequency analysis technique. For a rotating machine, the rotational {{speed of the}} machine (often known as the RPM), is not a constant, especially not during the start-up and shutdown stages of the machine. Even if the machine is running in the steady state, the rotational speed will vary around a steady-state mean value, and this variation depends on load and other factors. Since sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine which are strongly related to its rotational speed, {{it can be said}} that they are time-variant signals in nature. These time-variant features carry the <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> signatures. Consequently, how these features are extracted and interpreted is important to research and industrial applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>fault</b> {{diagnosis}} {{is a field}} of mechanical engineering concerned with finding faults arising in machines. A particularly well developed part of it applies specifically to rotating machinery, {{one of the most}} common types encountered. To identify the most probable faults leading to failure, many methods are used for data collection, including vibration monitoring, thermal imaging, oil particle analysis, etc. Then these data are processed utilizing methods like spectral analysis, wavelet analysis, wavelet transform, short term Fourier transform, Gabor Expansion, Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), cepstrum, bispectrum, correlation method, high resolution spectral analysis, waveform analysis (in the time domain, because spectral analysis usually concerns only frequency distribution and not phase information) and others. The results of this analysis are used in a root cause failure analysis in order to determine the original cause of the fault. For example, if a bearing fault is diagnosed, then it is likely that the bearing was not itself damaged at installation, but rather as the consequence of another installation error (e.g., misalignment) which then led to bearing damage. Diagnosing the bearing's damaged state is not enough for precision maintenance purposes. The root cause needs to be identified and remedied. If this is not done, the replacement bearing will soon wear out for the same reason and the machine will suffer more damage, remaining dangerous. Of course, the cause may also be visible as a result of the spectral analysis undertaken at the data-collection stage, but this may not always be the case.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} several decades, {{induction}} machine condition monitoring have received increasing attention from researchers and engineers. Several induction <b>machine</b> <b>faults</b> detection techniques have been proposed {{that are based on}} vibration, temperature, and currents/power monitoring, etc. Motor current signature analysis is a cost-effective method, which has been widely investigated. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that mechanical and electrical induction <b>machine</b> <b>faults</b> can be effectively diagnosed using stator currents demodulation. Therefore, this paper proposes to investigate the use of demodulation techniques for bearing faults detection and diagnosis based on stator currents analysis. If stator currents are assumed to be mono-component signals, the demodulation techniques include the synchronous demodulator, the Hilbert transform, the Teager energy operator, the Concordia transform, the maximum likelihood approach and the principal component analysis. For a multi-component signal, further preprocessing techniques are required such as the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) or the Ensemble EMD (EEMD). The studied demodulation techniques are demonstrated for bearing faults diagnosis using simulation data, issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach-based simulation tool, and experiments on a 0. 75 kW induction machine test bed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{nondestructive}} <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> detection, based on evaluation of acoustic machine signatures, is presented. Various mechanical defects of rotary machines can {{be reflected in}} altered acoustic signatures. Such phenomena can be often perceived by skilled human operators who can also explain the type of defect merely based on slightly changed acoustic signature. The proposed method is based on psychoacoustic modeling of human auditory perception. For the purpose of <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> detection, the gammatone filterbank is applied in preprocessing of acoustic signals. Filtered signals are then rectified, and features are calculated as mean values of rectified signals. A set of features represents an extracted machine signature. In order to evaluate the current machine state, extracted features are compared to the database of normal machine states. If values of the extracted features exceed statistically determined upper and lower margins, a possible <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> is indicated. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study, where the quality of commercially produced compressors is predicted.

40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} {{signals of}} the running machine contain non-stationary components. Usually, these non-stationary components contain abundant information on machine faults. In this paper, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method for the <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis is proposed. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and Hilbert transform are key parts of the Hilbert–Huang transform method. The EMD will generate a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). By applying EMD method and Hilbert transform to the vibration signal, {{we can get the}} Hilbert spectrum from which the faults in a running machine can be diagnosed and fault patterns can be identified. The practical vibration signals measured from roller machine with eccentric and friction faults are analysed by the Hilbert–Huang transform and Fourier transform in this paper. Finally, HHT’s performance in rolling <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> detection is compared with that of the Fourier transform. The comparison results have shown that the HHT is superior than the Fourier transform in <b>machine</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostics. The different failure characteristic frequencies can be distinguished in the component of different orders of IMF, and the time and frequency of failure characteristic frequency appearance can be clearly reflected in the Hilbert spectrum...|$|E
