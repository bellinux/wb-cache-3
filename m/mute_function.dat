5000|$|... 2007 heralded the {{introduction}} of the Nemesis RS series combos, which offered Edge control to add tube-style grit (noticeable at high gain/high volumes), Pre-/Post-EQ selector for the DI output, Footswitch for Enhance Bypass and <b>Mute</b> <b>functions,</b> and changed the cabinets back to void-free plywood construction from the cellulose composite material. The following year (2008) the RS-series heads became available separately as the RS-400 (400 watts at 4 ohms) and the RS-700 (700 watts at 2 ohms). This Nemesis RS series was specifically designed [...] "with rock bassist firmly in mind...to address the needs of players who want an aggressive, mix-cutting sound."

40|$|International audienceWe present {{synthetic}} {{and real}} data examples processed using a depth imaging method for long-offset multichannel seismic data via the intercept-time-slowness (τ-p) domain. The refracted and reflected {{information contained in}} the wavefield is processed simultaneously. Our scheme uses common midpoint data that is transformed to the τ-p domain and mapped to the depth-slowness (z-p) domain using a downward continuation algorithm. The velocity function for downward continuation may be obtained iteratively from the diving ray trajectory within the slowness-depth wavefield or estimated using an independent method. Horizontal events within the z-p wavefield are isolated by applying a <b>mute</b> <b>function</b> corresponding to the downward continuation velocity function in the z-p domain. Stacking the resulting wavefield gives an image trace that may be superimposed on the velocity function to form a velocity image. Following testing on synthetic data the method is applied to two long-offset marine seismic streamer data sets with offsets up to 18 km, from the northeast Atlantic margin. These examples demonstrate {{the potential of the}} method to obtain velocity images in difficult geological locations, where conventional processing has been less successful...|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's thesis aims at {{designing}} the circuit diagram of {{input and output}} circuits of analog to digital and, simultaneously, digital to analog convertors intended to process audio signals and their realization. The introductory theoretical part deals with the qualitative requirements concerning the way low-frequency audio amplifiers process audio signal. The following part focuses on the active component base selection {{with respect to the}} achievement of the required quality and parameters as defined in the task description. The next part comprises the design of the input and output amplifier circuit diagram itself and then the realization of their functional samples. The input amplifier provides some of the functions which are common with high quality sound production; such as attenuator activation, input signal phase inversion, and <b>MUTE</b> <b>function.</b> This amplifier consists of three logically sequenced parts. A preamplifier with approximately 60 dB amplification and with high separation between a useful signal and noise stands for the first part; a high-pass filter that suppresses interfering signals stands for the second part; and an output amplifier ensuring the balanced output for the analog to digital convertor stands for the last part. The output amplifier, which is connected to the digital to analog convertor, is also embraced of three logically sequenced parts. The first one includes the input amplifier which transforms the input balanced signal to the unbalanced one. The second part is created of an output amplifier that has the line level balanced output...|$|E
40|$|Source to {{receiver}} distances {{employed in}} seismic data acquisition have been steadily increasing {{and it is}} now common to work with data acquired with more than 10 km of offset. Sub-basalt exploration and seismic undershooting are just two applications where long-offset reflections are valuable. However, such reflections are often subjected to muting to avoid NMO stretch artifacts, thus causing a loss of valuable information. It is therefore of interest to find ways to avoid the distortions caused by the standard NMO correction and to retrieve these portions of the recorded wavefield for a better use in the processing. To this end we develop a non-stretch NMO correction based on a wavelet estimation and on a iterative procedure of partial NMO correction and deconvolution. To drive the corrections we make use of 4 th order traveltime curves, that further extend the offset range of usable reflections. Then we estimate time and space variant wavelets, by means of SVD along the sought traveltimes, that become the desired output for the deconvolution trying to retrieve the original shapes of the partially stretched wavelets. We test our method on a synthetic gather presenting time and offset varying wavelets and noise. This example demonstrate that our new algorithm effectively limits the stretching associated with the NMO correction and enables the recovery of those portions of the stacked sections which are typically ruled out by the <b>mute</b> <b>function</b> in the standard NMO correction...|$|E

This model was available in charcoal black and blue. The audio and AM sections were identical to the third-generation Herald, and the FM sections were a new design with the FM front end now made in-house; the FM and audio sections went on {{to appear in the}} RP37 VHF Herald. Initially, AF117s were used in the AM tuner, but from serial number 13001, BF194/195s were adopted (the FM sections used these silicon devices from the outset). This set introduced an ISM (inter-station <b>muting)</b> <b>function</b> for the FM band, operated by a switch that also enabled the AFC function, which eliminates the loud noises typically heard when tuning across the FM band. There are now four station markers, which can be placed anywhere within the band (which still only reached 101 MHz).|$|R

3000|$|In reality, {{the number}} of tags N is unknown to the reader and the reader should {{estimate}} it using an appropriate tag estimation function, utilizing the (aforementioned) collected statistics {{at the end of}} each frame. The tag estimate, namely [...] N, is again utilized in computing the appropriate frame sizes to be used for the subsequent frames. In this scenario, frame size L is adjusted according to [...] N at appropriate time instances (e.g., on a frame-by-frame basis) during the identification process. Consequently, the so-called dynamic FSA (DFSA) protocol [6, 7, 15 – 17] is more realistic than FSA. However, in this work, we assume that the frame size is fixed throughout the identification process in order to facilitate our discussion, because our interest is focused primarily on the optimal parameter configuration of the FSA protocol for a given N, i.e., we consider the situation after N or [...] N is determined. In addition, we assume that each tag transmits its ID once every frame, regardless of whether the previous transmissions were successful; i.e., the <b>muting</b> <b>function</b> [6, 7] is not available. Therefore, the results herein are not restricted only to the FSA protocol.|$|R

40|$|The {{immune system}} in the {{intestine}} represents a unique environment that can quickly respond to harmful pathogens, but it remains tolerant to antigens from food and commensal bacteria. This balance between protective immunity and tolerance is largely dependent on the mononuclear phagocytes in the intestine, such as macrophages. Intestinal macrophages, unlike other macrophage populations in the body, are hypo-responsive to stimuli although they originate from fully responsive blood monocytes. The intestinal environment seems to instruct monocytes to <b>mute</b> their <b>function</b> upon arrival to the gut in order {{to adapt to the}} antigen-rich environment.

40|$|Epidermal {{differentiation}} in Arabidopsis thaliana aerial organs involves stomatal lineage development. Lineages {{derive from}} meristemoids, which arise from asymmetric divisions of protodermal cells. Each meristemoid divides repeatedly in an inward spiral before it transits to a guard mother cell (GMC) {{that produces the}} stoma, {{leaving a trail of}} surrounding stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) that eventually differentiate into endoreplicated pavement cells. MUTE is a bHLH transcription factor that is expressed in late meristemoids and drives their transition to GMCs. Loss-of-function mute mutants are stomata-less dwarf plants with arrested lineages, in which stunted putative SLGCs surround a halted meristemoid. We analysed <b>MUTE</b> <b>functions</b> using a chemically inducible system for mute- 3 complementation based on conditional MUTE expression in its normal domain. Continuous induction from germination produced stomata-bearing, normal-sized plants with viable mute- 3 seeds. In 2 -week-old mute- 3 cotyledons, meristemoids appeared to retain their identity and synchronously formed stomata in response to induced MUTE expression. However, arrested SLGCs were not complemented: many produced stomata, leading to stomatal clusters, and others remained unexpanded and diploid. In contrast, non-lineage pavement cells, which are under-endoreplicated in mute- 3, expanded and increased their ploidy level upon induction, showing that the lack of response of SLGCs is specific to this arrested cell type. Leaf phenotypic mosaics include wild-type lineages and adjacent mute- 3 lineages, whose meristemoids and putative SLGCs remained arrested, indicating that the role of MUTE in SLGC fate is strictly lineage-autonomous. These results show that timely MUTE expression is essential to prevent stomatal fate in SLGCs and to promote their differentiation as pavement cells. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|In seismic data processing, Normal Moveout (NMO) {{correction}} {{is applied}} to common mid point (CMP) gathers to simulate a zero-offset trace from traces recorded at variable source to receiver offset x. Then, properly NMO corrected CMP gathers can be the input {{for a number of}} different tasks: AVO analysis, residual statics computation, and most commonly, stacking to produce a seismic image with higher S/N ratio and with attenuated multiple reflections. The NMO correction in exploration seismology is a common practice. The wavelet stretching and the event duplication resulting from this procedure are removed from the seismic data by the application of <b>mute</b> <b>functions,</b> computed {{on the basis of the}} maximum stretch threshold allowed. Usually, enough data are still available after the mute, because stretching and event superposition have a limited influence at depths of interest in exploration seismic. This is not the case in near surface seismic, where the NMO stretch and the corresponding mute constitute a major problem especially for shallow reflections. Indeed, not only the mute limits the stack potential in enhancing the S/N ratio, but sometime this effect is so severe that all the recorded seismic data at shallow times are zeroed-out. Various methods have been proposed in literature to overcome the problem of the NMO stretching. Trickett (2003) made a synthetic and clear review of the different methodologies that have been proposed since 1975, with an accurate description of the main drawbacks each of the proposed algorithms is affected by. The stretch-free stacking proposed by Trickett (2003) replaces the NMO correction and stacking with a single inversion step to zero-offset. As pointed out by the author, no NMO corrected CMP gather is formed by this procedure, limiting the method’s applicability. Our procedure tries to overcome this limitation suggesting, at the same time, an alternative way to estimate the zero-offset stack trace. This new algorithm was applied to synthetic and several field data-sets with satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDesigns {{are derived}} for three error-handling {{functions}} in the compact disc player: the first decoder in the error corrector, the interpolator and the <b>muter.</b> All three <b>functions</b> are performed by autonomous processes, which interact with their environment by communication only. The designs are derived in a transformational way, {{which means that the}} ultimate design is derived by applying a series of correctness-preserving transformations on an initial design. Initial designs are fairly direct translations of functional specifications. A functional way of programming is applied. An automaton is conceived as a function from states to behaviours (processes), where states are equivalence classes of communication histories. A program then consists of two parts: a function definition of the automaton and an application of that function to the initial state. States are very useful in the verification of program transformations, since they facilitate the definition of a function mapping the states of the transformed automaton onto the states of the original one...|$|R
