50|$|A monthly magazine, <b>Model</b> <b>Trains,</b> was {{published}} by Airfix from January 1980. The magazine included especially good articles aimed at newcomers to the hobby and also included many articles about modelling US and Continental European railways, as well British prototype railways. The publication of <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> continued for some years after Airfix ceased ownership in 1981. A change in the editorial team saw the original <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> editorial staff launch a new title as Scale Trains, in April 1982. A slight name change followed in April 1984, as Scale <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> following the final issue of <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> in December 1983. Scale <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> ran until June 1995, when a new publisher was found and the magazine was relaunched in 1995 as <b>Model</b> <b>Trains</b> International, the November/December issue being issue number 1. It continues to be published.|$|R

50|$|This method uses power {{models in}} {{software}} to track VM energy usage on each significant hardware resource, using hypervisor-observable hardware power states. Joulemeter can also solve the power capping problem for VMs which will reduce power provisioning costs significantly. The largest power consuming subsystems in computer servers are the processor, memory and disk. Servers also have idle energy consumption which sometimes can be large, {{but it is}} static {{and it can be}} measured. Power models are presented for each of subsystems CPU, memory and disk in reference in detail. This power model is the core technique for Joulemeter. Figure 4 in reference shows the block diagram of Joulemeter where System Resource & Power Tracing module reads the full server CPU, disk and power usage. The VM resource tracking module tracks all the work load using hypervisor counters. The base <b>model</b> <b>training</b> module implements the learning methods described in as well as refinement module. The energy calculation module finally takes the out of base <b>model</b> <b>training</b> module and model refinement module to output the VM energy usage using the energy equations described in reference.|$|E
