5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

He spoke {{about it on the}} Late Show with David Letterman after coming out of rehab and continued {{to do so in the}} years following. [...] "There was an energy that was created," [...] he says of the time when he was addicted, [...] "a character that was created, that no doubt benefited <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> there was a stage where it all began to crumble around me." ...|$|E

500|$|Handling the film's {{special effects}} were KNB EFX GROUP and the Moving Picture Company (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used {{different}} techniques. [...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of {{me from the}} shoulders up. They created <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together." ...|$|E
500|$|He was an {{original}} {{owner of a}} Holiday Inn franchise near Orlando, Florida, which is today the Seralago Hotel & Suites Main Gate East. Glenn's business partner was Henri Landwirth, a Holocaust survivor who became his best friend. He remembered learning about Landwirth's background: [...] "Henri doesn't talk about it much. It was years before he spoke about it with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> only because of an accident. We were down in Florida during the space program. Everyone was wearing short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirtseveryone but Henri. Then one day I saw Henri at the pool and noticed the number on his arm. I told Henri {{that if it were}} me I'd wear that number like a medal with a spotlight on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Called Jack by his family, Carradine's {{childhood}} was turbulent. His parents divorced and repeatedly remarried; {{he was born}} to his mother's second marriage of three, and his father's first of four. At the time of Carradine's parents' marriage, his mother already had a son by her first husband, whom John adopted. John Carradine planned a large family, but after his wife {{had a series of}} miscarriages, he discovered she had numerous illegal abortions without his knowledge. This rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term. Against this backdrop of marital discord, Jack almost succeeded in committing suicide by hanging at the age of five. He said the incident followed his discovery that he and his older half-brother Bruce, who had been adopted by John, had different biological fathers. Carradine added, [...] "My father saved <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> confiscated my comic book collection and burned it– which was scarcely the point." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria {{got along}} with Gold, who was lukewarm about working with him, but after a woman Azaria had [...] "worked with in New York got really furious with him because he said he'd work with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> didn't", Gold sent him out for auditions. He made his {{television}} debut with {{a role in the}} pilot episode of the 1986 ABC comedy-drama series Joe Bash, with Peter Boyle. His part—a one-line role as the police officer Maldonado—was edited out before the show was broadcast, although the role secured him admission to the Screen Actors Guild. Azaria appeared in the TV film Nitti: The Enforcer, about the gangster Frank Nitti, and appeared in the failed pilot Morning Maggie alongside Matthew Perry, with whom he became good friends. He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom Family Ties in 1988 in which he had one line, and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of Growing Pains. Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame. In Los Angeles, Azaria was trained by acting coach Roy London. Between acting jobs he performed as a stand-up comedian, and worked as a bartender for a catering firm.|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E

2500|$|He later {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home. During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him. Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, he cried out, [...] "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" [...] He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked {{him to the door}} of the Black Cloister. [...] "This day you see <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> not ever again," [...] he said. His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther's education.|$|E
2500|$|Jennie Wedge {{announced}} on 1 February 1929 {{that she would}} be seeking to have her marriage to Wedge annulled. She was reported as saying: [...] "If he is mentally unbalanced I am sorry. But I could never live with him again. I would be in constant fear of my life. We had been so happy all week long until this sudden threat of his to kill <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> himself". On February 2, 1929 Jennie Wedge applied in the superior court to have her marriage to Wedge annulled {{on the basis of his}} [...] "unsound mind" [...] and his fraud, alleging that Wedge [...] "falsely and fraudulently" [...] represented that he had sufficient funds to provide for her immediate needs, whereas he had insufficient funds to pay the $100 bill for their honeymoon suite. Also on February 2, 1929 Wedge was charged with insanity at his own request, with the papers signed by his son, Hugh. On February 5, 1929 Wedge was declared insane and committed to the Napa State Hospital, [...] "an insane asylum" [...] in Napa, California.|$|E

2500|$|During a 2013 {{interview}} with Chicago Pride, on being {{asked if he}} has kept in contact {{with any of the}} other Cobra actors, he replied [...] "No. There were few I was close with - but mostly the civil suit, and the pressure Bryan Kocis put on the other models, not {{to have anything to do}} with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Bryan's death pretty much put an end of the friendships I'd garnered there. From what I've heard some have moved on nicely enough. Some aren't even alive anymore. I randomly saw one in a San Francisco gym during Pride a few years ago but thought better of stopping him to say hello. It's a chapter of my life I don't like to revel in." [...] He stated in the interview that the trend in the pornographic industry is toward unprotected, unsafe sex. He has warned about the social impact on gay and bisexual men's decision making, especially when in the heat of lust and passion, while influenced by alcohol or drugs. He appeared in a short interview for his film Big Easy in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stewards}} {{investigated the}} collision between di Grassi and Félix da Costa but elected {{to take no}} action towards the Audi Sport ABT driver, and di Grassi spoke to Félix da Costa after the ePrix. Di Grassi claimed Félix da Costa [...] "didn't know how to race today" [...] {{and that he was}} passed [...] "very harshly" [...] but admitted that he had not seen the latter after overtaking him: [...] "That's the price of starting at the back, there's always these risks. That generated the crash and then this chaotic domino effect that really was a day to forget." [...] Félix da Costa blamed di Grassi for causing the collision, claiming the latter was [...] "out of character" [...] and did not believe that he would attempt such a manoeuvre. He added while di Grassi was intelligent, he steered earlier than expected which forced him to be squeezed into the wall: [...] "He was being very clever - I overtook him and he was staying there. But one lap to another his mind just switched, he tried to overtake me like 20 times in five corners. He was all over <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he was just trying desperate moves everywhere." [...] Di Grassi lamented the ePrix and said his team would forget about the event because of him going from being the fastest driver in the second practice session to having a poor qualifying lap and would recover for the next race of the season.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
