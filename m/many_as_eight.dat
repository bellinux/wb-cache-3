5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden.|$|E

5|$|As <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> males {{will be at}} a mating site, {{staying in}} close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

25|$|The {{setting up}} of the Canara bank seemed to stimulate {{co-operative}} banking elsewhere in the district. Between 1909 and 1917, six co-operative banks came into being, and during the decade immediately after the First World War (1914–18), South Canara gave birth to as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> banks.

50|$|By that time, major film studios, {{which had}} {{formerly}} been based in New York, were already well-established in California, and many Broadway actors had been enticed to travel west to Hollywood to make sound films, including Ann Harding, Aline MacMahon, Helen Twelvetrees, Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, and Leslie Howard. Francis, signed {{to a contract}} with Paramount Pictures, also made the move and created an immediate impression.

50|$|The {{bolt pattern}} determines {{the number and}} {{position}} of the mounting holes to allow the wheel to be bolted to the hub. As the bolts are evenly spaced, the number of bolts determines the pattern. For example: smaller cars have three (Citroën 2CV, Renault 4, some Peugeot 106s and Citroën Saxos). Compact cars may have four bolts. Most United States passenger cars have five bolts. Pickup trucks, large SUVs, and armored vehicles may have <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> five, six, <b>eight,</b> or ten. It is not unheard of to find vehicles with even more, such as enormous coal mining transporters that may have twelve.|$|R
60|$|The minute {{two-armed}} glands on {{the valve}} were also {{affected by the}} solution; for they now contained several, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> six or <b>eight,</b> almost spherical masses of translucent matter, tinged with yellow, which slowly changed their forms and positions. Such masses were never observed in these glands in their ordinary state. We may therefore infer that they serve for absorption. Whenever a little water is expelled from a bladder containing animal remains (by the means formerly specified, more especially by the generation of bubbles of air), it will fill the cavity in which the valve lies; and thus the glands {{will be able to}} utilise decayed matter which otherwise would have been wasted.|$|R
25|$|The first 30 {{sports were}} {{announced}} by the Singapore National Olympic Council on 10 December 2013 on the sidelines of the 27th SEA Games in Myanmar.

25|$|In {{order to}} resolve its {{problems}} the studio stopped production for two months. Collins then refocused {{the company on}} producing niche-themed pornography, and discontinued some series that had more ambiguous themes and were not selling well. The firms logo and box-cover art was also redesigned and simplified. It hired a new DVD authoring contractor, and launched a new PR campaign. The company {{then went back to}} producing as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> new titles a month. Production was also halted for a month in early 2004 when the studio joined the moratorium on filming caused by Darren James's HIV infection.|$|E
50|$|Symposia are an {{important}} part of the ICES work programme, not least because they foster the broadening of the diversity of scientists who participate in ICES activities. ICES welcomes proposals for stimulating symposia on topics that are fundamental to the science components of the ICES Strategic Plan including (a) understanding the physical, chemical, and biological functioning of marine ecosystems, (b) understanding and quantifying human impacts on marine ecosystems, including living marine resources, and (c) evaluating options for sustainable marine-related industries, particularly fishing and mariculture. ICES generally sponsors, either itself or in collaboration with other organizations, at least two, and sometimes <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seven or <b>eight,</b> scientific symposia in a calendar year.|$|R
5000|$|I was shewn Dr Taylor's new meeting-house, {{perhaps the}} most elegant one in all Europe.

60|$|My South American {{relative}} was so engrossed by his {{grounds and}} their curious occupants, that I hardly gave him credit at first for having any interests outside them. That he had some, and pressing ones, was soon borne in upon {{me by the}} number of telegrams which he received. They arrived at all hours, and were always opened by him with the utmost eagerness and anxiety upon his face. Sometimes I imagined that it must be the Turf, and sometimes the Stock Exchange, but certainly he had some very urgent business going forwards which was not transacted upon the Downs of Suffolk. During the six days of my visit he had never fewer than three or four telegrams a day, and sometimes <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seven or <b>eight.</b>|$|R
25|$|His most salacious {{case was}} {{his defense of}} Jeff and Kathy Willets in 1991. The Willets were accused of {{operating}} a sex business out of their home. Rubin argued in their defense that Kathy Willets was driven to prostitution by nymphomania brought on by side-effects of the antidepressant, Prozac, forcing her to need sex with as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> men daily. Her husband, a deputy sheriff, was impotent and videotaped his wife's sex acts {{as a form of}} therapy. Despite this original defense, both were convicted. The lawyer for the prosecution was Joel T. Lazarus, who shortly afterward was appointed a judge.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut and stacked. When colliers selected a site for the hearth, they stacked the wood into a conical shape by standing the sticks on end around a central chimney. The dangerous job of firing and tending these hearths belonged to the collier {{and one or two}} helpers. These men usually managed as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> or nine hearths at one time. To keep the fires smoldering, fires were carefully controlled 24 hours a day for ten days to two weeks -the time needed to produce the charred wood or charcoal.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee was {{the only}} armored vessel that the Confederate Navy put into lower Mobile Bay, but there were plans for others. Buchanan hoped {{that he would have}} as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight,</b> {{including}} a pair of floating batteries, with which he could challenge the Union blockade, attack Pensacola and perhaps even recapture New Orleans. The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however. Some of the projected fleet were completed in time to defend Mobile after the lower bay had been lost, but they were not there when most needed. Nevertheless, they imparted some urgency to Farragut's plans to maintain the blockade.|$|E

50|$|The FHL {{awarded a}} new {{franchise}} {{to play in}} Southwest Pennsylvania to begin play in the 2014-15 season, named the Southwest Pennsylvania Magic (shortened to SWPA Magic). The Magic were {{to play at the}} Rostraver Ice Garden in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania bringing the league to five teams and a return to Pennsylvania after the folding of the Williamsport Outlaws in the 2012-13 season. In an interview, commissioner Don Kirnan stated he hoped to see <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seven to <b>eight</b> teams in the FHL by the next season. However, after playing one game in which they lost 10-2 to the Berkshire Battalion, the Magic's membership in the league was revoked due to financial problems.

6000|$|Now, {{what can}} the {{fair-minded}} inquirer say to such a story <b>as</b> that--one of <b>many,</b> {{but for the moment}} we are concentrating upon it? Was Mr. Crookes a blasphemous liar? But there were very <b>many</b> witnesses, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> sometimes <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> at a single sitting. And there are the photographs which include Miss Cook and show that the two women were quite different. Was he honestly mistaken? But that is inconceivable. Read the original narrative {{and see if you can}} find any solution save that it is true. If a man can read that sober, cautious statement and not be convinced, then assuredly his brain, is out of gear. Finally, ask yourself whether any religious manifestation in the world has had anything like the absolute proof which lies in this one. Cannot the orthodox see that instead of combating such a story, or talking nonsense about devils, they should hail that which is indeed the final answer to that materialism which is their really dangerous enemy. Even as I write, my eye falls upon a letter on my desk from an officer who had lost all faith in immortality and become an absolute materialist. [...] "I came to dread my return home, for I cannot stand hypocrisy, and I knew well my attitude would cause some members of my family deep grief. Your book has now brought me untold comfort, and I can face the future cheerfully." [...] Are these fruits from the Devil's tree, you timid orthodox critic? ...|$|R
