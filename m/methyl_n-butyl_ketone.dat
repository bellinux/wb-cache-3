This study was conducted to clarify the potentiating effect of aliphatic monoketones on the neurotoxicity of <b>methyl</b> <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> Rats were subcutaneously injected in the back with 4 mmol/kg/day of methyl ethyl ketone, methyl n-propyl ketone, methyl n-amyl ketone, or methyl n-hexyl ketone mixed with an equimolar dose of <b>methyl</b> <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> five days a week for 20 weeks. The maximum motor fibre conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves of the treated animals and controls. All the monoketones tested enhanced the neurotoxicity of <b>methyl</b> <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> Of the compounds tested, methyl n-hexyl ketone, which had the longest carbon chain, enhanced the neurotoxicity of <b>methyl</b> <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> most strongly.

The maximum conduction velocity of motor and sensory fibres and the motor distal latency of the tail nerves of rats were periodically examined in animals receiving repeated subcutaneous injections of 11 aliphatic monoketone or diketone compounds and their relatives for prolonged periods. A study of the comparative neurotoxicity of n-hexane, <b>methyl</b> <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> and their metabolites showed that 2, 5 -hexanedione was the most actively neurotoxic. Furthermore, a study of other symmetrical diketones with different carbon numbers showed that 2, 4 -pentanedione, which is structurally similar to 2, 5 -hexanedione, possessed a different type of neurotoxic activity than 2, 5 -hexanedione. Regarding aliphatic monoketone compounds, acetone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, and 2 -octanone were confirmed non-neurotoxic for the peripheral nervous system.

40|$|Despite the {{progress}} {{in our understanding}} of pathogeneses and the identification of etiologies of peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy remains common. Typically, attention to peripheral neuropathies resulting from exposure to envi-ronmental agents is limited relative to more commonly diag-nosed causes of peripheral neuropathy (diabetes and chemotherapeutic agents). Given that there are more than 80, 000 chemicals in commerce registered with the Environ-mental Protection Agency and that at least 1000 chemicals are known to have neurotoxic potential, very few chemicals have been established to affect the peripheral nervous system (mainly after occupational exposures). Awide spectrum of exposures, including pesticides, metals, solvents, nutritional sources, and pharmaceutical agents, has been related, both historically and recently, to environmental toxicant-induced peripheral neuropathy. A review of the literature shows that the toxicity and pathogeneses of chemicals adversely affect-ing the peripheral nervous system have been studied using animal models.

This elimination of 1 -butene {{can be regarded as}} a McLafferty-type rearrangement and since it bears similarity with the well-known Norrish II photochemical rearrangement of ketones, involving an intramolecular Á-hydrogen transfer due to an excitation of the carbonyl bond, we postulated that an excitation of the Li+ cationized ester carbonyl bond in Li+ adducts of fatty acid n-butyl esters is the trigger for the loss of 1 -butene in low-energy collisional activation. For the theoretical calculations using density-functional theory was considered because excited states can be treated by this approach. The results obtained on Li+ and Na+ cationized <b>methyl</b> and <b>n-butyl</b> acetate and <b>methyl</b> butyrate indicate that the inductive effect of Li+ is stronger than that of Na+ and that the ionic effect promotes less accumulation of negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen bound to Li+.

For elicitation of skin reactions, topical challenge with the compounds {{in olive oil}} or intradermal challenge with saline as the solvent was necessary. Topical challenge with the methacrylates in ethanol failed to elicit any allergic skin reactions because of their volatility. All sensitized animals responded strongly {{not only to the}} inducing methacrylate but also to the other methacrylates, showing that mutual cross-sensitivity had occurred. Since methyl methacrylate has been reported to be a potent sensitizer in humans, the guinea-pig model described here may be useful for screening products before marketing...|$|R
40|$|Two dual {{fluorescent}} receptors (1 and 2) for monosaccharides {{based on}} 4 -dialkylaminobenzanilides (alkyl= <b>methyl</b> and <b>n-butyl)</b> containing boronic acid {{group at the}} amido aniline were synthesized and their spectral properties were investigated. These receptors exhibited dual fluorescence with the long-wavelength band displaying strong solvent-polarity dependence, indicating the occurrence of the excited-state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). With increasing pH value in aqueous solutions, the hybridization of the boron atom changed from sp(2) to spa(3) inducing {{a decrease in the}} total fluorescence quantum yield. The experimental results indicated that the anionic form of the boronate group acted as an electron donor and the benzanilide-like charge transfer was promoted upon hybridization change. In the presence of monosaccharides, the boronic acid in 1 and 2 changed from neutral to anionic form. The intensity of the locally excited (LE) state emission decreased in the presence of sugars while a slight increase in the intensity at the charge transfer (CT) emission occurred. Based on the change in the CT to LE intensity ratios of 1 and 2 due to sugar binding, ratiometric fluorescent assays for monosaccharide sensing were established...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of raw {{nanotube}} materials {{produced by}} different methods is demonstrated. Depending {{on the production}} methods, tubes of different diameters can be produced. Purification of single wall carbon nanotubes produced by laser-oven and HiPco process is also discussed. Metal catalyzed oxidation at low temperature {{has been shown to}} selectively remove non-SWNT carbon and permit extraction of metals with concentrated HCl. These multi-stage purification methods have been investigated and the sample purity is documented by EDAX, ESEM, TGA, Raman and UV-vis-Nir spectroscopy. Covalent attachment of functional groups and molecules, including fluorine, <b>methyl,</b> <b>n-butyl</b> and n-hexyl groups, to the sidewalls of single wall carbon nanotubes has been achieved. Further fluorination study is done to investigate the effect of HF which is used as catalysts. Parallel fluorination experiments are performed on both laser-oven-grown and HiPco SWNTs. Larger diameter tubes, i. e. laser-oven-grown SWNTs, require higher fluorination temperatures. A limiting stoichiometry of C 2 F can be reach for Fluorotubes. Quantitative measurement of the alkylation was done by thermal gravimetric analysis. A mechanism involving electron transfer and effects of reaction temperature, solvents and steric effects of the alkyl groups are discussed. Prolonged exposure of small diameter SWNT ropes (diameters < 5 nm) to hot fuming sulfuric acid has been shown to grow super-ropes with approximately 10, 000 tubes in cross-section from rope sizes of approximately 10 tubes. This represents the largest rope sizes ever seen. Examination of the spectral properties of the SWNTs indicates that the roping occurs without changing the chemical state of the nanotubes. Acid intercalation of single wall carbon nanotubes is examined. Several super acids and strong acids are used to study the charge transfer and protonation effects on SWNTs. The degree of charge transfer is clearly correlated with the ability of acid to intercalate into the nanotube packs. A molecular mechanics calculation is used to optimize the proposed Fluorotube structures. This is the first theoretical work on the modeling of Fluorotubes. Results show that fluorine would like to add along the circumference of the tubes instead of going down the tube axis. The (1, 4) isomer has the lower total steric energy (TSE) between the two proposed Fluorotube structures, but the energy difference is small. Scanning tunneling microscopy has been used for atomic scale imaging of the fluorotubes. Significant band features are seen on fluorotubes, not on pristine carbon nanotubes. Butylated tubes have also been investigated by STM imaging. Instead of bands, relatively large, distinct features with spacings of about 50 A are observed. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated the (1, 4) isomer with bands around the tubes should be the preferred structure...|$|R
