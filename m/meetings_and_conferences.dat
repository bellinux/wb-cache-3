5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>conferences.</b> During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources, with a separate administration for radioecology, but the ministry's programs are underfunded and given low priority. In 1994 only 23% of budgeted funds were actually allotted to environmental programs. Many official <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>conferences</b> are held (more than 300 have been devoted {{to the problem of}} the Aral Sea alone), but few practical programs have gone into operation.

25|$|Lidia Zamenhof, {{daughter}} of L. L. Zamenhof, became a Bahá'í around 1925.

25|$|The {{impact of}} Indian laws on female {{foeticide}} and its enforcement is unclear. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India {{to assess the}} impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an premier research organization in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members Beti Bachao (save the daughter) badges during its <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>conferences.</b> However, a recent study by Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) argues that the 1994 PNDT Act may have had a small impact by preventing 106,000 female foeticides over one decade.|$|E

At the United Nations, he was an alternate to his colleague Abdel Hamid Abdel-Ghani, on the 14-member country Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. Distinguished members on the commission included Judge Philip Halpern of the United States. In January 1960, the sub-commission unanimously adopted a resolution condemning [...] "Anti-Semitism, Religious and Racial Prejudices", amongst {{the first to be}} adopted by a sub-commission at the World Organization.

2500|$|That same year, Reuss Ianculescu {{affiliated}} the LDDFR {{with the}} International Women's Suffrage Alliance In 1914, {{she and a}} small group of activists, including Maria Gavrilescu, Elena Meissner and Adela Xenopol supported a petition for women’s suffrage to be incorporated into the Constitution of the Kingdom of Romania, which was under debate. Though she tried to work with the Cercul Feminin Socialist (Socialist Feminine Circle) to forward the cause, they rejected aligning with LDDFR because they felt that her organization excluded working class women and was focused too heavily on educated women. During the war she gave lectures, attended <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>conferences</b> and tried to forward the cause of women’s political involvement. She declined an invitation by Aletta Jacobs to attend the 1915 International Congress of Women, believing that the congress was forcing women to choose pacifism over nationalism, and she fully pledged her loyalty to Romania.|$|E
2500|$|Also both Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, the {{governing}} {{body of the}} Bahá'ís, emphasized {{that there is no}} official Bahá'í endorsement of Esperanto as the international auxiliary language.

60|$|She now {{went about}} {{not only to}} all the places where she could make Ellen's {{amusement}} serve as an excuse, but to others when she could not coax or compel the melancholy girl. She was as constant at matinees of one kind as Boyne at another sort; {{she went to the}} exhibitions of pictures, and got herself up in schools of painting; she frequented galleries, public and private, and got asked to studio teas; she went to <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>conferences</b> of aesthetic interest, and she paid an easy way to parlor lectures expressive of the vague but profound ferment in women's souls; from these her presence in intellectual clubs was a simple and natural transition. She met and talked with interesting people, and now and then she got introduced to literary people. Once, in a book-store, she stood next to a gentleman leaning over the same counter, whom a salesman addressed by the name of a popular author, and she remained staring at him breathless till he left the place. When she bragged of the prodigious experience at home, her husband defied her to say how it differed from meeting the lecturers who had been their guests in Tuskingum, and she answered that none of them compared with this author; and, besides, a lion in his own haunts was very different from a lion going round the country on exhibition. Kenton thought that was pretty good, and owned that she had got him there.|$|E
