5|$|The Eastern Upper Peninsula Transportation Authority (EUPTA) {{operates}} the Drummond Island Ferry across the De Tour Passage {{in addition to}} two other ferries and the regional rural bus system for Luce and Chippewa counties. As part of the service between De Tour and Drummond Island, EUPTA operates up to three different vessels: the SS Drummond Islander, SS Drummond Islander III and the SS Drummond Islander IV. , fares start at $12 per car and increase based {{on the size of}} the vehicle transported, including a fuel surcharge. Passenger fares are $2 for adults and $1 for seniors or students; the vehicle driver's fare is included in the vehicle charge. Ferries leave Drummond Island at 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> from De Tour at 20 minutes to the hour, and run most of the day; some crossing times are only operated seasonally. M-134 is one of two highways in Michigan to use a ferry connection; the other is US10 between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E

Presently, Kitsap Transit operates a passenger-only ferry between Port Orchard and Bremerton. The Carlisle II has been designated as a floating museum. It is one of few mosquito fleet-era ferries operating on Puget Sound today. It runs every half-hour beginning on the hour and half-hour on the Port Orchard side and 15 and 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> on the Bremerton side. One-way fare is $2.00.|$|E

The clerk needs to know all the rules of Parliament and is {{responsible}} for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures two. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four <b>minutes.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> glass stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there is a division soon after another division, the middle hour glass will be turned and the bells will ring for two minutes.|$|E

50|$|As in the first, Southampton {{started the}} second period at a high tempo, {{immediately}} attacking the visitors' goal through Schneiderlin and, a few minutes later, Rodriguez, who almost added to his top-scoring tally in <b>the</b> 51st <b>minute.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, Gastón Ramírez was brought on for Cork, and he almost immediately made an impact; shortly after testing Foster with a free-kick, the Uruguayan midfielder played a pass into captain Lallana who could roll the ball underneath the West Brom goalkeeper to make it 1-0. The introduction of striker Saido Berahino by the visitors gave them some more pace up front, and Matěj Vydra also came on late in the game; both made impacts, but it was Shane Long who had {{the best chance to}} equalise in the last minute of normal time, but he was denied by a reaction save by the returning Boruc to keep Southampton in front.

If you lent an ear to the voice of the charmer that began by asking a crown to release you, and gradually came down to two-pence half-penny, you fell into a simple trap; the butt-end of a musket applied a posteriori, immediately after the transfer of property, convicted you of wilful waste.

60|$|On the {{following}} day, three-quarters {{of an hour}} before the meeting of the Board of Directors, old Mr Longestaffe called in Abchurch Lane. He was received very civilly by Miles Grendall, and asked to sit down. Mr Melmotte quite expected him, and would walk with him over to the offices of the railway, and introduce him to the Board. Mr Longestaffe, with some shyness, intimated his desire to have a few moments conversation with the chairman before the Board met. Fearing his son, especially fearing Squercum, he had made up his mind to suggest that the little matter about Pickering Park should be settled. Miles assured him that the opportunity should be given him, but that at the present moment the chief secretary of the Russian Legation was with Mr Melmotte. Either the chief secretary was very tedious with his business, or else other big men must have come in, for Mr Longestaffe was not relieved till he was summoned to walk off to the Board five <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> at which the Board should have met. He thought that he could explain his views in the street; but on the stairs they were joined by Mr Cohenlupe, and in three minutes they were in the Board room. Mr Longestaffe was then presented, and took the chair opposite to Miles Grendall. Montague was not there, but had {{sent a letter to the}} secretary explaining that for reasons with which the chairman was acquainted he should absent himself from the present meeting. 'All right,' said Melmotte. 'I know all about it. Go on. I'm not sure but that Mr Montague's retirement from among us may be an advantage. He could not be made to understand that unanimity in such an enterprise as this is essential. I am confident that the new director whom I have had the pleasure of introducing to you to-day will not sin in the same direction.' Then Mr Melmotte bowed and smiled very sweetly on Mr Longestaffe.|$|E

40|$|The hemodynamic effects {{following}} an oral dose of 19. 5 mg of nitroglycerine microencapsulated to give prolonged release {{have been studied}} in 10 patients during <b>the</b> 48 <b>hours</b> which followed <b>the</b> establishment of a myocardial infarct complicated by moderate left cardiac insufficiency. The right auricular pressure and the pulmonary capillary pressure diminished significantly 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> dose; 4 <b>hours</b> later <b>the</b> persistence of these effects is significant. A transient diminution of the systolic arterial pressure was observed initially (p < 0. 05). We observed that the cardiac index tends to increase although the increase did not attain the threshold of significance. No difference was observed in cardiac frequency, diastolic and mean arterial pressure or in the sytemic vascular resistance. We conclude that in the patient presenting an acute myocardial infarct, 19. 5 mg of NTG, microencapsulated to give prolonged release, essentially produces a reduction of the preload, with an early onset of action and a hemodynamic efficacy lasting at least 4 hours.
