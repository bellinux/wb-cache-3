5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
25|$|A {{recumbent}} bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat that some riders find <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> a saddle, especially riders {{who suffer from}} certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat steering.|$|E
25|$|Ballet flats, {{known in}} the UK as ballerinas, ballet pumps or skimmers, are shoes with a very low heel and a {{relatively}} short vamp, exposing much of the instep. They are popular for warm-weather wear, and {{may be seen as}} <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> shoes with a higher heel.|$|E

25|$|Greswell's next {{appearance}} in important cricket was for Ceylon, {{again in a}} one-day match with an England side {{on its way to}} Australia. The 1924–25 team's stopover in Colombo was no <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> their predecessors in 1920 had been: a virtually full Test side was dismissed for a total of 73, and Greswell took eight wickets for 38 runs.|$|E
25|$|In one variant, {{the woman}} may lift and {{slightly}} bend her legs, resting her {{feet flat on}} the mattress. This shortens the distance between the vagina and cervix, and may apply more friction to the area termed the G-Spot. The woman may find this <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the standard position, and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.|$|E
25|$|The riding {{position}} {{places the}} feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, {{so that the}} spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist {{the force of the}} wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability {{due to a lack of}} ground clearance.|$|E

25|$|Officers' camps accommodated, in {{addition}} to their officer-prisoners, a smaller number of other ranks prisoners known as orderlies, whose role was to act as servants to the officers and to perform menial tasks around the camp. Orderlies appreciated that their situation was safer and <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> that of their counterparts in soldiers' camps, and so, even when offered the opportunity, they generally did not try to escape, knowing that if recaptured they would be sent to far worse conditions.|$|E
25|$|The wealthier suburbs west of {{the city}} are located at {{slightly}} higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, Córdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity {{and the possibility of}} fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> in the capital.|$|E
25|$|At 29, McQueen got a {{significant}} break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis, Jr., {{from the film}} Never So Few after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> when driving at high speed—in this case in a jeep—or handling a switchblade or a tommy gun.|$|E

25|$|Egyptians {{looked at}} the afterlife as a {{continuation}} of this life, and believed {{that they would be}} able to enjoy many of the same activities. They also held the belief that {{they would be able to}} maintain the same social hierarchy. Egyptians, especially upper class Egyptians, were very preoccupied with making sure their life to come would be as comfortable, if not <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> <b>than</b> their life on earth. They took every precautionary measure to ensure that they would enjoy the same comforts. Excavated tombs were found to contain food, painted murals, statues, jewelry, and various other items.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the Il-18 was made on 18 August 1946, in a sixty-passenger configuration, even though the turbosuperchargers for its engines had not been fitted. To save time Sergey Ilyushin gave the order to {{commence}} flight tests without them. However, this proved to be in vain because the manufacturer's flight tests were not concluded until 30 July 1947 as the turbo-superchargers were not delivered in a timely manner. Other problems were the short time between overhauls for the ASh-73TKs, initially only 25 hours, and the disintegration of one engine on 25 June 1947. Flight characteristics were docile and the passenger cabin proved to be far <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> those of the Lisunov Li-2, the C-47 Skytrain or the Il-12. It had a comfortable margin of power that allowed it to continue to cruise if one or even two engines weren't running. Its engines were in short supply as they were needed to power the Tupolev Tu-4 {{and they were not}} yet reliable enough for economical use so the aircraft was canceled.|$|E

500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares {{noted that}} [...] "Scars" [...] {{exemplified}} Cyrus' equating of [...] "grown-up with joyless", {{adding that the}} track fails to find the [...] "emotional depth" [...] Cyrus was likely intending. She also described [...] "Take Me Along" [...] {{as one of the}} more [...] "overwrought ballads" [...] where Cyrus' delivery seemed <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> others on the record. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "Robot" [...] highlighted the theme of defiance and rebellion seen throughout Can't Be Tamed, specifically noting the lyrics [...] "Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark / I would scream but I'm just this hollow shell". The record closes with the twelfth track [...] "My Heart Beats for Love", which according to Ham, describes [...] "the more universal ideal of love for all"; Greenblatt also recognized the integration of organ instrumentation.|$|E
500|$|In July 1966, {{he began}} a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, a {{traditional}} rite of passage in his family. He arrived in Le Havre, where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions. Rules against drinking, smoking, and dating were strictly enforced. Most individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception: he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission. He initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when [...] "most of what I {{was trying to do}} was rejected." [...] He soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted. He was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the digs he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Those who yelled at him and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, under {{pressure}} from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Castle Seeon. The Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia. During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell {{out of her hand}} and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a [...] "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> any alternative.|$|E
500|$|This tactic {{developed}} {{from the first day}} that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test; they added 159 runs for the first wicket. Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and while England lost narrowly, he appeared much <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test, in which Hobbs scored 163. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting. In the third Test, he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three-wicket victory. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0 and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst match return in first-class cricket. In the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs scored 187, an innings praised by Wisden for its [...] "brilliancy". In this match he once more opened the bowling, dismissing Reggie Schwarz, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3–2 against them. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly, {{and by the end of}} the series, critics were beginning to describe him as the world's leading batsman. Wisden commented: [...] "Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise." ...|$|E
