40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a {{quarter-wave plate}} {{from a single}} layer birefringent metamaterial. For comparison, an appropriately scaled double layer <b>meanderline</b> structure was fabricated. At the design frequency of 639 GHz, the metamaterial structure achieves 99. 9 % circular polarization while the <b>meanderline</b> achieves 99. 6 %. The <b>meanderline</b> displays a larger bandwidth of operation, attaining over 99 % circular polarization from 615 - 743 GHz, while the metamaterial achieves 99 % from 626 - 660 GHz. However, both are broad enough for use with CW sources making metamaterials a more attractive choice due to the ease of fabrication. Both samples are free standing with a total thickness of 70 um for the <b>meanderline</b> structure and a mere 20 um for the metamaterial highlighting the large degree of birefringence exhibited with metamaterial structures.

40|$|Antennas {{smaller than}} a quarter {{wavelength}} are fundamentally constrained {{in a variety of}} ways. One of the more problematic limitations is that the antenna's bandwidth declines sharply as the size of the antenna decreases. Myriad studies have sought antennas that perform close to the fundamental limits, and they use a patchwork of good and bad design approaches. Our primary goal is to describe a new, complete framework to model the fundamental behavior of small antennas. We base our analysis in characteristic mode theory which allows us to decompose the antenna behavior into the behavior of a few well-defined modes. Using this decomposition we can better understand, design, and analyze small antennas. First, we explain a unified approach to model the antenna input impedance, rather than the haphazard array of approaches that are currently used. Using our model for the input impedance, we are then able to establish the conditions under which a small antenna can be effectively impedance matched, and analyze some simple methods for matching an antenna without using an external matching network. Through this study, we find that near-optimum modes actually exist in nearly every geometry but are often masked by higher order modes. From this result, a new design paradigm is proposed in which designs seek to couple into these existing modes and match using the simple methods described herein, rather than creating ever more complex and impractical structures. We also design and fabricate two novel, spherical, electrically small antennas, the TM 10 antenna and the spherical <b>meanderline</b> antenna. Both of these antennas exhibit quality factor close to the lower limit, and hence, a near-optimum bandwidth. The spherical <b>meanderline</b> antenna is particularly well-suited for automated fabrication and can achieve bandwidth comparable to the best known values. In collaboration with materials scientists, we demonstrate the spherical <b>meanderline</b> antenna, {{which is one of the}} first microwave structures printed on a curved surface using a direct-ink write process. Finally, to circumvent some of the bandwidth limitations imposed on small antennas, we propose an approach to design multimode antennas. Estimates are derived for the bandwidth increases that can be achieved with this approach to antenna broadbanding, and a simple figure of merit is suggested. A case study in broadbanding the TM 10 antenna provides some idea of what types of modal combinations are practical. Finally, a multimode spherical <b>meanderline</b> antenna matched with the simple techniques described herein is designed and fabricated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Recently, spiral {{inductors}} have widely {{been used}} in the design of matching circuits of a wireless transceiver. However, such elements usually have low quality factor (Q) and may encounter the self-resonance in microwave-frequency band which permits its use in higher frequencies, and on the other hand, they occupy the large on-chip space.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{a new class}} of radio frequency (RF) devices that combine low-insertion-loss superconductor circuits with variable magnetization ferrites. The devices are designed to prevent penetration of the superconductor by DC magnetic fields associated with the ferrite, thus preserving the low RF loss of the superconductor while allowing interaction of the RF magnetic fields with the magnetized ferrite. A prototype ferrite-superconductor phase shifter that employs high-T c YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) superconductor meanderlines has produced over 700 ° of differential phase shift at 9 GHz with a figure of merit exceeding 1000 °/dB over a 2 -GHz-wide frequency band.

40|$|EMATs are {{electromagnetic}} acoustic transducers {{that generate}} ultrasound within {{the surface of}} a conducting or magnetic sample. They offer a cheap alternative for the generation of non-contact ultrasound and are also suitable for generating a wide variety of wave modes [1], depending on the coil geometry and magnet arrangement of the EMAT. A major drawback, however, is their much lower transduction efficiency when compared to other non-contact methods such as pulsed laser generation. It has been shown that the generation of shear horizontal (SH) and surface waves in iron using <b>meanderline</b> coils, in low static fields, is due to magnetostriction [2] when the field is applied in the plane of the sample surface. The case of a spiral coil has been studied on single crystal nickel [3] and on non magnetic metals [4], however, a thorough examination on engineering steels is still required. In non magnetic metals the spiral coil EMAT is designed to generate radially polarised shear waves via the Lorentz interaction between induced eddy currents and the applied magnetic field. In ferromagnets {{it is also possible that}} magnetostriction due to the coils dynamic magnetic field plays an important role in the generation process. The aim of this work was to study the ultrasound generated by such an EMAT coil and its dependence upon applied normal field. A modified Michelson interferometer was used as a detector so that the generation process could be studied in isolation from the detection mechanism, since the interferometer would simply monitor the surface displacement. The samples studied were: aluminum, nickel, Invar (64 % Fe, 36 % Ni), mild steel and a sample of duplex stainless steel, a two phase ferritic/austenitic (magnetic/non-magnetic) alloy...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques have}} the potential to allow for earlier detection of material degradation. Recent advances in the area show promising results, but the methods used are often impractical outside laboratory conditions. Non-contact methods {{have the potential}} to address some of the current measurement limitations. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) are one potential candidate for noncontact, nonlinear measurements in metals. The EMAT ultrasonic wave generation process is complex and requires an in-depth understanding of the electro-mechanical coupling phenomena. The potential of EMAT transducers as generators and detectors has been evaluated for multiple nonlinear measurement techniques. The ultrasonic wave, generated by the interaction of the dynamically generated magnetic field and the eddy currents within the sample surface, called the self-field Lorentz force, {{have a significant impact on}} generated nonlinearity and must always be considered. For longitudinal wave measurements, the ultrasonic wave generated by the self-field Lorentz force has a similar amplitude and behaviour to the second harmonic wave generated by the material nonlinearity, thus making the measurements impractical. For shear waves, the third harmonic nonlinear ultrasonic generation shows inconclusive results with regards to microstructural change. Additionally, shear wave, nonclassical nonlinear ultrasonics show no significant change during the fatigue lifetime for aluminium alloy. Ultrasonic measurements of the temperature dependence of the sound velocity and of the coefficient of temperature expansion show a promising new field of study where EMAT application is well suited. <b>Meanderline</b> EMATs have a great potential as receivers, but not as ultrasonic transmitters for nonlinear Rayleigh waves. The ultrasonic Rayleigh waves generated by the self-field Lorentz force, have similar amplitude and behaviour to the nonlinear ultrasonic Rayleigh waves. Optimised PPM (periodic permanent magnet) EMATs are used for entirely non-contact, nonlinear measurement of third harmonic shear horizontal waves and show great potential. A new method to study and minimise experimental system nonlinearity is proposed. Measuring the ultrasonic waves generated from an artificially added harmonic distortion to the generation signal can provide a method to separate the effects of the system and the material nonlinearities. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} in modern communication systems {{is to provide a}} single antenna for different applications. Existing antenna systems are limited to some applications. So it is important to design a single reconfigurable antenna for multiple applications. Five different reconfigurable printed antennas for different applications are designed during the study of this thesis. In the first design an antenna for frequency reconfigurable applications is designed. The electrical length of the conductor is changed using PIN diodes and the resonance of antenna is shifted from 4. 27 GHz to 3. 56 GHz. Good agreement between simulated and measured results is observed. In the second and third designs, Ultra wideband (UWB) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antennas with on-demand Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) rejection are designed. The second design consists of two elements UWB-MIMO antenna and stubs are connected to the ground plane using PIN diodes. These stubs act as a stop-band filter and reject the band at 5. 5 GHz center frequency. This design has a compact size of 23 x 39. 8 mm 2. The third design has almost same features as of second design but it has four elements. These elements are placed orthogonally to each other. The total size of this proposed design is 50 x 39. 8 mm 2. The ground plane is common and a band-stop design is placed between the ground planes. This band-stop design is connected with the ground plane using PIN diodes. When diodes are biased, the current is travelled to the nearly placed band-stop design and a notch is obtained around 5. 5 GHz. In fourth design a reconfigurable array with a sensing circuit is designed. The array consists of four individual reconfigurable patches which are attached to the different conformal surfaces. These patches are reconfigured from 3. 15 GHz to 2. 43 GHz using PIN diodes. The correct phase at each element is provided using phase shifters. The sensing circuit is designed {{in such a way that}} only input voltage is changed to provide the correct phase on the switching frequency. The patterns of the array are recovered on both switching frequencies when array is attached to wedge or cylindrical surface. In the last design a series-fed array is designed. Composite Right/Left Handed Transmission Line (CRLH-TLs) are used instead of traditional <b>meanderline</b> microstrip lines to connect the array elements. These CRLH-TLs provided the zero phase at each connecting element, which resulted in broad side radiation patterns. To reconfigure the antenna to another frequency a small patch and second CRLH-TL is connected between array element...|$|E
40|$|In complex {{networks}} of ferromagnetic macrospins, like artificial spin ices or artificial quasi-crystals, much ‎interest {{has focused on}} the dynamics of Dirac strings, i. e. the apparently irregular path followed by ‎macrospin reversals, producing a magnetic charge drift across the network. The understanding and ‎control of these strings is currently the subject of intense study, and has numerous potential applications: ‎the different paths followed by the magnetic charge can, depending on the applied magnetic field and its ‎direction, be used, e. g., as spin wave guides or for magnetic bead delivery [1]. Depending on the ‎symmetry of the ferromagnetic network, and the possible presence of geometric and magnetic defects, ‎the string can be continuous or discontinuous (the extreme situation is found in aperiodic artificial quasi-‎crystals), but in any case follows a definite, reproducible sequence, which can change with the applied ‎field and direction. In ref. [2], it was shown how the origin of the string almost always starts from the ‎network edges and can be interpreted within a soft mode framework; in addition the resulting sequence ‎of macrospin reversals is correlated with the behavior of the low frequency spin-wave dynamics. ‎ In this work, we experimentally explore many features of this mechanism, in a special system, which is a ‎key geometrical element of many networks: a three-macrospin node, interacting with each other either ‎by dipole-only interaction or dipole-exchange interaction. The macrospins consist of 15 nm thick ‎elongated ellipses (aspect ratio 2. 5), made of Permalloy. The sample was fabricated using lift-off e-beam ‎lithography. DC magnetization curves were obtained using SQUID magnetometry. These curves show ‎different discontinuities corresponding to different macrospin reversals (Fig. 1). Broad band FMR ‎measurements were obtained using a <b>meanderline</b> or strip line antenna [3] ‎and clearly show mode ‎softening preceeding the magnetization discontinuities. The experimental results are interpreted within ‎the dynamical matrix method [4], and show some correlation between the measured FMR signal and the ‎calculated soft mode profile (Fig. 2). Symmetry arguments are used to examine the connection between ‎the soft mode profile and the order of reversal of the macrospins {{as a function of the}} applied field. We have also investigated the role of asymmetry on the order of reversal. Here we considered a three-‎macrospin node with an asymmetric geometry in which one arm has a reduced aspect ratio (e. g., 1. 25). ‎We studied the effects of this special asymmetry with the goal of finding general criteria, valid for other ‎asymmetries (or irregularities due to e. g. defects). Asymmetry has direct consequences on the order of ‎macrospin reversals and we will discuss its effect on the DC magnetization curves, particularly ‎discontinuities, together with the characteristics of the specific macrospin that is reversing (involving its ‎angle relative to the applied field direction, total macrospin magnetic moment, etc.). We will also discuss ‎the corresponding effects seen in the FMR curves and correlate them with the (changed) soft mode ‎profile. We can extend the above results to the analysis of actual complex networks, made up of many nodes ‎similar to those studied. As an example, consider what happens when a sequence of reversals (and the ‎associated magnetic current) lead to a Dirac string that reaches a given network node. If one macrospin of ‎that node is “preferred” over another the resulting “decision” will be a consequence of the asymmetry (in ‎our case, of geometric origin), and will be accompanied by specific soft mode dynamics of that node. Such ‎phenomena should be detectable both statically (in the DC magnetization) and dynamically (by FMR). This research paves the way to tailoring complex ferromagnetic networks in which different lines are ‎tailored by the patterning of specific macrospin aspect ratios, so that they undergo magnetization reversal ‎at a specific, predetermined, field only: the magnetic field value (together with its angle) would then act ‎as a switch, allowing the magnetic charge signal to go along one chosen path or another, at will. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, Reverberation Chambers (RC) have emerged as a {{promising}} facility for the measurement of antenna characteristics for the wireless communications industry. The RC has begun to diverge from its initial purpose of performing Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) measurements, as conceived by H. A. Mendes back in 1968. Unlike the Anechoic Chamber (AC) however, the RC facility and measurement protocols are relatively in their infancy whose standardisation {{is yet to be}} finalised. The purpose of this thesis is to present a further study into reverberation chambers and their associated measurement procedures, aimed at smoothing the transition into a fully standardised and accepted facility within the measurement industry. This thesis is comprised of three main investigation areas. The first area under investigation concerns single port textile antennas designed for use in the on-body communications role. The purpose of this investigation is twofold: (1) to chart the efficiency and impedance matching performance of the antennas in both free space and on-body roles to completely characterise their performance, and (2) to devise and configure operational procedures for the measurement of antenna characteristics on human subjects using the RC. Two separate varieties of textile antenna are subject to investigation; the first consists of two antennas with an equally small ground plane designed for use in the Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) 2. 45 GHz band. The second variety also consists of two separate antennas that have a larger ground plane size and are designed to offer a dual band characteristic; to operate at 2. 45 GHz and 5. 2 GHz respectively. The results for the smaller ground plane sized antennas show that in free space conditions, the textile antenna constructed from the higher conductivity textile material exhibits a greater level of efficiency which is expected. However, when placed on-body, the antenna with the lower conductivity textile material remarkably outperforms the antenna with the higher conductivity material which is contrary to expectations; this represents new and important knowledge. The results for the larger ground plane sized textile antennas conform completely to expectations. That is, the higher conductivity material outperformed the lower conductivity material in both free space and on-body roles. Comparing both cases, further new knowledge can be concluded in the fact that in addition to the conductivity of the textile material, the ground plane dimensions is also of crucial importance. The second area under investigation concerns multiport (array) antennas. This area is sub-divided into two sections to chart a distinction between multiport antennas designed for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) applications and more conventional array antennas that are not. The first section concerns the complete practical verification of two new dual feed Planar Inverted F Antennas (PIFAs). Results show that both antennas yield a high level of diversity gain and channel capacity (close to the theoretical maximums) and very low correlation between the two feeds despite the antennas small size. Furthermore, the antennas are also proved to be highly efficient at the desired frequency of operation. Comparing all performance results, it is possible to conclude that due to the small size and excellent performance of the new designs, they could be useful in more practical and commercial applications than larger sized elements that currently exist. The second section focuses upon more conventional larger sized array antennas used for radio astronomy applications. In this thesis, a series of power dividers is used to emulate a realistic ‘all - excited’ scenario, but the power divider approach has a consequence in that it will give rise to an external power loss that is not attributed to the antenna array. A new equation is developed in this work that allows for the accurate efficiency determination of the array and the de-embedding of the power divider in one. It is shown that the new equation can make this whole process simpler and straightforward to accomplish whilst maintaining accuracy. The final area under investigation concerns the design of reverberation chambers. The most common of the mode stirring techniques used in reverberation chambers is via the rotation or movement of electrically large metallic paddles inside the chamber known as ‘Mechanical Stirring’. In this thesis, a technique based upon a <b>meanderline</b> principle is used to cut slots into the mechanical stirring paddles to increase the current path length (induced when a wave hits the metallic surface) and thereby increase the electrical size of the paddle. New paddle designs for reverberation chambers are designed and verified. It is shown that the overall paddle dimensions {{do not need to be}} increased in size, meaning that the working volume of the chamber can remain as large as possible. The results show that the new designs exhibit enhanced performance over and above conventional paddle designs at lower modal numbers, meaning that any chamber will be able to better perform at frequencies where fewer modes exist. Results also show that at higher frequencies, the slot cuts do not adversely affect the chambers higher frequency performance. This work therefore has the potential to forge a new way of thinking when it comes to the design of mechanical stirrers in RC’s...|$|E
