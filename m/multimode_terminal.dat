30|$|Future {{wireless}} communication {{systems can be}} visualized as the integration of different radio access network (RAN) technologies, to provide always best connected. Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN) will give the service provider, a chance to provide sufficient capacity, needed to support the temporally and spatially fluctuating traffic demands generated by mobile users. A practical benefit is that users can be served at lower cost and with the better quality of service (QoS). To support freedom of movement between HWNs and seamless roaming, several VHO management architectures and decision-making algorithms have already been proposed [1]. These will allow full exploitation of flexible HWN infrastructure, resources, and services. Although individual radio resource management (RRM) schemes can be tuned to optimally perform within their respective RANs, they may not efficiently perform in an HWN if the different RRM schemes are not properly managed. Hence, a major issue is how to jointly utilize {{the resources of the}} different RANs in an efficient manner while simultaneously achieving the desired QoS and minimizing the service cost from both user and service provider perspectives. In an integrated heterogeneous wireless network (IHWN), a mobile terminal (MT) is equipped with heterogeneous network interface, which is called the <b>multimode</b> <b>terminal.</b> When a multimode MT generates or originates a new call in an IHWN, it can select connections among different types of the IHWN based on network selection strategies. An active multimode MT can also change its connections among different types of IHWN. Such a process is called the vertical handoff (VHO). Traditional handoff algorithms are based on link quality or estimate of ARP. However, this measure is not sufficient for VHO, and other factors like mobile user velocity, network condition, and user preferences should be considered. Also because of complex structure of next-generation networks, more precise and sophisticated method for link measurements is required. In mul-tipath channel, received signal strength (RSS) is consisted of three different phenomena (path loss, shadow fading, and fast fading). Because of MT mobility, multipath effect, and shadowing, the RSS has fluctuations, which make raw signal strength an unstable criterion for triggering vertical and horizontal handoffs (HHOs). Shadowing, large-scale variation in path loss, is caused by obstacles in the propagation path between the MT and the base station (BS). The small-scale variation is due to the Doppler shift along the different signal paths and the time dispersion caused by the multipath propagation delays. As one primary indicator of channel quality, the power of the slowly varying shadow component is important for handoff decisions and power control. Most existing handoff algorithms assume that multipath fluctuations can be adequately filtered and base their handoff decisions on local mean power estimates [2, 3]. Although these variations bring back uncertainty in the act of VHO decision making, they can be utilized to extract precious information about propagation environment and mobility behavior of mobile user [4]. In order to mitigate these variations in RSS, efficient smoothing techniques must be considered. If the averaging interval is too short, fluctuations may not be effectively removed, or if the interval is too long, it may cause delay in handoff procedure, or in non-line of site (NLOS) scenarios, it can average out useful information of corner's positions. To fully exploit the capacity of the wireless channel, and to overcome ping-pong effect, an efficient power estimation method is required [5, 6]. The ping-pong effect occurs if factors for VHO decision are changing rapidly and an MT performs the handoff as soon as it detects a more suitable BS. Because of heterogeneity, PHY and MAC layer of different IHWN are different, so a unified approach must be taken into consideration for collection of specific measures from different networks. As a result, more sophisticated VHO algorithm is required to extend the throughput of multilayer network and to increase efficiency of resource management for next generation of HWNs. In this paper, utilizing an accurate joint velocity and ARP estimation algorithms, a novel VHO algorithm is proposed which can effectively be used for load balancing and internetwork ping-pong effect reduction in HWNs. Also based on Markov model, an analytical model for performance evaluation of the VHO algorithm is proposed. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work on VHO algorithms. In Section 3, propagation model for an IHWN is introduced. In Section 4, proposed load balancing algorithm is discussed. VHO algorithm analysis framework is described in Section 5. The performance of the proposed VHO algorithm is analyzed through a theoretical model and simulations based on probability of blocking and probability of false network layer assignment in Section 6. Finally, paper is concluded in Section 7.|$|E

40|$|A current focus among {{communication}} engineers is {{to design}} flexible radio systems {{in order to}} handle services among different telecommunication standards. Efficient support of dynamic interactive communication systems requires flexible and cost-efficient radio systems. Thus, low-cost <b>multimode</b> <b>terminals</b> will be crucial building blocks for future generations of multimode communication systems. Here, different bandwidths, from different telecommunication standards, must be supported and, thus, {{there is a need}} for a system which can handle a number of different bandwidths. This can be done using multimode transmultiplexers (TMUXs) which make it possible for different users to share a common channel in a time-varying manner. These TMUXs allow bandwidth-on-demand so that the resulting communication system has a dynamic allocation of bandwidth to users. Each user occupies a specific portion of the channel where the location and width of this portion may vary with time. Another focus among communication engineers is to provide various wideband services accessible to everybody everywhere. Here, satellites with high-gain spot beam antennas, on-board signal processing, and switching will be a major complementary part of future digital communication systems. Satellites provide a global coverage and if a satellite is in orbit, customers only need to install a satellite terminal and subscribe to the service. Efficient utilization of the available limited frequency spectrum, by these satellites, calls for on-board signal processing to perform flexible frequency-band reallocation (FFBR). Considering these two focuses in one integrated system where the TMUXs operate on-ground and FFBR networks operate on-board, one can conclude that successful design of dynamic communication systems requires high levels of flexibility in digital signal processing structures. In other words, {{there is a need for}} flexible digital signal processing structures that can support different telecommunication scenarios and standards. This flexibility (or reconfigurability) must not impose restrictions on the hardware and, ideally, it must come at the expense of simple software modifications. In other words, the system is based on a hardware platform and its parameters can easily be modified without the need for hardware changes. This thesis aims to outline flexible TMUX and FFBR structures which can allow dynamic communication scenarios with simple software reconfigurations on the same hardware platform. In both structures, the system parameters are determined in advance. For these parameters, the required filter design problems are solved only once. Dynamic communications, with users having different time-varying bandwidths, are then supported by adjusting some multipliers of the proposed multimode TMUXs and a simple software programming in the channel switch of the FFBR network. These do not require any hardware changes and can be performed online. However, the filter design problem is solved only once and offline...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{trends in}} mobile {{networking}} show the large scale emergence of <b>multimode</b> mobile <b>terminals,</b> with {{the capability to}} simultaneously or sequentially attach to conceptually different access networks. To cope with this, they require an abstracted framework for mobility management and control. A solution to this issue, called Media Independent Handover Services, is standardized by the 802. 21 group of the IEEE. This work has been studied and applied {{to the case of}} a B 3 G operator networks in an EU-funded research project in order to improve seamless handover between heterogeneous technologies. This paper focuses on the integration of the Beyond- 3 G cellular access technology in this framework, and how it can cooperate with the 802. 21 to execute handovers to and from cellular networks. This study has been implemented in an experimental software radio platform which provides a direct inter-connection between the access node and the IPv 6 Core Network, very close to the LTE specifications of the 3 GPP. We describe here the mapping between a selection of Media Independent Handover primitives and the cellular air interface procedures available in the platform for Mobility, Quality of Service management and Multicast support (MBMS). Finally, we provide some measurements and results obtained after the integration and demonstration of the heterogeneous network framework...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{telecommunication}} environment, <b>multimode</b> multiband <b>terminals</b> are common place in transceivers architectures. These terminals integrate several radio frequency front-ends each {{for a different}} radio frequency band. Proper operation requires a separate radio frequency filter or duplexer for each band. In addition to this, filters are relatively large in size compared to other front-end components. Consequently, filters and duplexers occupy an increasing portion of modem radio frequency transceivers' real-estate. This has led the research community to dedicate more effort to filter miniaturisation techniques. This work subscribes to this context {{in an effort to}} develop miniaturised filters and duplexers with low losses and high isolation. This thesis presents a miniaturised topology based on a topological miniaturisation technique using computer aided design and analysis. The filters designed in this work are suitable for manufacturing on any planar fabrication technology such as Monolithic Hybrid Microwave Integrated Circuit (MHMIC) and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC). These specific processes were selected and used for fabrication because of their high miniaturisation and integration features. The realised filters show a significant reduction in size compared to {{the current state of the}} art. The proposed miniaturization technique, combined with multilayer fabrication technologies and other fabrication advancements, can potentially lead to filters and duplexers of reasonable sizes for monolithic integration...|$|R
