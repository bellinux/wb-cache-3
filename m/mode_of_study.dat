Marking those two bodies distinctly as separate, and thinking over them, you may come to some rather notable conclusions respecting the mental dispositions which are involved in each <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> You will find that large masses of the art of the world fall definitely under {{one or the other of}} these heads. Observe, pleasure first and truth afterwards, (or not at all,) as with the Arabians and Indians; or, truth first and pleasure afterwards, as with Angelico and all other great European painters. You will find that the art whose end is pleasure only is pre-eminently the gift of cruel and savage nations, cruel in temper, savage in habits and conception; but that the art which is especially dedicated to natural fact always indicates a peculiar gentleness and tenderness of mind, and that all great and successful work of that kind will assuredly be the production of thoughtful, sensitive, earnest, kind men, large in their views of life, and full of various intellectual power. And farther, when you examine the men in whom the gifts of art are variously mingled, or universally mingled, you will discern that the ornamental, or pleasurable power, though it may be possessed by good men, is not in itself an indication of their goodness, but is rather, unless balanced by other faculties, indicative of violence of temper, inclining to cruelty and to irreligion. On the other hand, so sure as you find any man endowed with a keen and separate faculty of representing natural fact, so surely you will find that man gentle and upright, full of nobleness and breadth of thought. I will give you two instances, the first peculiarly English, and another peculiarly interesting because it occurs among a nation not generally very kind or gentle.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a lot}} of anecdotal {{evidence}} that reading musical notation can cause musicians to sense an auditory image of the notes they are reading which is a phenomenon called notational audiation. Present studies show that only some musicians who can read musical notation can hear an inner voice emulating the melody while reading the notation which has served as an interesting <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> to understand the way information is encoded in the brain. Musicians have their sense of notational audiation significantly impaired during phonatory distractions due to the conflicting signals induced onto a single sensory modality. Some musicians who are proficient at reading sheet music may experience an auditory image while reading over the excerpt for Symphony No. 40 from Mozart below.|$|E

This multivariate technique method {{is used to}} profile the subjects ’ attitude into either positive or negative attitude towards statistics. The study had characterized each profile of learners by relating to his/her perceived attitudes toward statistics, types of learners, <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> programme structure, age, gender and learners ’ evaluation towards the statistics course. Learners ’ attitudes toward statistics were measured using the Attitudes Toward Statistics (ATS) instrument which comprised four sub-scales or dimensions, namely, Affect, Cognitive Competence, Value and Difficulty. These variables are examined as predictors that discriminate learners with positive and negative attitudes toward statistics. The results indicate that learners with positive attitudes can be reliably distinguished from learners with negative attitudes toward statistics across the four ATS sub-scales, types of learners, <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> and learner’s evaluation towards the course.

40|$|ABSTRACT The UK Government’s recent {{emphasis}} on the graduate workforce raises the profile of work placements within higher education. Anecdotally, the authors find that students on their optional bioscience sandwich degrees benefit academically from placement experience {{but there is little}} supportive evidence of this in the literature. To investigate rigorously the link between sandwich placement and academic performance, two cohorts of bioscience students (n = 164) were described in terms of gender (male = 0, female = 1), pre-university qualifications (HESA score), academic performance (%) for each year of degree study (first, second, and final), and <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> (non-placement = 0, placement = 1). Multiple regression analysis yielded the following predictive equation where all terms were significant: Final % = 28. 80 + 2. 97 (gender) + 0. 14 (HESA score) + 0. 44 (Second%) + 3. 82 (mode). On average, placement students gain an advantage of nearly 4 % in their final year performance. Given that the final year contributes 75 % towards degree classification, over a quarter of placement students may benefit from the independent effect of <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> by crossing a threshold into a higher degree class...|$|E
