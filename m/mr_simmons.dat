6000|$|There was a pause, {{at the end}} {{of which}} I heard <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> set down his empty tankard with emphasis. [...] "You poor morbid mooning man," [...] he resumed, [...] "I don't want to say {{anything}} to make you feel sore. I regularly pity you. But you must allow that you've acted more like a confirmed crank than a member of our best society--in which every one's so sensible." ...|$|E

5000|$|In June 1980, {{he married}} his third and last wife, Annette Caldwell Fleck (born 1936), an {{interior}} designer with two children from a previous marriage. She {{is a native of}} Tyler, Texas and a graduate of Southern Methodist University. After graduating, she taught second and third grade in Dallas and at Clark Field, a U.S. air base in the Philippines. In October 2004, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Simmons</b> was featured on the Oprah! television show, giving a tour of Simmons' boyhood town, Golden, Texas, during its sweet potato festival. In another episode, [...] "Annette's Tea Party," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Simmons</b> entertainment style was a feature.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> {{thought it}} shrewdly over. [...] "Well, you ARE sick!" [...] he exclaimed presently. [...] "All I {{can say is}} that if you're working out a plan for cold poison, or for any other act of desperation, you had better give it right up. You can't get a dose of the commonest kind of cold poison for nothing, you know. Look here, Searle"--and the worthy man made what struck me as a very decent appeal. [...] "If you'll consent to return home with me by the steamer of the twenty-third I'll pay your passage down. More than that, I'll pay for your beer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very glad to think I didn't, sir. I've been to no small amount of {{personal}} inconvenience for you. I've pushed my way {{right up to the}} headspring. I've got the best opinion that's to be had. The best opinion that's to be had just gives you one leer over its spectacles. I guess that look will fix you if you ever get it straight. I've been able to tap, indirectly," [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> went on, [...] "the solicitor of your usurping cousin, and he evidently knows something to be in the wind. It seems your elder brother twenty years ago put out a feeler. So you're not to have the glory of even making them sit up." ...|$|E
6000|$|His cold {{counsellor}} {{was in the}} act {{of choosing}} a soft chop from the dish--an act accompanied by a great deal of prying and poking with that gentleman's own fork. My disillusioned compatriot had pushed away his plate; he sat with his elbows on the table, gloomily nursing his head with his hands. His companion watched him and then seemed to wonder--to do <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> justice--how he could least ungracefully give him up. [...] "I say, Searle,"--and for my benefit, I think, taking me for a native ingenuous enough to be dazzled by his wit, he lifted his voice a little and gave it an ironical ring--"in this country it's the inestimable privilege of a loyal citizen, under whatsoever stress of pleasure or of pain, to make a point of eating his dinner." ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{bursts in}} the {{seamstress}} with {{a whirlwind of}} denial, and the altercation wages fast and furious, and poor, little, delicate <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Simmons</b> stands like a kitten in a thunderstorm {{in the midst of}} a regular Irish row.|$|R

6000|$|... "I really can't say, my dear," [...] {{replied the}} old lawyer, thoughtfully; [...] "but I imagine she'll try to, and if Dan doesn't give in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Simmons</b> will {{probably}} make his life miserable for a time. You flattered them both outrageously; {{but that will}} do no harm." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, gentlemen, in conclusion, {{animated}} by your cordial acquiescence, I will take upon myself to assure our brothers {{from a distance}} that the utmost enthusiasm with which they can be received on their return home will find a ready echo {{in every corner of}} England--and further, that none of their immediate countrymen--I use the qualifying term immediate, for we are, as our president said, fellow countrymen, thank God--that none of their compatriots who saw, or who will read of, what they did in this great race, can be more thoroughly imbued with a sense of their indomitable courage and their high deserts than are their rivals and their hosts to- night. Gentlemen, I beg to propose to you to drink the crews of Harvard and Oxford University, and I beg to couple with that toast the names of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> and Mr. Willan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks to your liking so {{to please}} folks!" [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons</b> {{appeared}} {{for a moment}} at odds with something; it proved to be with his liquor. [...] "I rather think your beer's too good to be true," [...] he said to the waiter. [...] "I guess I'll take water. Come, old man," [...] he resumed, [...] "don't challenge me to the arts of debate, or you'll have me right down on you, and then you WILL feel me. My native sweetness, as I say, was part of it. The idea that if I put the thing through {{it would be a very}} pretty feather in my cap and a very pretty penny in my purse was part of it. And the satisfaction of seeing a horrid low American walk right into an old English estate was a good deal of it. Upon my word, Searle, when I think of it I wish with all my heart that, extravagant vain man as you are, I COULD, for the charm of it, put you through! I should hardly care what you did with the blamed place when you got it. I could leave you alone to turn it into Yankee notions--into ducks and drakes as they call 'em here. I should like to see you tearing round over it and kicking up its sacred dust in their very faces!" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{agent was}} {{standing}} by Tryst's bed, keeping up a stream of comment to two of his men, who were taking that aged bed to pieces. It was his habit to feel less when he talked more; {{but no one could}} have fallen into a more perfect taciturnity than he when he saw Kirsteen coming up those narrow stairs. In so small a space as this room, where his head nearly touched the ceiling, was it fair to be confronted by that lady--he put it to his wife that same evening--"Was it fair?" [...] He had seen a mother wild duck look like that when you took away its young--snaky fierce about the neck, and its dark eye! He had seen a mare, going to bite, look not half so vicious! [...] "There she stood, and--let me have it?--not a bit! Too much the lady for that, you know!--Just looked at me, and said very quiet: 'Ah! <b>Mr.</b> <b>Simmons,</b> and are you really doing this?' and put her hand on that little girl of his. 'Orders are orders, ma'am!' What could I say? 'Ah!' she said, 'yes, orders are orders, but they needn't be obeyed.' 'As to that, ma'am,' I said--mind you, she's a lady; you can't help feeling that 'I'm a working man, the same as Tryst here; got to earn my living.' 'So have slave-drivers, Mr. Simmons.' 'Every profession,' I said, 'has got its dirty jobs, ma'am. And that's a fact.' 'And will have,' she said, 'so long as professional men consent to do the dirty work of their employers.' 'And where should I be, I should like to know,' I said, 'if I went on that lay? I've got to take the rough with the smooth.' 'Well,' she said, 'Mr. Freeland and I will take Tryst and the little ones in at present.' Good-hearted people, do a lot for the laborers, in their way. All the same, she's a bit of a vixen. Picture of a woman, too, standin' there; shows blood, mind you! Once said, all over--no nagging. She took the little girl off with her. And pretty small I felt, knowing I'd got to finish that job, and the folk outside gettin' nastier all the time--not sayin' much, of course, but lookin' a lot!" [...] The agent paused in his recital and gazed fixedly at a bluebottle crawling up the windowpane. Stretching out his thumb and finger, he nipped it suddenly and threw it in the grate. [...] "Blest if that fellow himself didn't turn up just as I was finishing. I was sorry for the man, you know. There was his home turned out-o'-doors. Big man, too! 'You blanky-blank!' he says; 'if I'd been here you shouldn't ha' done this!' Thought he was goin' to hit me. 'Come, Tryst!' I said, 'it's not my doing, you know!' 'Ah!' he said, 'I know that; and it'll be blanky well the worse for THEM!' Rough tongue; no class of man at all, he is! 'Yes,' he said, 'let 'em look out; I'll be even with 'em yet!' 'None o' that!' I told him; 'you know which side the law's buttered. I'm making it easy for you, too, keeping your things in the wagon, ready to shift any time!' He gave me a look--he's got very queer eyes, swimmin', sad sort of eyes, like a man in liquor--and he said: 'I've been here twenty years,' he said. 'My wife died here.' And {{all of a sudden he}} went as dumb as a fish. Never let his eyes off us, though, while we finished up the last of it; made me feel funny, seein' him glowering like that all the time. He'll savage something over this, you mark my words!" [...] Again the agent paused, and remained as though transfixed, holding that face of his, whose yellow had run into the whites of the eyes, as still as wood. [...] "He's got some feeling for the place, I suppose," [...] he said suddenly; [...] "or maybe they've put it into him about his rights; there's plenty of 'em like that. Well, anyhow, nobody likes his private affairs turned inside out for every one to gape at. I wouldn't myself." [...] And with that deeply felt remark the agent put out his leathery-yellow thumb and finger and nipped a second bluebottle....|$|E
