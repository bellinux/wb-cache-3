These are systems of synchronous components strongly synchronized {{by a common}} action that initiates steps of each component. We propose a general model for synchronous systems.

Priorities are instrumental for enforcing run-to-completion in the execution of a step. We study a class of well-triggered synchronous systems which are by construction deadlock-free and their computation within a step is confluent. For this class, the behavior of components is modeled by modal flow graphs. These are acyclic graphs representing three different types of dependency between two events p and q: strong dependency (p must follow q), weak dependency (p may follow q), conditional dependency (if both p and q occur then p must follow q).

40|$|Abstract—Security {{concerns}} {{surrounding the}} rise of Big Data systems have stimulated myriad new Big Data security models and implementations {{over the past few}} years. A significant disadvantage shared by most of these implementations is that they customize the underlying system source code to enforce new policies, making the customizations difficult to maintain as these layers evolve over time (e. g., over version updates). This paper demonstrates how a broad class of safety policies, including fine-grained access control policies at the level of key-value data pairs rather than files, can be elegantly enforced on MapReduce clouds with minimal overhead and without any change to the system or OS implementations. The approach real-izes policy enforcement as a middleware layer that rewrites the cloud’s front-end API with reference monitors. After rewriting, the jobs run on input data authorized by fine-grained access control policies, allowing them to be safely executed without additional system-level controls. Detailed empirical studies show that this more <b>modular</b> approach <b>exhibits</b> just 1 % overhead compared to a less modular implementation that customizes MapReduce directly to enforce the same policies.

40|$|Estimating {{influential}} nodes {{in large}} scale networks including {{but not limited}} to social networks, biological networks, communication networks, emerging smart grids etc. is a topic of fundamental interest. To understand influences of nodes in a network, a classical metric is centrality within which there are multiple specific instances including degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and more. As of today, existing algorithms to identify nodes with high centrality measures operate upon the entire (or rather global) network, resulting in high computational complexity. In this paper, we design efficient algorithms for determining the betweenness centrality in large scale networks by taking advantage of the <b>modular</b> topology <b>exhibited</b> by most of these large scale networks. Very briefly, modular topologies are those wherein the entire network appears partitioned into distinct modules (or clusters or communities), wherein nodes within the module (that likely share highly similar profiles) have dense connections between them, while connections across modules are relatively sparse. Using a novel adaptation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and executing it over local modules and over sparse edges between modules, we design algorithms that can correctly compute the betweenness centrality much faster than existing algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that leverage modular topologies of large scale networks to address the centrality problem, though here we mostly limit our discussions to social networks.

40|$|Abstract—Self-reconfigurable robots are {{expected}} to exhibit various interesting abilities, such as adaptivity and fault tol-erance. These remarkable abilities originate {{from the fact that}} their mechanical systems intrinsically possess very large degrees of freedom. This, however, causes a serious problem, i. e., controllability. To overcome this, autonomous decentralized control is expected to play a crucial role, as widely observed in living organisms. However, much is still not understood about how such decentralized control can be achieved. This is mainly because the logic connecting local behaviors to global behaviors is still not understood. In this study, we particularly focus on a very primitive living organism, slime mold (physarum poly-cepharum), since it is believed to employ a fully decentralized control based on coupled biochemical oscillators. We modeled a decentralized control algorithm based on coupled nonlinear oscillators and then implement this into a two-dimensional modular robot consisting of incompressive fluid (i. e., proto-plasm) covered with an outer skin composed of a network of passive and real-time tunable springs. Preliminary simulation results showed that this <b>modular</b> robot <b>exhibits</b> significantly supple locomotion similar to amoeboid locomotion and that the exploitation of the “long-distant interaction ” stemming from “the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass ” performs some of the “computation ” that the controller would otherwise have to carry out. As a consequence, adaptive amoeboid locomotion emerges without the need for any centralized control system. The results obtained are also expected to shed new light on how control and mechanical systems with large degrees of freedom should be coupled. I...|$|R

Here we used resting-state functional MRI (n= 42 ASD, n= 37 typically developing; TD) to show that children and adolescents with ASD display reduced short and long-range connectivity within functional systems (i. e., reduced functional integration) and stronger connectivity between functional systems (i. e., reduced functional segregation), particularly in default and higher-order visual regions. Using graph theoretical methods, we show that pairwise group differences in functional connectivity are reflected in network level reductions in modularity and clustering (local efficiency), but shorter characteristic path lengths (higher global efficiency). Structural networks, generated from diffusion tensor MRI derived fiber tracts (n= 51 ASD, n= 43 TD), displayed lower levels of white matter integrity yet higher numbers of fibers. TD and ASD individuals exhibited similar levels of correlation between raw measures of structural {{and functional}} connectivity (n= 35 ASD, n= 35 TD).
