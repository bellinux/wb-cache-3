40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that the occurrence and intensity of disasters will increase globally and in South Africa where typical disasters include droughts, floods, extreme hailstorms, gales, fires and earthquakes, as well as sinkholes arising from mining activity in dolomitic areas. Disasters such as these result in human suffering and damage to the resources and infrastructure on which South Africans rely for their survival {{and the maintenance of}} their quality of life. Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 affords to everyone the right to an environment that is not harmful to his or her health and well-being. It may be argued that a person's sense of environmental security in relation to the potential risks and dangers of disaster falls within the scope of the protection provided by section 24. The responsibility to intervene {{for the protection of the}} interests inherent in the constitutional environmental right lies with the government of South Africa. Disaster management specifically is a functional area of competence of national and provincial government, but practice has shown that the actual implementation of and planning for disaster management happens in the local government sphere. Against the backdrop of these introductory discussions and, given the fact that several municipalities in South Africa are under-resourced, this article very specifically aims to critically discuss and describe from a legal perspective the potential and function of public-private partnerships (PPPs) between local government (municipalities) and the private sector (such as industries) in fulfilling the legally entrenched disaster <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> of municipalities. Through a critical evaluation of some existing PPPs, this article illustrates that the private sector has a key role to play in assisting municipalities to fulfil their legally entrenched disaster <b>management</b> <b>mandate...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we conceptualise {{the role}} of {{headquarters}} not as bound to a unique physical location but {{as a set of}} functions distributed across the multinational enterprise. Specifically, we investigate the phenomenon of delegating headquarters functions to local subsidiaries in the form of regional <b>management</b> <b>mandates</b> (RMMs), a new concept not addressed in prior research. Our work contributes to the literature by building a comprehensive typology of headquarters functions performed at various levels of the multinational enterprise and by developing propositions about the potential benefits and risks of using RMMs, drawing on various theoretical perspectives and a rich empirical case study. Our findings suggest that the use of regional <b>management</b> <b>mandates</b> offers several benefits for the MNE: (1) the ability to balance integration and responsiveness at levels below the efficient scale for dedicated regional headquarters; (2) the exploitation of local operational expertise on a regional level; (3) relieving headquarters of the burden of monitoring remote peripheral agents.

40|$|Cooperative {{mandates}} represent {{new thinking}} about intergovernmental relationships and {{a shift from}} the top-down coercive approach. This research presents evidence on how a cooperative national environmental <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> influences the quality of regional and district plans in New Zealand. Findings indicate that cooperative planning mandates such as New Zealand's Resource Management Act are difficult to translate into practice. The quality of regional and district plans was unimpressive. Empirical modelling shows that clear legislative provisions, the information dissemination strategies of central government, and subnational organisational capacity had an important impact on regional and district plan quality. Alternatively, the organisational capacity and plans of regional councils have little influence on the capacity and plans of district councils. These findings suggest that, though clear mandates are effective, more attention needs {{to be given to}} building subnational organisational capacity and to improving the information provision efforts of central government. More attention also needs to be directed to facilitating collaboration between regional and district councils. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{maintains}} that the Forest Service (FS), as an institution, is in deep trouble. It argues that the FS today is an agency without a unique mission and without a supporting constituency. For the FS to be viable in the future it needs a distinct well-defined mission and a committed constituency. The distinct mission needs to be generally supported, {{or at least not}} opposed, by most of the American people. The constituency needs to be committed to the FS {{to the extent that it}} will provide major support in the Congress for FS budgets. The paper identifies some potential candidates for a mission for the National Forest System (NFS), e. g., as a biological reserve or as a provider of forest recreation. Another potential paradigm could be that of the Quincy Library Group, which apparently is going to receive separate Congressional funding and a unique <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> for a set of national forests in California. This paper examines the feasibility of these missions and paradigms including budget and constituency support. Finally, there is the question of whether the FS has completed its useful life and if society would be better served by merging existing land management agencies into an integrated agency that can better provide for the coordinated management required. ...|$|E

40|$|Internal audit {{functions}} (IAFs) of organisations {{are regarded}} as crucial components of the combined assurance model, alongside the audit committee, management and external auditors. The combined assurance model aims at having integrated and aligned assurance in organisations with the overall aim of maximising risk and governance oversight and control efficiencies. In this regard, internal audit plays a crucial role, insofar as it consists of experts in risk, governance and control consultancy who provide assurance to senior management and the audit committee. Audit committees are dependent on internal audit for information and their effectiveness revolves around a strong and well-resourced internal audit function which is able to aid audit committees to meet their oversight responsibilities. There is thus a growing demand for managing risk {{through the process of}} risk management and internal audit is in a perfect position to assist with the improvement of such processes. If internal auditors wish to continue being an important aspect of the combined assurance model, they need to address the critical area, amongst others, of risk management as part of their work. If not, it follows that the board, audit committees and other levels of management will remain uninformed on the status of these matters which, in turn, will negatively impact the ability of these stakeholders to discharge their responsibilities. This study therefore focuses on analysing the functioning of IAFs, with specific reference to their risk <b>management</b> <b>mandate.</b> The study followed a mixed method approach to describe internal audits risk management functioning in the big eight metropolitan municipalities in South Africa.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{protected}} area management effectiveness evaluations {{has been growing}} in response to calls for increased accountability and transparency in management. Thousands of site assessments have been conducted globally to build understanding of the protected area estate. It is imperative for biological conservation to {{have an understanding of}} the relative success of protected areas given that they are recognised as the cornerstone of conservation efforts globally. This dissertation uses the New South Wales, Australia, State of the Parks, {{which is one of the}} most comprehensive network-wide assessments ever conducted. The State of the Parks management effectiveness evaluation collected data on a full suite of park attributes, resource inputs and management practices, with the aim of better understanding management across the park network. This evaluation was also stimulated by the need to be accountable to stakeholders and by a desire for continuous improvement in management. The dataset that resulted from the State of the Parks management effectiveness evaluation was large. It collected information on 774 parks in the reserve network. The main objectives of this research were to develop a suitable method of analysis that provided an appropriate means of analysing and presenting the State of the Parks data to explain and interpret the factors most strongly influencing (driving) management effectiveness in the NSW protected area network. A review of existing management effectiveness evaluations revealed that little documented information on analysis methods was available. Broader review of the literature found that this was also a common problem in program evaluation. In protected area evaluation where information was available, the most common forms of analyses were summative statistics used to describe the data, and bivariate correlations used to understand the relationships between variables of interest. In-depth multivariate analysis of relationships between multiple variables was lacking. This also translated to a lack of understanding of the factors that most strongly influence management effectiveness. To fulfill the objective of understanding the driving influences of management effectiveness a series of analyses were conducted. The initial analysis was exploratory and had the benefit of using the majority of the State of the Parks data which could potentially have remained underutilized. A base analysis using the techniques applied in previous management effectiveness evaluations was also conducted to describe the data and to explain whether NSW PWS was achieving its <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> and which management actions were important in achieving outcomes. A problem arose after the base and exploratory analysis in presentation of the data. The complexity and sheer extent of the data meant that some type of simplification was required so that it could be sufficiently understood by a range of audiences. A mathematical metric was used to simplify the data combining the results of the key management areas (i. e. General Administration, Natural Heritage, Cultural Heritage and Visitor Management) into single scores, which provided a relative measure of performance. These data were also presented spatially to enhance communication potential. It was found that NSW PWS was meeting its <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> for the majority of protected areas. The main factors influencing management effectiveness were the landscape context of parks and the relative planning and staff time allocations. The NSW PWS resource allocations were found to correlate to high levels of contextual pressures, namely high visitation, high numbers of neighboring properties, the size and age of the park. This demonstrates, with the use of park typologies, that it is possible to define characteristics of parks and the associated expectations of performance using a set of key criteria. In current conservation and natural resource management the focus has shifted to a landscape scale. The finding of this thesis that landscape context is a driving influence on the ability to manage protected areas effectively in New South Wales adds weight to the argument for conservation that stretches beyond the boundaries of protected areas. Perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that with management input and actions that directly address landscape pressures conservation can be successful in less than optimal situations...|$|E
40|$|M. Environmental Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In {{order to}} address the growing waste {{concerns}} facing South Africa, the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) published the National Waste Management Strategy in 2012. The ultimate aim of the strategy is to effect the realisation of {{the objectives of the}} National Environmental Management Waste Act (NEMWA). The NEMWA is a sector environmental law based on the waste management hierarchy and its provisions apply to waste management activities in all three government spheres amongst others. The NWMS provides for eight distinct goals with accompanying targets to be met by 2016. Some of these goals and targets speak directly to the solid waste <b>management</b> <b>mandate</b> of local government. Concerns about the capacity of municipalities to see the execution of this mandate however, raise questions about the likelihood of some NWMS goals and targets being met by 2016. The North West Province serves as a case in point where recent reports by the office of the Auditor General have highlighted significant non-compliance in local government with the provisions of the existing waste law and policy framework of South Africa. It appears form these reports that a number of performance gaps and capacity constraints exist as far as it concerns municipal solid waste management. Against this back ground the study questions the governance strategies necessary within the municipalities of the North West Province to: a) address the existing performance gaps and capacity constraints and b) progressively move towards meeting the NWMS goals and targets as far as it concerns solid waste management. The study will explore the objectives, goals and targets of the NWMS against the background of the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) and NEMWA, with a specific focus on solid waste management. The study will further review the documented performance gaps and capacity constraints as a far as it concerns solid waste management in municipalities in the North West province, specifically.

40|$|Background: The {{burden of}} illness {{associated}} with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) has determined {{this as a}} key focus for research at a basic science, individual and population level. Although considerable {{research has been conducted}} on specific aspects of the experience of CHD, such as anxiety or depression, {{there is a lack of}} research investigating the global aspects of the illness experience from the individual 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research examining the cross-cultural experiences of patients from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds (NESB). Given the multicultural nature of Australian society, and that health and illness are culturally constructed experiences (Manderson 1990), it is important to include the perspectives of people from minority cultures in health related research in order to provide culturally sensitive and appropriate health care and information during an illness. Further, the potential to prevent and modulate the course of CHD, by strategies such as smoking cessation and lipid <b>management,</b> <b>mandate</b> a health promotion agenda based on equity and access for all members of society. Aims: This article discusses cultural aspects of CHD in relation to nursing and allied health care during the recovery phase of an acute cardiac event. It reviews the research that has been conducted in this area, focusing on the Chinese-Australian population. Literature search: The CINAHL, MEDLINE, FAMILY (Australian Family and Society Abstracts Database), PsychINFO, and Multicultural Australian and immigration Studies (MAIS) databases were searched, identifying literature published from 1982.

40|$|Managing tourism {{destinations}} is {{a multifaceted}} phenomenon {{due to the}} fragmented nature of the industry, where stakeholders such as private enterprises, public agencies and community groups operate in a relatively autonomous way. These diverse stakeholder groups generally collaborate through marketing initiatives to promote the tourism destination offering. However, {{there is a growing}} consensus that the Destination Management Organisation (DMO) has assumed a broader <b>management</b> <b>mandate.</b> Tourism destinations are reliant on the availability of natural and human resources; success from a management perspective is therefore dependent on the DMO’s capability to deploy these resources effectively. However it is widely acknowledged in the literature, that managing this disjointed array of stakeholders is a complex process. Destination age adds to the complexity of the problem, as destinations may have varying management needs as they traverse through the different stages of destination lifecycle. Therefore, this study adopts a network lens, where the DMO is a managed strategic net, comprised of a number of key tourism actors, in addition to an official tourism support agency. The theoretical basis of this study is drawn from the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm, which acknowledges that the DMO must possess specific dynamic capabilities to deploy, modify and recreate destination resources. As such, this research study seeks to identify and explain the dynamic capabilities required by the DMO to manage a tourism destination effectively. Taking an interpretative philosophical position, this study adopts a multiple case study research methodology to identify and examine the dynamic capabilities present within the DMO in three tourism destinations at different stages of destination lifecycle. The findings demonstrate that the DMO possesses key management capabilities in the form of partnering, visioning and orchestration, which is a key contribution of this research. While the findings confirm that these capabilities are evident in the three case sites studied, their relative effectiveness in managing the destination is explained by the specific embeddedness of relationships within each destination. Based on the research conclusions, an integrated destination management capability model is presented which highlights the interplay between these dynamic capabilities, which drive operating routines in pursuit of sustained competitive advantage. This model provides a basis for future research...|$|E
