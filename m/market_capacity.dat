40|$|Rising feed-in from {{renewable}} energy sources decreases margins, load factors, and thereby profitability of conventional generation in several electricity markets around the world. At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e. g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain. We assess the effect of different <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> design options in three scenarios: 1) no <b>capacity</b> <b>market,</b> 2) a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new <b>capacity</b> only, and 3) a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new and existing capacity. We compare the results along the three key dimensions of electricity policy ��� affordability, reliability, and sustainability. In a Great Britain case study we find that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> increases generation adequacy since it provides incentives for new generation investments. Furthermore, our results show that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> can lower the total bill of generation because it can reduce lost load and the potential to exercise market power. Additionally, we find that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new <b>capacity</b> only is cheaper than a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new and existing capacity because it remunerates fewer generators {{in the first years}} after its introduction. {{renewable energy}} source...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{implementation}} of Regulation 139/2004 and the turn towards a more effects-based approach to EU competition law, EU merger control was governed by EEC Regulation 4064/89. Under EEC Regulation 4064/89 (the 'old' regulation), a merger or concentration was prohibited if it would"create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would significantly impeded".The old substantive test is said to have encouraged two alternative interpretations of how to apply the test. The alternative interpretations suggest that, the presence of dominance alone is a sufficient condition to satisfy the dominance test and that as part of a two-tier test dominance is a necessary condition to satisfy before considering the dynamics of competition between the parties merging and the competitive characteristics of the market following the notification of a merger. The effective of the old [...] "dominance test" [...] increasingly began to be called into question with concerns regarding the issues of overenforcement and the false positives. The case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 served as the case that ultimately urged the Commission to recommend a change in EU merger regulation. The Commission prohibited the merger of Airtours and First Choice on the basis that it would create a collective dominant position in the market since there would be an incentive for the remaining firms in an oligopolistic market to restrict <b>market</b> <b>capacity,</b> leading to higher prices and increased profits as a result of subsequent market conditions following the merger. The oligopolists need not always [...] "behave as if there were one or more explicit agreements between them." [...] The Commission believed it was [...] "sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them." [...] In the case of Airtours v Commission, the Court of First Instance annulled the Commission's decision to prohibit the Airtours-First Choice merger {{on the grounds that the}} Commission's interpretation of collective dominance was not informed by the widely recognised indicator of anti-competitive behaviour in an oligopolistic market - tacit collusion. The Airtours legal action created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as a perceived gap had arisen with the law at the time - the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern that energy-only markets are inadequate {{when it comes}} to ensuring generation adequacy in the power sector over the long term. This is reflected in the fact that several Independent System Operators have commissioned studies about security of supply over the last few years; OFGEM and CEER (Council of European Energy Regulators) are some of them. There is some empirical evidence and substantial theory as to why incentives for investments are insufficient in such <b>markets.</b> <b>Capacity</b> mechanisms are policy tools that aim at providing incentive to this investment into reliability – both over the long-term and short-term. Compounding this inadequacy of energy-only markets is the expected change in the composition of the generating portfolio over the coming decades. It is expected that the European electricity industry is almost entirely carbon free by 2050. In addition, implementation of a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> in a country in hugely interconnected Europe might show cross border effects that need further insight and understanding. The purpose of this work is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>capacity</b> <b>markets,</b> a type of capacity mechanism, in its ability to ensure long term generation adequacy, and more generally, improve the performance of the electricity sector and increase consumer and producer welfare. The effectiveness of <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> are assessed primarily on the following indicators: performance of the electricity market (adequacy of supply, stable energy prices), consumer welfare and producer welfare. This work is part of a larger project at the Energy and Industry section of TPM, EMLab Generation, which is focused on studying the electricity market in transition towards a low-carbon regime. The methodology applied to carry out this research is agent based modelling. A model of the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> has been built and analysed. In order to conceptualize a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> model, a thorough literature review and empirical study was carried out on the existing variations of <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> that are implemented across the world. While there are slight variations between them, the overarching principle beind them remains the same - to administratively place an obligation on the load to buy supply to meet a certain reserve margin of generation. The New York ISO Installed <b>Capacity</b> (NYISO ICAP) <b>market</b> was used as the primary basis to conceptualize the <b>capacity</b> <b>market.</b> The NYISO ICAP was chosen due to its relatively simple design (there are no forward capacity requirements), and well-established nature. The conceptualization was then adapted to the existing EMLab model. From this conceptual model a pseudo code for the formal model was created, and then implemented in the software. After a lengthy process of verification, the experimental set-up was designed to reflect 1. a sensitivity analysis to <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> design parameters such as price cap and slope. 2. the effect of a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> in a single country, with and without target investment in renewable energy 3. the effect of a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> in a two country scenario, with one of the countries having an energy-only market, also with and without target investment in renewable energy. The insights from the model are mainly that the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> works as intended, improves the performance of the electricity sector in general, affects the adequacy and therefore the stability of the power system, affects the type of generation portfolio that might arise as a result. Specifically, On <b>Capacity</b> <b>Market</b> Design - The performance of the electricity market is highly sensitive to the price cap and slope of the <b>capacity</b> <b>market.</b> To ensure the desired level of adequacy in the system, the price cap in the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> must be sufficiently high (1. 5 times CONE) to incentivize and induce investment. If a low price cap (say, CONE) is implemented, there could still be sufficient investment signal if the demand curve is relatively flat. A vertical demand curve is detrimental to the electricity market in general, because staggered revenues from the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> hugely increase the volatility in the system, reducing consumer benefit, leading even to negative profits (on an average) for producers. On Cross Border Effects of <b>Capacity</b> <b>Market</b> - The <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> ensures the desired reserve margin in the country where it has been implemented. However it does so at a higher cost to the consumers of that country. The reasoning behind this is explained in the previous chapter. Interestingly, the model suggests that, without export constraints, between the two countries involved, the surplus capacity in the country with the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> dampens investment in the neighbouring country with an energy only market. This even leads to a marginally higher chance of outages in the neighbouring country. On Performance of the <b>Capacity</b> <b>Market</b> with Substantial Renewable Energy - Simulations suggest that reserve margins may need to be increased if the same level of reliability were to be maintained in a scenario with substantial renewable energy generation. Although the choice of capacity mechanism is highly dependant on the context, this work does not intend to recommend <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> as the solution for problems with the energy only market. However, this research provides valuable insight into <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> design, on the effects if the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> on producers and consumers, and in other relevant scenarios as described above.

40|$|A <b>Capacity</b> <b>Market</b> that Makes Sense," (with Steven Stoft) Electricity Journal, 18, 43 - 54, August/September 2005. We {{argue that}} a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> is needed in most {{restructured}} electricity markets, and present a design that avoids problems found in the early <b>capacity</b> <b>markets.</b> The proposed <b>market</b> only rewards <b>capacity</b> that contributes to reliability as demonstrated by its performance during hours {{in which there is}} a shortage of operating reserves. The capacity price responds to market conditions, increasing when and where capacity is scarce and decreasing to zero when and where it is plentiful. Market power in the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> is addressed by basing the capacity price on actual capacity, rather than bid capacity, so generators cannot increase the capacity price by withholding supply. Actual peak energy rents (the short-run energy and reserve profits of a benchmark peaking unit) are subtracted from the capacity price. This allows the <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> to more accurately control short-run profits and suppresses market power in the energy market. This design both avoids and hedges energy market risk, and by suppressing market power avoids regulatory risk. Risk reduction saves consumers money as do the performance and investment incentives inherent in the pay-for-performance mechanism...|$|R
