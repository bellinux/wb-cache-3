50|$|The cover art {{was done}} by Craik himself and {{features}} {{an early version of}} what become the Stillman logo, namely the stick figure in the circle. Craik has said that it originally represented a <b>magnifiying</b> glass focused on a person falling off the edge off the world, a theme from the lyrics of the title track. The image seemed to strike a chord with listeners of the album and it was variously interpreted as a man floating in a bubble or even grown in a petri dish. Craik adopted it as the logo and after this EP the hand-drawn version appears on the covers of all his subsequent releases in some form.|$|E
