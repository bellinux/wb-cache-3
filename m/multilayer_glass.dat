5000|$|BLITS (Ball Lens In The Space) is a Russian {{satellite}} {{launched on}} September 17, 2009, as a secondary payload on a Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.The satellite is totally passive and spherical, and is tracked using {{satellite laser ranging}} by the International Laser Ranging Service. The purpose of the mission is experimental verification of the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept as well as obtaining SLR data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity [...] The design of BLITS {{is based on the}} optical Luneburg lens concept. The retroreflector is a <b>multilayer</b> <b>glass</b> sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights. A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the METEOR-3M spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.The satellite body consists of two outer hemispheres (radius 85.16 mm) made of a low-refraction-index glass and an inner ball lens (radius 53.52 mm) made of a high-refraction-index glass; the two outer hemispheres and the inner ball are glued together, and one of the outer hemispheres is externally coated with a reflective coating, covered with a protective varnish. The total mass is 7.53 kg.The satellite was inserted into an 832 km Sun-synchronous orbit, with an inclination of 98.85º. The satellite was spinning at a spin period of 5.6 seconds around the axis normal to its orbit plane, allowing laser light to be reflected in short bursts because only half of the satellite is covered in a reflective coating. Being the satellite made of glass, minimum in-flight slowdown of spin rate was expected, as there were no conducting parts where currents interacting with the Earth magnetic field can be induced.The expected operative life was at least 5 years, but the mission was interrupted in 2013 after a collision with space debris.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the deflection of glass panels under wind pressure is important in designing external facades of buildings. A direct method to compute the large deflections of glass panels under uniform loads such as wind pressure is presented. The model allows for derivation of the load-deflection response of square or rectangular <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> panels subject to uniform loads. The boundary conditions examined are those of four-point discontinuous supports or continuous supports along the four sides. With some assumptions on bending and membrane action of flat glasses, simple analytical expressions were derived from the elastic theory. Viscoelastic effects for <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> panels with a thin interlayer of PVB were taken into account by introducing a time-dependent equivalent thickness, as suggested in the literature. The mechanical model based on the structural behavior of equivalent beams is also able {{to account for the}} flexural and membrane actions. Different experimental results available in the literature and relative to flexural tests on out-of-plane loaded, large-scale panels made of laminated structural glass were utilized to validate the model. The model was compared satisfactorily with numerical results obtained by using nonlinear FEMs and with existing analytical models. In almost all cases, the comparison was satisfactory, and the proposed model provides a useful design instrument that allows one to determine the minimum thickness of <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> panels while respecting maximum allowable deflection and strength criteria...|$|R

40|$|A {{miniature}} co-extrusion technique, {{to produce}} a concentric <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> fiber-optic preform of ~ 3 mm diameter, is modeled and experimentally demonstrated. A three-dimensional, incompressible, noncavitating, and nonisothermal Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, similar to one developed in our previous work, is used to predict the dimensions of an alternating four-layer glass stack feed required to produce the desired layer dimensions in a multilayered-glass preform extrudate, using a miniaturized and thus more economical co-extrusion. Strong agreement in the cross-sectional geometrical proportions of the simulated and experimentally obtained preform supports the prowess of the predictive modeling. Nevertheless, some small deviations between the simulated and experimentally obtained dimensions indicate topics for future rheological study. Performing the co-extrusion process under vacuum helps to minimize the inter-layer defects in the multi-layered fiber-optic preform. The miniature co-extrusion potentially removes {{the need for a}} postextrusion draw-down prior to fiber drawing, avoiding devitrification issues possible in non-oxide novel glass compositions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{simplified}} expressions for the calculus {{of the load}} carrying capacity of glass columns having rectangular, tee (T) and cruciform (X) transverse cross-sections are proposed and verified against available experimental data.

Case of full connections and absence of connections are considered to determine the range of variation of expressions adopted. The comparison between the analytical and the experimental results highlights {{that in the case of}} columns or beam-like elements having rectangular cross-sections the flexural buckling resistance governs the load carrying capacity of columns, while in the case of glass columns with X and T cross-sections failure due to torsional buckling effects strongly limits the load carrying capacity of members, also penalized by the glued connection failure...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} appreciable heat and {{acoustic}} insulating properties, insulated glass units (IGUs) are largely used in modern buildings to realize energetically efficient curtain walls. The typical insulated glass unit constitutes a <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> combination, obtained by enclosing a hermetically-sealed air space between {{two or more}} glass panels. The deformations of the coupled system typically derive from external usual loads (e. g. wind loads) but also from internal loads (climatic loads), which depend {{on a series of}} not easily valuable factors (geometry of the element, temperature, pressure or altitude variations). In the practice, additional loading conditions could compromise their integrity, as for example the particular configurations depending on the deformability of the bearing structure or on the restrained thermal expansion. Because of these reasons, in this paper the results of a numerical investigation concerning the behavior of IGUs under many load conditions are presented. In particular, the buckling resistance of IGUs in compression is discussed, by proposing a simple analytical formulation for the estimation of their load carrying capacity...|$|R

The simulation results are compared with results from recently published experiments. Many of the damage morphologies reported in the experiments are captured by the peridynamic results. Some finer details seen in experiments and not replicated by the computational model due to limitations in available computational resources that limited the spatial resolution of the model, and to the simple contact conditions between the layers instead of the polyurethane bonding used in the experiments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{characterization}} of surfaces, interfaces and interphases in glasses is analytically challenging and {{may benefit from}} recent developments in radiofrequency glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (r. f.

GDOES for the {{characterization of}} glass surfaces, physical heterogeneities such as discrete layers and continuous interphases and the distribution of elements in glass materials. Model glasses with increasing structural and chemical complexity thus were analysed using a Jobin Yvon GDOES system (5000 RF) : the <b>glasses</b> included a <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> (triple-coated glass), two photoreactive glasses (with potential chemical diffusion gradients) and acid-leached glass with an alteration layer. Concurrently, surface characterization of the glasses was conducted using scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray imaging to assess the chemical and physical gradients in the materials and to investigate the glow discharge sputtering process. From this the capability of r. f. GDOES for elemental depth profiling in glass materials is established. However, although the sputtering rates for glass are greatly reduced compared with conductive materials (∼ 2 nm s− 1 compared with 50 – 150 nm s− 1 for metals), r. f. GDOES offers good spatial depth resolution (nm) and elemental sensitivity for several applications, such as the characterization of interfaces or interphases and the determination of chemical gradients in glasses. Furthermore, the technique distinguishes submicrometre discrete layers in the coated glass, and the diffusion of elements within glass matrices may be monitored...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} resin cement color on the post-cementation shade of thin laminate veneers milled from <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> ceramic blocks for each layer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thin slices (N = 180) with two thicknesses (A: 8 × 8 × 0. 55 mm and B: 8 × 8 × 0. 8 mm; n = 90 /group) were obtained from <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> ceramic blocks using a diamond saw. Resin die specimens were prepared (8 × 8 × 4 mm) (n = 180) and divided into two resin cement colors (D: - 3. L: + 3) and one control group (C: translucent). Each slice was luted to the composite specimens using a dual-curing resin cement under a constant load of 250 g and light-polymerized for 120 seconds. Specimens were placed on a white background and CIELab values for each layer of the blank slices (incisal [In], body [Bo], and cervical [Ce]) were recorded using a dental contact spectrophotometer. The values were calculated as ΔE, and the data were statistically analyzed (one-way ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk). RESULTS Mean ΔE values for A and B were significant (p < 0. 05) for In (A: 6. 2 ± 1. 1; B: 6. 6 ± 1. 2), Bo (A: 5. 1 ± 2. 6; B: 3. 9 ± 1), and Ce (A: 5. 3 ± 2. 7; B: 3. 8 ± 1. 2). Mean ΔE values for In for D and L for A and B groups were significantly higher (6. 3 ± 1. 2; 6. 6 ± 1. 2) than Bo and Ce for D (4. 4 ± 2. 4; 4. 6 ± 2. 6) and L (4. 6 ± 1. 4; 4. 5 ± 1. 7) groups (p < 0. 05), respectively. Mean differences between Bo and Ce for A and B groups were insignificant (p ≥ 0. 05), while for In the differences were significant. Mean differences between Bo and Ce for A (5. 1 ± 2. 6; 5. 3 ± 2. 7) and for B (3. 9 ± 1; 3. 5 ± 1. 2) groups were insignificant (p ≥ 0. 05), while for In the differences were significant (6. 2 ± 1. 1 for A and 6. 6 ± 1. 2 for B). CONCLUSION The color changes for body and cervical regions of multilayered ceramic veneers were not affected by resin color or ceramic thickness, but the incisal area was affected.

Within such context the glazing systems {{play a key role}} in achieving high levels of sound insulation. The characteristics of sound insulation of such systems can be determined by analytical methods that make use of experimental characterizations of the physical and mechanical parameters of these systems. In this work a combined experimental and analytical approach for sound transmission loss prediction of glazing systems is presented. In particular, the mechanical properties of monolithic and <b>multilayer</b> <b>glasses</b> with viscoelastic interlayer made of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) are measured using resonance curve method of flexural waves on glass beams with different boundary conditions. In order to achieve reliable input mechanical data (Young’s modulus and loss factor), tested beams are characterized in free-free and elastic constraints boundary conditions, respectively. The elastic constrain boundary conditions are realized following the same specifications of ISO Standard 10140 series for larger panels. Starting from the proposed mechanical characterization, the diffuse field sound transmission loss of glass panels has been predicted through an analytical model for solid elastic layers. Results from the above-mentioned procedure are compared with laboratory measurements. From the analysis it will be shown a better accuracy in determining the sound transmission loss of panels when the elastic constrain boundary conditions are applied to the representative beams...|$|R

Small and medium size glass beams were tested and load–deflection curves and crack patterns at failure were recorded. The laminated glass specimens, of equal cross-section, were characterised by three different combinations of annealed float and fully thermally tempered glass plies and different interlayers. Steel joints constituted by double web angles to connect two glass beams were tested adopting several geometrical configurations and using stainless steel bolts preloaded with two different preloading values.

The joints tested were the semi-rigid type, which only make it possible to activate small percentages of the flexural capacity of beams. In all cases examined brittle failure in the glass beams was observed due to stress concentration near the hole, highlighting the importance of the choice of an adequate distance from the hole and the edges of the beams and of the study of an appropriate interface material for connections between glass panels and steel members in the case of both preloaded and non-preloaded bolts...|$|E

40|$|Statement of problem. The {{ultimate}} goal of denture repair is to restore the denture's original strength and avoid further fracture. The best materials and methods for repair have not been conclusively determined. Purpose. This study investigated the fracture force, deflection at fracture, and toughness of a heat-polymerized denture base material repaired with heat-polymerized resin, autopolymerized resin alone, or autopolymerized resin with glass fiber or wire reinforcement. Material and methods. Eight groups were evaluated: 6 with autopolymerized resin repairs, 1 with heat-polymerized resin repairs, and a control group of intact specimens. The 6 autopolymerized resin groups included 1 group xvith no reinforcement, 1 treated with microwave irradiation after polymerization, 2 with monolayer or <b>multilayer</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforcement, and 2 with round or braided wire reinforcement. Each group consisted of 12 specimens. The experimental specimens were cut, and a 3 -mm butt joint gap was repaired {{as indicated by the}} group assignment. A 3 -point bending test was used to determine the fracture force, deflection at fracture, and toughness of the specimens. The data were analyzed with 1 -way analysis of variance and the Tukey post-hoc test (alpha=. 05). Results. The fracture force (28. 4 to 73. 4 N), deflection (1. 6 to 3. 8 mm), and toughness (0. 02 to 0. 13 J) values for all repaired groups were significantly lower than those for the control group (82. 79 N, 4. 4 mm, and 0. 16 J, respectively), with one exception: the mean fracture force of specimens reinforced with round wire (102. 9 N). Failure mode was always adhesive, meaning that fracture occurred between the denture base and repair resin. Conclusion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of 7 chapters, examines the heat transfer between window frames and building walls, {{which has not been}} evaluated nor taken into consideration to date in Japan, and summarizes the results. The summary of each chapter is as follows. In Chapter 1 as introduction, the features, roles, and present state of windows were described, and the crucial importance of correctly evaluating the thermal performance of openings was emphasized. In addition, what’s the heat transfer between window frames and building walls like was explained, and the social background, objectives, and positioning of this study were also described. In Chapter 2, regarding the heat transfer between window frames and building walls, the results of conducing computational evaluation were summarized. First, the importance of evaluating the heat transfer between window frames and building walls using liner thermal transmittance (Ψ_b) was described, and the calculation method for Ψ_b was proposed. Then, computational software in use, TB 2 D/BEM, was roughly introduced, and the verification of its precision was also performed. As a result, it was confirmed that TB 2 D/BEM is the computational software that has precision sufficient for the application standards of JIS A 2102 - 2. Successively, Ψ_b of the typical combinations between window frames and building walls that are commonly used in Japan was obtained, and the results were discussed. In addition, comparison was made between Ψ_b and Ψ_g, which is the liner thermal transmittance of the glass spacer part of <b>multilayered</b> <b>glass.</b> <b>Multilayered</b> <b>glass</b> is the evaluation target of the thermal performance of windows at present. The value of Ψ_b in a large case was about twice that of Ψ_g. In addition, the effect of change in the thermal performance of building walls on Ψ_b was confirmed, and it was shown that change in the thermal performance of building walls hardly had effect on it. In Chapter 3, regarding the heat transfer between window frames and building windows, the results of conducting experimental evaluation were summarized. First, the outline of a measurement apparatus was described. Then, the measurement results were shown, and they were compared with the calculation results. The results show that although the heat flow directions agreed with each other, the heat flow quantities differed. In addition, the factors for difference in the heat flow quantities were picked up, and it was concluded that a larger factor among them for the difference came probably from the distribution of heat transfer coefficient. In Chapter 4, regarding the distribution of heat transfer coefficient of window, measurement results were summarized. Since difference factor between the measurement results and the calculation results was highly considered due to the distribution of heat transfer coefficient as mentioned in Chapter 3, measurement of the distribution of heat transfer coefficient was performed. Here, the outline of measurement apparatus, measurement method, and measurement results were reported, and the results were discussed. In Chapter 5, regarding the distribution of heat transfer coefficient of window, calculation results were summarized. First, the outline of an analytical model and the analytical results were described. Then, the distribution of heat transfer coefficient as the analytical results was compared with the distribution of heat transfer coefficient as the measurement results obtained in Chapter 4, and the consistency of the analysis was confirmed. In addition, the distribution of heat transfer coefficient of the part that cannot be grasped by measurement was grasped. In Chapter 6, the effect of the heat transfer between window frames and building walls on the thermal performance of buildings was summarized. As the items used to confirm the effect, the thermal transmittance of window U value and the heat loss coefficient of buildings Q value were picked up, and the calculation, when Ψb was added to each of U value and Q value, was performed. As a result, the increment of the values in a large case was about 25 % for U value and about 5 % for Q value, which showed that the effect was not small. In Chapter 7, discussion results and findings obtained in this study were summarized as the conclusions. In addition, challenges to be solved in future studies were organized, and future prospects were described. 理工学研究科博士論文(工学); 学位取得日: 平成 25 年 3 月 25 日鹿児島大...|$|R

30|$|It {{was shown}} in {{experiments}} that surface plasmon losses in various plasmonic structures are virtually insensitive to temperature change. A PMMA/Ta 2 O 5 /Au <b>multilayer</b> on <b>glass</b> substrate has almost the same transmission spectrum at wavelength range 550 to 800  nm measured in temperatures from 80 to 350  K [10]. The decrease of electrical resistivity of silver with the reduction of temperature does not influence the surface plasmon loss. The imaginary part of electric permittivity of silver, which is inversely proportional to the ohmic conductivity, changes with temperature but depends mostly on the silver film thickness. Thus, {{it is not the}} ohmic losses due to electron scattering in silver but the temperature-independent morphology of the silver surface that decides on losses due to scattering into free space [2]. The above conclusion is in agreement with recently observed maxima in the visible range of the transmittance spectra of Ag/MgF 2 /Ag [11], Ag/ITO/Ag [12], and ZnO/Ag/ZnO [13] multilayers, which clearly depend on Ag surface morphology.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{experimental}} study, {{under conditions}} of static loading, load-bearing performance of pin connected <b>multilayered</b> (angle-ply) <b>glass</b> fiber-rein-forced polyphenylenesulphide matrix composites with [(0 / 90) ] 4 s and [(0 / 90) / (+/ 45) ] 2 s stacking sequence was analyzed. The experiments were carried out according to the ASTM D 953. The ratio of the distance between pin center and sample end, to pin diameter E/D; and the ratio of sample width to pin diameter W/D, were changed systematically during the experiments. From {{the results of the}} experiment, maximum bearing failure loads were obtained for [(0 / 90) /(+/ 45) ] 2 s lay-up with geometric parameters of D 10 mm andW/D 2. Macro images belong-ing to failure modes, which occurred as results of the tests were examined. In addition to this, from the fractographic examinations carried out with scanning electron micro-scope, it was concluded that the geometric parameters intimately affect fracture morphology...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and testing}} {{results of a}} 65 -pin ceramic packaged 4 × 4 arrayed position sensitive detector are presented. The detector, consisting of 16 tetra-lateral sensitive areas, is a p-n-n+ configuration made on 3 -in. n-type high resistance crystal silicon substrates. A 100 -nm antireflection SiO 2 thin film is formed on the surface, along with a <b>multilayer</b> cover <b>glass</b> with transmissivity > 98 % from 400 to 950 nm. Primary tests of the device show {{that it has a}} low dark current, high spectral sensitivity, very fast response speed, and very good linearity. The dark current of an element unit is less than 20 nA, which is the allowable maximum dark current. The peak spectral sensitivity of the sensor is over 505 mA/W at 800 -nm wavelength. Its response time is 8 ns at 45 -V reverse bias and the nonlinearity of the total sensitive area is less than 1 %. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (vertical and lateral) {{structure of}} Cd-arachidate multilayers prepared {{on two different}} substrates, glass and silicon, is studied simultaneously by grazing incidence x-ray reflection/diffraction. The grazing incidence reflectivity studies indicate {{the formation of a}} well-ordered layered structure on both the substrates. The reflectivity simulations show that the bilayer spacing {{in the case of a}} glass substrate is 5. 54 nm while that on a silicon substrate is only 5. 44 nm, indicating a vertical tilt of the Cd-arachidate molecules on a glass substrate by about 9. 5 degrees. The interface roughness is found to be 0. 3 nm for <b>multilayers</b> on a <b>glass</b> substrate and 0. 4 nm on the silicon substrate. The interface topography, determined by studying the nonspecular scattering behavior, is found to be replicated between the various interfaces in the multilayers, independent of the type of substrate. The lateral topography of the interfaces in <b>multilayers</b> on a <b>glass</b> substrate shows a self-affine nature with no lateral length limit for the roughness fluctuations. The interfaces in multilayers on a silicon substrate, however, exhibit a saturation behavior for the roughness fluctuations. In the plane of the multilayers the Cd-arachidate molecules on a glass substrate have a centered rectangular lattice arrangement while they have a distorted hexagonal lattice arrangement on a silicon substrate.

40|$|Localized plastic {{deformation}} known as shear banding is a prominent feature in metallic glasses. In {{this study we}} perform parametric three-dimensional finite ele- ment analyses, using primarily {{a thin layer of}} metallic glass on top of a cylindrical base, to study how physical constraint can affect this localized form of deformation and the corresponding macroscopic stress-strain response. Random perturbation points are added to the metallic glass model to facilitate the formation of shear bands. The modeling result suggests that the mechanical behavior of metallic glasses can be significantly influenced by the geometrical confinement. Under nominally uniaxial compressive loading, a lower thickness-to-diameter ratio results in higher plastic flow stresses. Shear bands tend to concentrate in regions away from the interface with the base material. The findings provide a mechanistic rationale for experimental ob- servations based on the micropillar compression test. The deformation pattern in a <b>multilayered</b> metallic <b>glass</b> structure as well as the deformation pattern in a metallic glas beam subjected to four point bending are also examined.

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{potentials}} of glass as a construction material, its brittle material behaviour poses major challenges to structural engineers when designing load-bearing glass structural members. This paper presents the load response {{and the failure}} behaviour of float glass–GFRP hybrid beams, when used as a mean of improving strength and ductility of float glass. Hybrid beams made from two layers of float glass sheets and an adhesively-bonded semi-transparent pre-cured GFRP interlayer were tested in four-point bending. The experimental results showed that double layer hybrid beams continued to take load even after {{the formation of the}} first major crack, and the beams were stronger and ductile than conventional single and <b>multilayer</b> float <b>glass</b> beams. Once the bottom glass layer has cracked the combination of the GFRP and the top glass layer carried the applied load whilst the gradual decrease in the stiffness due to the formation of new cracks ensures a ductile failure. Experimentally-validated finite element (FE) models that predict the evolution of stresses, stiffness and failure load of single and double layer glass beams, and glass– GFRP hybrid beams are also presented...|$|R
