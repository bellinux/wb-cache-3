40|$|IntroductionTransoral laser {{microsurgery}} (TLM) {{represents one of}} the most effective treatment strategies for Tis–T 2 glottic squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The prognostic influence of close/positive margins is still debated, and the role of narrow band imaging (NBI) in their intraoperative definition is still to be validated on large cohort of patients. This study analyzed the influence of margin status on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). MethodsWe retrospectively studied 507 cases of pTis–T 1 b (Group A) and 127 cases of pT 2 (Group B) glottic SCC. We identified the following margin status: negative (n[*]=[*] 232), close superficial (n[*]=[*] 79), close deep (CD) (n[*]=[*] 35), positive single superficial (n[*]=[*] 146), positive <b>multiple</b> <b>superficial</b> (n[*]=[*] 94), and positive deep (n[*]=[*] 48) and analyzed their impact on RFS and DSS. Close margins were defined by tumor-margin distance < 1 [*]mm. Pre-TLM margins were defined by white light in 323 patients, whereas NBI was employed in 311 patients. ResultsIn Group A, DSS and RFS were reduced in positive <b>multiple</b> <b>superficial</b> and positive deep margins (DSS[*]=[*] 96. 1 and 97 %, both p[*]<[*] 0. 05; RFS[*]=[*] 72 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001 and 75. 8 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In Group B, DSS was reduced in positive <b>multiple</b> <b>superficial</b> margins (82. 4 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). RFS was reduced in positive single <b>superficial,</b> positive <b>multiple</b> <b>superficial,</b> and positive deep margins (62. 5, 41. 2, and 53. 3 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In the entire population, RFS was reduced in CD margins (77. 1 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Use of NBI led to improvement in RFS and DSS. ConclusionThe study indicates that close and positive single superficial margins do not affect DSS. By contrast, all types of margin positivity predict the occurrence of relapses, albeit with different likelihood, depending on stage/margin type. CD margins should be considered as a single risk factor. Use of NBI granted better intraoperative margins definition...|$|R

Although its treatment is typically surgical, in literature the approach used is variable and extends from diathermocoagulation to omphalectomy. Such <b>superficial</b> <b>treatments</b> for umbilical endometriosis can predispose the patient to a relapse of the disease. We here present seven cases of umbilical endometriosis treated with radical surgery with a laparoscopically-assisted approach, with a complete and long-term disease-free follow-up. CasesSeven cases of umbilical endometriosis, four of which relapsing from a prior <b>superficial</b> <b>treatment,</b> were treated radically with a laparoscopically-assisted approach, with a long-term disease-free follow-up. ConclusionAlthough a medical treatment can be considered, the treatment of choice in these patients should be that of excisional surgery {{so as to avoid}} lesion relapse and the risk of oncogenic transformation.

The {{evaluation}} of injuries due to self-mutilation may be complicated by atypical lesions and fabricated {{histories of the}} causative events. Four cases are described {{where one of the}} most striking findings was the presence of "mirror-image" injuries and/or a "chessboard" pattern of intersecting parallel lines from self-inflicted incised wounds. Case 1 : A 32 -year-old man was dead in his burnt-out car, with symmetrical, "mirror-image", circular burns from the car cigarette lighter over his forehead, cheeks, ears, upper and lower arms, the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hands, the anterior chest wall including the nipples, the anterior abdomen, thighs, lower legs, and the back of his neck. The deceased had a history of psychotic depression and had died of burns and inhalation of products of combustion. Case 2 : A 19 -year-old woman who fabricated a history of assault demonstrated <b>multiple,</b> <b>superficial,</b> "mirror-image" injuries of her thighs and forearms. Case 3 : A 32 -year-old man who exsanguinated from cut wrists showed <b>multiple,</b> <b>superficial,</b> and "mirror-image" incised wounds of the wrists, with a "chessboard" pattern. Case 4 : A 26 -year-old man died after jumping from a building. He had <b>multiple</b> <b>superficial,</b> "mirror-image" incised wounds of his anterior chest and thighs, with a typical "chessboard" pattern. Given the difficulties that sometimes arise in determining whether injuries have been self-inflicted or not, the finding of symmetrical "mirror-image" injuries, and/or a "chessboard" pattern formed by 2 groups of regular, parallel, superficial incised wounds running at right angles to each other provides compelling evidence of self-mutilation, unless a plausible alternative explanation is available...|$|R

Sixty specimens (n = 10) were made with composite resin (Z 250, 3 M) and thermocycled with 500 cycles, oscillating between 5 to 55 A degrees C. The specimens were randomly separated in six groups which suffered the following <b>superficial</b> treatments: no <b>treatment</b> (GI, control), wearing with diamond bur (GII), sandblasted with aluminum oxide with 27. 5 A mu m particles (GIII) for 10 s, 200 mJ Er:YAG laser (GIV), 300 mJ Er:YAG laser (GV), and 400 mJ Er:YAG laser (GVI), with the last 3 groups under a 10 Hz frequency for 10 s. Restoration repair was done using the same composite. The shear test was done into the Universal testing machine MTS- 810.
