Literature of steel <b>pipe</b> <b>culverts</b> related to construction practices and common types of culvert failures and their appropriate mitigation measures were reviewed. A detailed field survey was conducted to detect failures and defects appeared on the existing culverts.

The design mistakes and poor construction were detected as the main causes of culverts failures. For sustainability of the culverts, various remedial measures are recommended to be considered in urgent rehabilitation of the existing crossings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Buried {{corrugated}} steel culverts are universally {{regarded as a}} structure with strong deformation adaptability and dispersed the upper load by {{corrugated steel}} structures surrounding soil constraints to enhance the carrying capacity {{and the use of}} soil-structure interaction. A lot of factors influence the earth pressure of the buried corrugated steel culvert, such as culvert stiffness, physical characteristics of the backfill (bulk density, deformation modulus and internal friction angle), geometry of structure and backfilling height. The finite element program of ANSYS has been used to research the elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, internal friction angle of soil, inertia moment of corrugated steel plate and pipe diameter affect the rigidity and flexibility of buried corrugated steel culvert. By defining path lines in the finite element post-processing, extracting and comparing the horizontal and vertical directions soil displacements along the lines, and doing impact pa-rameter analysis.

40|$|A {{deteriorated}} concrete {{box culvert}} conveying {{a tributary of}} the Saugeen River under Highway 21 in Ontario had reached the end of its lifespan and was in need of replacement. The tributary supports a diverse range of coldwater fish species such as Rainbow Trout; however, fish passage, particularly upstream migration, has been cut off since the culvert and highway were constructed over seventy-five years ago. Specifically, fish passage has been hindered by shallow sheet flow along the sixty metre flat bottom, excessive velocities associated with the smooth, seven percent gradient, and a perched barrier at the downstream outlet. A key component of the culvert replacement was an effort to improve the overall condition of the tributary’s natural environment, including the promotion of fish passage and migration opportunities. The culvert replacement project undertaken by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and MMM Group, coupled resources with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) Environment office, Parsons biologists, and Aquafor geomorphologists. The most ecologically sensitive replacement methodology of an open bottom structure was not viable for this project as it would have required a full closure of the Highway for approximately four months. A circular steel <b>pipe</b> <b>culvert</b> installed through tunneling was designed to by-pass and replace the existing concrete box culvert. In an effort to mitigate the current barriers to fish with the new <b>pipe</b> <b>culvert,</b> a prefabricated corrugated steel slip liner with engineered baffle arrangement was integrated into the design.

40|$|While {{many studies}} have looked at how large mammals respond to road {{mitigation}} measures, few have examined the effects on smaller mammals nor taken a multispecies approach. I investigated the effectiveness of three different types of wildlife passages along Highway 175 in Quebec for small and medium sized mammals (< 30 kg) using infrared cameras. Wildlife passages (n= 17) were monitored year round from 2012 to 2015. Two research questions were addressed: (1) Does discovery and use differ between passages and if so, why? and (2) Are there differences between species? Global and species-specific models were produced for both discovery and use. A linear mixed-effects model was used for discoveries (log-transformed counts) and a generalized linear mixed model was used for usage (binary response). Species’ responded to the passages differently, with discoveries increasing overall and in particular for marmots (Marmota monax) as latitude increased. <b>Pipe</b> <b>culverts</b> {{were more likely to}} be discovered by micromammals and wooden ledge culverts by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) than other passage types. Older passages were discovered less in general, with the exception of marmots. Marmots were the only species to show a difference in use by passage type, favouring <b>pipe</b> <b>culverts.</b> Passage use was less likely with a median present for all models, except squirrels. More open passages had higher use overall and particularly for marmots and weasels (Mustela sp). In contrast to previous studies, distance to cover and the presence of light were not important predictors. Agencies can engineer increasingly effective wildlife passages by minimizing the barrier effect of the structures themselves and constructing passages better suited to the needs of the species being targeted. To benefit the most species, it is recommended that future projects contain a diversity of open, single segment passages requiring long-term monitoring...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In August 2000, a {{concrete}} <b>pipe</b> <b>culvert</b> of 1370 mm inside diameter was installed under a truck route {{in the former}} Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (now City of Ottawa) using the Standard Installations method.

The performance monitoring conducted over a three-year period showed good correlation with the Standard Installations theory. The measured performance of the pipe from the test site compared to the predicted performance for Standard Installations has resulted in some very informative findings on the interaction between pipe and soil, and provides the owners of infrastructure with design options for concrete pipe.
