5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a <b>mélange</b> <b>of</b> metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E

While the stories explore the comedic and absurd elements of life, they also speak to universal experiences about the things we want, the things we struggle with, and the contradictions implicit in desire. While these stories take the shapes of mysteries, fairy tales, satires, coming-of-age narratives, and <b>melanges</b> <b>of</b> all of these genres and more, they all ultimately reveal {{what it is to be}} human and remind us that the struggles we endure and the triumphs we fight for can occur in the most unlikely of places...|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Desert of Egypt {{is part of}} the Neoproterozoic Arabian-Nubian Shield and {{displays}} different occurrences <b>of</b> Neoproterozoic ophiolitic <b>mélanges.</b> The mélanges contain exotic and native blocks and fragments of variable sizes and types set in a sheared and schistose volcaniclastic matrix. The main exotic blocks are ophiolitic and include metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, metagabbros, massive and pillowed metabasalts and pelagic sedimentary rocks. Based on the mode of occurrences of the ophiolitic components and the processes <b>of</b> <b>mélange</b> formation, the ophiolitic <b>mélanges</b> <b>of</b> the Central Eastern Desert are classified and mapped into tectonic mélange, olistostrome and olistostromal mélange. Both tectonic and sedimentary processes played a major role during mélange formation in a back-arc or inter-arc setting.|$|R
25|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was given}} by the scholar Jevgenij Paščenko; he considered that the Croats were an heterogeneous group of people belonging to the Chernyakhov culture, a poly-ethnic cultural <b>mélange</b> <b>of</b> mostly Slavs and Sarmatians, but also Goths, Getae and Dacians. There was happening an interrelation between Slavic and Iranian language and culture, seen for example in the toponymy. As such, under the ethnonym Hrvati should not be necessary seen a specific or even homogeneous tribe, yet archaic religion and mythology of a heterogeneous group of people of Iranian origin or influence who worshiped the solar deity Hors, from which possibly originates the Croatian ethnonym.|$|E

On 3 September 1970, they occupied Ban Houei Mun, which was stocked as a forward airstrip for the Raven FACs. Beginning 9 September, the two battalions pushed 28 kilometers southeastward into low ground west of Tuomlane. Black Battalion joined them there. Meanwhile, White Battalion, joined by Mobile 2, spent 4–7 September 1970 combing the nearby Route 23 valley.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Fiedler {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} professor at the University of Montana in Missoula. In February 1941 his first son, Kurt, was born two months prematurely. He elected to join the Navy Reserve after the United States entered World War II in December 1941 due to incipient fissures in his marriage and a previously unrequited thirst for adventure. Following enlistment, he gained admission to the Navy's Japanese Language School in Boulder, Colorado, where he was placed in an intensive fourteen-month course taught by a <b>melange</b> <b>of</b> Japanese American businessmen and missionaries. Initially suspected to be a security risk, Fiedler's lieutenant (junior grade) commission was delayed until the conclusion of a comprehensive background investigation; although Baxter Hathaway, a colleague at Montana, declared that Fiedler was a Lovestoneite, the investigator failed to pick up on the allusion.|$|E
40|$|The geology and {{stratigraphy}} of the Archipelago Group {{are reviewed}} and new data presented to improve understanding. Major lithofacies are bioclastic limestones, bioturbated mottled marlstones, micritic limestones, trace fossil-bearing mudstones, quartzose sandstones and reworked volcanic material of Mio-Pliocene and Pleistocene age. The succession overlies the Pre-Neogene submarine fan turbidites and tectonic <b>mélanges</b> <b>of</b> ophiolite derivation and Mithakhari rocks, and is overlain by Quaternary deposits of late Pleistocene–Holocene age. The Neogene sequences were deposited in wave- and current-agitated shallow-marine intertidal and relatively deeper-water subtidal, nearshore and offshore shelfal environments.

25|$|The RLAF {{began its}} {{operations}} as a liaison, logistics and transport unit. Its initial stock were a <b>melange</b> <b>of</b> French and American supplied rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft inherited from its predecessor, Aviation Laotienne. On 9 January 1961, the new RLAF was supplied with six AT-6 Texans {{as its first}} strike aircraft. Although these were quickly lost, they were replaced by five T-28 Trojans. Despite ongoing losses, the T-28 inventory would eventually burgeon under American auspices to 75 Trojans on board in 1973. It would also acquire ten AC-47 gunships for a time. Pilot procurement for the swelling fleet would always be problematic, with the inadequate roster of Lao and Hmong pilots being filled out with Thai mercenary pilots, and a few Americans from Air America. By the time American aid was withdrawn in 1973, dooming the force, the RLAF would total 180 aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters.|$|E
25|$|During the Mesozoic era (about 250 to 66 {{million years}} ago) a large ocean (Tethys Ocean), floored by oceanic {{lithosphere}} existed in-between the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia (which lay {{to the south}} and north respectively; Robertson & Dixon, 2006). This large oceanic plate was consumed at subduction zones (see subduction zone). At the subduction trenches the sedimentary rock layers that were deposited within the prehistoric Tethys Ocean buckled, were folded, faulted and tectonically mixed with huge blocks of crystalline basement rocks of the oceanic lithosphere. These blocks form a very complex mixture or <b>mélange</b> <b>of</b> rocks that include mainly serpentinite, basalt, dolerite and chert (e.g. Bergougnan, 1975). The Eurasian margin, now preserved in the Pontides (the Pontic Mountains along the Black Sea coast), is thought to have been geologically similar to the Western Pacific region today (e.g. Rice et al., 2006). Volcanic arcs (see volcanic arc) and backarc basins (see back-arc basin) formed and were emplaced onto Eurasia as ophiolites (see ophiolite) as they collided with microcontinents (literally relatively small plates of continental lithosphere; e.g. Ustaomer and Robertson, 1997). These microcontinents had been pulled away from the Gondwanan continent further south. Turkey is therefore made up from several different prehistorical microcontinents.|$|E

In remixing the album, Jamie xx incorporated dubstep tones, dance-influenced tempos, pitch-shifted and sped-up samples, wobble, sub-bass, and drum 'n' bass beats into the music. We're New Here also contains elements of trance, house, techno, hip hop breakbeats, and electro music.
