If the master pattern was made from steel, the <b>master</b> <b>die</b> can be cast {{directly}} from the pattern using metal with a lower melting point. Rubber moulds can also be cast directly from the master pattern. Alternatively, a <b>master</b> <b>die</b> can be machined independentlyâ€”without creating a master pattern.|$|R

50|$|It {{was planned}} that the coin would {{continue}} using the voyageur theme of its predecessor, but the <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> {{that had been}} struck in Ottawa were lost in transit {{en route to the}} Mint's facility at Winnipeg. A Commons committee struck to investigate the loss discovered that the Mint had no documented procedures for transport of <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> and that it had shipped them via a local courier in a bid to save $43.50. It was also found to be the third time that the Mint had lost <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> within five years. An internal review by the Royal Canadian Mint argued that while a policy existed to ship the obverse and reverse dies separately, the new coin dies were packaged separately but were part of the same shipment. The Mint also disagreed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's contention that the dies were simply lost in transit, believing instead that they were stolen. The dies were never recovered.|$|R
