25|$|The AN/ASQ-8 <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detector</b> {{was fitted}} in an {{extended}} tail, producing a paper chart. Unmarked charts were not classified, but those with annotations {{were classified as}} secret.|$|E
25|$|Upgraded ASW {{version for}} the Royal Netherlands Navy, powered by Gem 41 engines with no sonar but fitted with towed <b>Magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector.</b> Designated SH-14C in Dutch service, and mainly used for {{training}} and utility purposes. Eight built.|$|E
25|$|In Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, a Victor-class {{submarine}} stakes out a New York-to-Europe convoy {{to reinforce}} NATO against a Soviet attack by {{sitting next to}} the wreck of the Andrea Doria – hoping to confuse <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> readings. USS Reuben James (FFG-57) and HMS Battleaxe (F89), working in conjunction, use their helicopters to find and destroy the submarine.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship has}} hull-mounted medium- and low-frequency {{search and attack}} sonar. The ASW {{helicopters}} have surface search radar, dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{countries}} {{produce their}} own antisubmarine warfare sensors, such as hydrophones, active sonar, <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors,</b> and other hydrographic sensors that are frequently considered too [...] "ordinary" [...] to be called MASINT.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{is made of}} a {{titanium}} alloy, {{which helps}} with signature management {{because it is not}} magnetic. The non-magnetic alloy would greatly reduce the effectiveness of enemy <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> or <b>magnetic</b> limpet mines against this type of vessel.|$|R
25|$|The Nimrod was {{equipped}} with a <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detector</b> (MAD) tail boom. MAD {{was considered to be}} more capable than the Autolycus approach and could also detect submerged submarines operating without diesels or the increasing threat from nuclear submarines. MAD had not been successfully fitted to the Shackleton, possibly because of interference problems from the piston engines and their ignition system.|$|E
25|$|New Delhi and Boeing {{have signed}} a $2.1 billion {{contract}} to deliver 12 P-8I Neptune for anti-submarine operations. The new aircraft will replace {{a fleet of}} Russian-manufactured Tupolev-142M planes. P-8I varies from the P-8A, with the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD) has been kept intact while an aft-mounted radar provides 360-degree aerial radar surveillance capability. Many of the communication and other devices on-board are developed by Bharat Electronics Limited. The first squadron was formed with eight aircraft. When the remaining four join the force, the Tu-142 will be decommissioned.|$|E
25|$|The Albatrosses {{improved}} the sweeping capacity and introduced news technology such as sonar, radar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector.</b> Norway {{did not have}} capacity to sweep its waters and instead focused on the surveillance. This allowed both British and American forces to carry out such tasks. Despite the leap in technology, the Albatrosses were soon declared obsolete. Allied Forces Northern Europe determined that they needed full anti-submarine capabilities and opted to replace the flying boats with the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Five Orions were capable of the same job as eighteen Albatrosses, {{and the number of}} squadrons was cut to one. The 330 Sqn was therefore deactivated on 1 October 1968.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the RAAF {{received}} significantly upgraded AP-3C. Also {{known as}} Australian Orions they are {{fitted with a}} variety of sensors. They include digital multi-mode radar, electronic support measures, electro-optics detectors (infra-red and visual), <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors,</b> identification friend or foe systems, and acoustic detectors. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon is gradually replacing them.|$|R
5|$|The {{military}} determines local {{geomagnetic field}} characteristics, {{in order to}} detect anomalies in the natural background that might {{be caused by a}} significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.|$|R
50|$|Republic of Korea Navy - eight P-3Cs, eight P-3CKs; {{based in}} Pohang Airport and Jeju {{international}} airport. Korean Air/L-3 Communications are upgrading the P-3C aircraft with new electronics, including new <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors,</b> electro-optical sensors, surveillance equipment and a self-protection suite. The Navy's impetus {{stems from a}} 2010 experience in which ROK forces detected only 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises.|$|R
25|$|The P-1 is {{equipped}} with various sensors to enable the aircraft to perform its primary purpose of detecting submarines and surface vessels; these include the Toshiba HPS-106 {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar which uses a total of four antennas to provide 360 degree coverage, and Infrared/Light detection systems for surface detection. The P-1 is also furnished with a CAE Inc.-built <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD) embedded into the aircraft's tail, along with deployable Sonobouys, which is used for the detection of submerged submarines. Sophisticated acoustic systems are also used for this purpose. The P-1 has an artificial intelligence (AI) system to assist TACCO operations; similar to the SH-60K, this advanced combat direction system directs the TACCO operator to the optimal flight course to attack a submarine.|$|E
25|$|The P-8 {{features}} the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar; the P-8I features an international {{version of the}} APY-10. Unlike the preceding P-3, the P-8 lacks a <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD) due to its higher operational altitude; its acoustic sensor system is reportedly more effective at acoustic tracking and thus lacking a MAD won't impede its detection capabilities; India's P-8I {{is equipped with a}} MAD per the contract request. Various sensor data are combined via data fusion software to track targets. Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin's Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the Navy's requirement. During the P-8A Increment 2 upgrade in 2016, the APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) will be replaced by the Advanced Airborne Sensor radar.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod {{design was}} based on that of the Comet 4 civil {{airliner}} which had {{reached the end of}} its commercial life (the first two prototype Nimrods, XV148 & XV147 were built from two final unfinished Comet 4C airframes). The Comet's turbojet engines were replaced by Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans for better fuel efficiency, particularly at the low altitudes required for maritime patrol. Major fuselage changes were made, including an internal weapons bay, an extended nose for radar, a new tail with electronic warfare (ESM) sensors mounted in a bulky fairing, and a MAD (<b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector)</b> boom. After the first flight in May 1967, the RAF ordered a total of 46 Nimrod MR1s. The first example (XV230) entered service in October 1969. A total of five squadrons using the type were established; four were permanently based in the UK and a fifth was initially based in Malta.|$|E
50|$|Military {{submarines}} are degaussed—by {{passing through}} large underwater loops at regular intervals—to help them escape detection by sea-floor monitoring systems, <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors,</b> and magnetically-triggered mines. However, submarines are never completely de-magnetised. It {{is possible to}} tell the depth at which a submarine has been by measuring its magnetic field, which is distorted as the pressure distorts the hull and hence the field. Heating can also change the magnetization of steel.|$|R
50|$|Especially for anti-submarine warfare, {{most modern}} frigates have a landing deck and hangar aft to operate helicopters, {{eliminating}} the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as sonobuoys, wire-mounted dipping sonar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> to identify possible threats, and torpedoes or depth-charges to attack them.|$|R
50|$|The B5N {{served as}} the basis for a {{follow-on}} design, the B6N, which eventually replaced it in front line service. The B5N continued to fly in secondary roles, such as training, target towing, and anti-submarine warfare. Some of the aircraft used for this latter purpose were equipped with early radars and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors.</b> B5Ns were also used as bombers during the unsuccessful defence of the Philippines in October 1944, suffering severe losses. Later in the war, they were also used for kamikaze attacks.|$|R
25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Ward Island had {{many of the}} same topics at the three ARM Secondary Schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy’s airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust – often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. Microwave radar, which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their mechanical drives. Sonar was not included, but there was more attention given to recognition (IFF), direction-finding, and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1).|$|E
500|$|In 1942 {{when the}} United States was {{preparing}} to fight a long, technically challenging war, Hilliard left MGM to join his friend Blackburn who had begun research for Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to work on radar development for U.S. military applications. His work at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts led in 1943 to an employment opportunity back in Los Angeles at Altec Lansing where he improved their <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detector</b> (MAD, also known as [...] "Magnetic Airborne Detection") system for Anti-submarine warfare (ASW).|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{government}} consequently ordered Tupolev {{and other}} aircraft design bureaus to study possible dedicated anti-submarine warfare (ASW) designs. Tupolev initially designed the Tu-95PLO (protivolodochnaya oborona, or ASW), a {{development of the}} Tu-95 equipped with sonobuoys, anti-submarine mines and torpedoes. It was to carry a [...] (...) payload with a maximum loiter time of [...] The design was dropped, however, because it lacked a powerful radar, thermal imaging (infrared) system and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD). On , the Council of Ministers (the highest executive and administrative body of the Soviet Union) issued a directive to Tupolev requiring his bureau to develop a long-range ASW aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Two USN K-class blimps {{completed}} the first transatlantic crossing by non-rigid airships when they landed at Craw Field, Port Lyautey {{on the evening}} of June 1, 1944. Blimp Squadron 14 airships K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 on June 15 and K-101 and K-112 on July 1, 1944. The K-ships flew nighttime antisubmarine patrols using <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> (MAD) while the PBY Catalinas from Fleet Air Wing 15 flew the dayshift, creating a 24/7 magnetic fence across the Straits of Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|From 1955, the West German Bundesmarine {{was allowed}} to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, West Germany re-entered the {{submarine}} business. Because Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the Bundesmarine focused on small coastal submarines {{to protect against the}} Soviet threat in the Baltic Sea. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as amagnetic steel to protect against naval mines and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> {{employed}} to detect submarines during World War II harnessed the fluxgate magnetometer, an inexpensive {{and easy to}} use technology developed in the 1930s by Victor Vacquier of Gulf Oil for finding ore deposits. [...] MAD gear was used by both Japanese and U.S. anti-submarine forces, either towed by ship or mounted in aircraft to detect shallow submerged enemy submarines. The Japanese called the technology jikitanchiki (磁気探知機, [...] "Magnetic Detector"). After the war, the U.S. Navy continued to develop MAD gear as a parallel development with sonar detection technologies.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{mission of}} the group was the development of equipment and tactics best suited for aerial anti-submarine warfare. [...] Among the devices that the group helped develop or test were the radar altimeter, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector,</b> the sonobuoy, improved airborne depth charges, long-range navigation systems, and airborne microwave radar.|$|E
2500|$|Redesignated as AF-2W (TB3F-1S) and AF-2S (TB3F-2S), the Guardian entered fleet {{service on}} 27 September 1950 with three {{aircraft}} delivered to VS-24, with full service introduction shortly after with VS-25. A total of 193 AF-2S Guardians were built. In 1952, the [...] AF-3S (hunter) was introduced, fitting a <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD) {{for the detection}} of submerged submarines; 40 of this variant were built. The last Guardian was delivered to the Navy in March 1953, with a total of 389 built.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} device {{tested by}} the group was the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD). [...] MAD could sense changes in the earth's magnetic field, as could be produced by a submarine's steel hull. Aircraft outfitted with this device would patrol {{in an area where}} a submarine had been spotted but had submerged. Combined with the use of sonobuoys to listen for the sounds of a submarine, MAD provided a high probability of conducting a successful attack. [...] The group conducted its first operation using MAD on 13 July 1942 and located a submarine which had been damaged in a previous attack.|$|E
2500|$|From 1955, the West German Bundesmarine {{was allowed}} to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired.

50|$|Attack {{submarines}} (SSKs and SSNs) {{were developed}} to include faster, longer range and more discriminating torpedoes. This, coupled with improvements to sonar systems, made ballistic missile submarines more vulnerable to attack submarines and also increased the anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities of attack subs. SSBNs themselves as well as cruise-missile submarines (SSGNs) were fitted with increasingly more accurate and longer range missiles and received the greatest noise reduction technology. To counter this increasing threat torpedoes were honed to target submarines more effectively and new anti-submarine missiles and rockets {{were developed to}} give ships a longer-range anti-submarine capability. Ships, submarines and maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) also received increasingly effective technology for locating submarines, e.g. <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> (MAD) and improved sonar.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and {{continued}} to hold the technological advantage from 1943. A brief threat, {{in the shape of the}} German Type XXI submarine emerged but was too late to alter the course of the war. Technological answers to the Type XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|R
2500|$|CL-605 MSA: A {{maritime}} patrol aircraft design under development by Boeing. [...] Boeing has proposed a repackaging {{of some of the}} Boeing P-8 Poseidon sensors but not weapons into a less expensive airframe, the Bombardier Challenger 605 business jet. This aircraft is named Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) and has been depicted with the AN/APY-10 radar, an electro-optical sensor in a retractable turret, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector.</b> On February 28, 2014, a MSA demonstrator which is a modified CL-604 made its first flight, but the final aircraft will use the CL-605 airframe. The demonstrator currently has the external shapes for the sensors and communications systems which will be added later. The final MSA is expected to cost $55 million to $60 million per aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher {{added that}} [...] "there is a known {{magnetic}} deposit {{in the area}} in which depth charges were dropped", absolving the responding blimps from any fault as their method of detecting submarines relies on a <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detector.</b> This also implied that Lt. Hubbard and his crew were operating the ship's sonar equipment incorrectly. After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast. Hubbard, however, never accepted that he had been mistaken about the [...] "battle." [...] Both he and Tom Moulton, one of his officers, claimed that the official denials of any Japanese submarine presence off the Pacific coast had been motivated by a desire to avoid panic among the U.S. population.

2500|$|In January 2008, Boeing {{proposed}} the P-8I, a customized export {{variant of the}} P-8A, for the Indian Navy. It features two major components not fitted on the P-8A, a Telephonics APS-143 OceanEye aft radar and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detector</b> (MAD). On 4 January 2009, India's Ministry of Defence signed a US$2.1billion agreement with Boeing for the supply of eight P-8Is to replace the Indian Navy's aging Tupolev Tu-142M maritime surveillance turboprops. India was the P-8's first international customer and was also Boeing's first military sale to India. [...] In October 2010, India's Defence Acquisition Council approved the purchase of four additional P-8Is; this purchase is reportedly under consideration as of 2014. In 2011, India planned to order 12 more P-8Is at a later date. In July 2016, it was confirmed India had ordered another four P-8Is that will be delivered by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>detectors</b> developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|R
5000|$|Undersea versus fleet {{action is}} {{commonly}} {{described as a}} [...] "cat-and-mouse" [...] game, where submarines seek to escape detection long enough {{to engage in a}} punishing strike against the much more valuable CV fleet groups. Early Soviet submarine designs could be heard [...] "across the Atlantic," [...] but by the late 80s, many advanced designs were approaching sound-output equivalent to a body of water the size of the sub. P-3 Orions or other ASW maritime patrol planes could deploy <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detectors</b> or disposable sonobuoys, against which the concept of a submarine firing a SAM was generally considered a poor trade-off (the revelation of the submarine's location was not generally considered worth the possible hit on a single plane). However, the concept of the submarine firing on the plane has been revived with Germany's 209-class diesel submarines.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMagnetic {{fields of}} naval vessels {{are widely used}} {{all over the world}} for {{detection}} and localization of naval vessel. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> <b>Detectors</b> (MADs) installed on air borne vehicles are used to detect submarine operating in shallow waters.
