25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear <b>multi-speed</b> arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. <b>multi-speed</b> bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in <b>multi-speed</b> bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
25|$|Some chainrings can be {{outfitted}} with a chain guard — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the chainring. Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. Chain guard is usually mounted on the outboard side of the chainring or, in case of multi-sprocket chainring, on the outboard side of the largest chainring. Single-sprocket chainrings may have chain guards on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on <b>multi-speed</b> juvenile bicycles.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a new type of solutions to a nonlinear Schrödinger system. These solutions, which we call "multi-speeds solitary waves", are behaving at large time as a couple of scalar solitary waves traveling at different speeds. The proof relies on the construction of approximations of the <b>multi-speeds</b> solitary waves by solving the system backwards in time and using energy methods to obtain uniform estimates...|$|R
5000|$|Obsolete chain designs {{previously}} used on bicycles {{included the}} block chain, the skip-link chain, and the Simpson lever chain. The first chains {{were of a}} simple, bushingless design. These had inherent reliability problems and a bit more friction (and mechanical efficiency losses) than modern chains. With these limitations in mind, the Nevoigt brothers, of the German Diamant Bicycle Company, designed the roller chain in 1898, which uses bushings, {{and it is the}} prevalent chain today. Whether it be singlespeed (for example with an internal-gears hub), fixed gear (such as track bikes and modern urban [...] "fixies") or <b>multi-speeds</b> with derailleurs, all modern chains in use today are of the [...] "roller chain" [...] design. Although it is still possible to order lower cost [...] "bushingless" [...] chains from China today, with generally lower manufacturing costs across the board, bushingless chains are generally considered undesirable and not prevalent.|$|R
25|$|Several EU member-states are in {{economic}} decline in both relative and absolute terms {{leading to a}} de facto <b>Multi-speed</b> Europe. Persistence of low economic growth and increased cost of living have affected the level of disposable incomes and domestic debt-to-savings ratios. Globalization has brought increased competition in both internal and export markets for companies based within the European Union. European Union growth stimulus policies - artificially created monetary expansion to combat deflationary pressures through credit & fiscal easing - is only postponing absolute economic decline and burdening future generations with humongous debt repayments {{in the absence of}} innovation-led growth.|$|E
25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears are {{appropriate}} for different people and styles of cycling. <b>Multi-speed</b> bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{attempts}} were made to introduce practical steam powered vehicles. Innovations such as hand brakes, <b>multi-speed</b> transmissions and better steering developed. Some commercially successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United Kingdom Locomotive Act (1865), which required many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively halted road auto development in the UK for {{most of the rest of}} the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.|$|E

2500|$|A cyclist's legs produce power optimally {{within a}} narrow {{pedalling}} speed range, or cadence. Gearing can be optimized {{to use this}} narrow range as efficiently as possible. As in other types of transmissions, the gear ratio {{is closely related to}} the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain of the bicycle. On single-speed bicycles and <b>multi-speed</b> bicycles using derailleur gears, the gear ratio depends on the ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring to the number of teeth on the rear sprocket (cog). [...] For bicycles equipped with hub gears, the gear ratio also depends on the internal planetary gears within the hub. For a shaft-driven bicycle the gear ratio depends on the bevel gears used {{at each end of the}} shaft.|$|E
2500|$|Wildwood is more soft fantasy than hard fantasy, in that {{historical}} and technological consistency and plausibility {{are not a}} high priority, giving the book a whimsical, or stream of consciousness, tone. The factions of The Wood {{use a variety of}} anachronistic technologies, including cutlasses, blunderbusses, and flintlocks, concurrent with howitzers and semi-automatic pistols, and vehicles like animal-drawn wagons and carts alongside bicycles, trucks and trains. No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could [...] "pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology" [...] they wanted, and Ellis said they [...] "just picked whatever we liked." [...] When she first meets the South Wood postman Richard, he threatens her with a shotgun, which in the same paragraph is referred to as a double-barrelled rifle, then on the next page it is called a shotgun again. Though the text pointedly mentions Prue's single-speed bicycle, the illustrations twice show her bike having derailleur gears, which are only present on <b>multi-speed</b> bikes.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded <b>multi-speed</b> freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] <b>Multi-speed</b> AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Multi-speed</b> Europe or {{two-speed}} Europe (called also [...] "variable geometry Europe" [...] or [...] "Core Europe" [...] {{depending on}} the form it would take in practice) {{is the idea that}} different parts of the European Union should integrate at different levels and pace {{depending on the}} political situation in each individual country.
