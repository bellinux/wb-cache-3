25|$|Increases in {{temperature}} when filling {{make it difficult}} to accurately decant or pump a <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver.|$|E
25|$|Their {{goal was}} to find {{experimental}} designs for investigating the dependence of some <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> {{on a number of}} independent variables (factors), each taking L levels, {{in such a way as}} to minimize the variance of the estimates of these dependencies using a limited number of experiments. Interactions between the factors were considered negligible. The solution to this problem is to find an experimental design where each combination of levels for any pair of factors appears the same number of times, throughout all the experimental runs (refer to table). A complete factorial design would satisfy this criterion, but the idea was to find smaller designs.|$|E

25|$|LC-MS {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} {{bioanalysis}} and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E

For this, micromagnetic <b>measuring</b> <b>quantities</b> derived from the magnetic Barkhausen noise are used. By heating up to temperature values above the Curie temperature of cementite, characteristic changes of the <b>measuring</b> <b>quantities</b> are shown. Cementite produces actively its own magnetic Barkhausen noise, whereas it also influences the magnetic Barkhausen noise of the iron matrix as a foreign body and by its stress fields of the second kind. Both influences act {{in a different way}} as well in steel as in white cast iron.

2500|$|Numbers {{are very}} often {{obtained}} {{as the result}} of a measurement. As measurements are generally afflicted with some measurement error with a known upper bound, the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with [...] digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolut measurement error is bounded from above by 10-n. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same real number, the numeral 0.080 is to suggest a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also significant figures).|$|E

2500|$|The particle-like {{behavior}} is most evident due to phenomena associated with measurement in quantum mechanics. Upon measuring {{the location of}} the particle, the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of the wave function will randomly [...] "collapse", or rather [...] "decohere", to a sharply peaked function at some location. For particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-defined position, (subject to uncertainty), a property traditionally associated with particles. It {{is important to note that}} a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and the <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> is forced into a particular eigenstate. The act of measurement is therefore not fundamentally different from any other interaction.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{advantages}} {{of using a}} Millikan-Lauritsen plot, and this form of correction procedure, rather than a Fowler-Nordheim plot and a slope correction factor, are seen to be the following. (1) The plotting procedure is marginally more straightforward. (2) The correction involves a physical parameter (V) that is a <b>measured</b> <b>quantity,</b> rather than a physical parameter (f) {{that has to be}} calculated [...] (3) Both the parameter κ itself, and the correction procedure, are more transparent (and more readily understood) than the Fowler-Nordheim-plot equivalents. (4) This procedure takes into account all physical effects that influence the value of κ, whereas the Fowler-Nordheim-plot correction procedure (in the form in which it has been carried out for the last 50 years) takes into account only those effects associated with barrier shape – assuming, furthermore, that this shape is that of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier. (5) There is a cleaner separation of theoretical and technological concerns: theoreticians will be interested in establishing what information any measured values of κ provide about CFE theory; but experimentalists can simply use measured values of κ to make more accurate estimates (if needed) of field enhancement factors.|$|E
