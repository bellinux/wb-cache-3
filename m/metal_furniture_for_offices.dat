40|$|The {{functional}} {{conditions on}} the ships lead to the variety of interior design on the ships, having influences on the construction, functionality and aesthetical shape of the furniture. They are as follows: limited and restraint space, functional role and destination of each room; multifunctional spaces; ships movement: rolling, rocking, variation of level, rotations and vibrations; environment issues: high relative air- humidity, salt medium, random meteorological conditions; multifunctional <b>furniture</b> (<b>for</b> resting, <b>office</b> purpose, lunch purpose, games and fun); diversity of materials of the ships structure and of the furniture on the ships. The paper presents the most important furniture structures, the adequate constructive presumed shapes (rounded corners and edge battens), materials, textures, colours, fittings and other. All these are useful for designers, engineers who build or up to date the ships. The paper shows {{the connection between the}} aspects related to furniture and the variation of the interior arrangements...|$|R
25|$|The building's most {{distinctive}} architectural {{feature is the}} fireplace, uncommon in office buildings, and the structure's only feature to incorporate Roman brick. The present-day structure consists of one open, interior space, while Wright's original design divided the building into two sections. One section was used as Smith's real estate office, the other as the bank. Wright also designed {{a full set of}} <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> both <b>offices,</b> although much of it has been sold over the years. One of the pieces of Wright-designed furniture in the building was a round-backed chair. The chair was at least the second attempt at a round-backed chair by Wright; an earlier, more successful attempt was completed in the Darwin D. Martin House. The chair has a bent-wood back, and rounded seat and stretchers. The total integration of the design is less successful than that used in the Martin House. Other interior features include a now electrically lit skylight, oak trim, and exposed stonework.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} how physical features of a natural setting influenced perceived coherence and three positive outcome variables: preference, pleasure, and (self-reported) restoration. Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of perceived coherence. One hundred thirty-one students evaluated three (virtual) natural environments: an environment with <b>metal</b> <b>furniture,</b> an environment with wooden furniture, and an environment without furniture. Results showed that <b>metal</b> <b>furniture</b> negatively influenced perceived coherence as well as preference, pleasure and restoration, compared to wooden furniture and no furniture. Perceived coherence of the environment with wooden furniture {{was significantly higher than}} the environment with <b>metal</b> <b>furniture,</b> but significantly lower than the environment without furniture. We did not find support that preference for, and experienced pleasure and restoration in the environment with wooden furniture differed from the environment without furniture. Perceived coherence mediated the effect of (<b>metal)</b> <b>furniture</b> on preference, pleasure, and restoration. Scientific and practical implications are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
