40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the infomax {{technique}} [1] for blind signal {{separation from the}} instantaneous <b>mixing</b> <b>case</b> to the convolutive <b>mixing</b> <b>case.</b> Separation in the convolutive case requires an unmix-ing system which uses present and past values of the observation vector, when the mixing system is causal. Thus, in developing an infomax process, both temporal and spatial dependence of the ob-servations must be considered. We propose a stochastic gradient based structure which accomplishes this task. Performance of the proposed method is verified by subjective listening tests and quan-titative measurements. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{can observe}} {{the process of}} {{determining}} the competence of military courts in Poland {{in the second half}} of the 16 th century. They were competent to decide in all cases in which at least one of the parties was a military man. There were problems with these courts, so Polish noblemen decided to establish new courts for cases in which one party was a soldier and second was civilian (<b>mixed</b> <b>cases).</b> This reforms have been implemented since 1567 and from this time the civil courts could also decide in such cases. Another important aspect is connected with strict liability of commanders for their soldiers. Polish noblemen didn’t want to accept the commanders’ jurisdiction in <b>mixed</b> <b>cases.</b> After 1578, when the supreme Crown Tribunal (Trybunał Koronny) was established, they struggled for giving the competence to this civil court in <b>mixed</b> <b>cases.</b> They succeed in 1593, although even after this date there were political disputes about the competence of civil jurisdiction...|$|R
25|$|Ancient Greek was firstly {{written in}} Linear B, but {{afterwards}} {{it was written}} in the Greek alphabet, with some variation among dialects.

25|$|The Heavy and Medium typefaces were {{designed}} {{to compensate for the}} optical illusion that makes dark lines on pale backgrounds appear narrower than pale lines on dark backgrounds. Hence destinations are written in <b>mixed</b> <b>case</b> white Transport Medium on green and blue backgrounds, and in black Transport Heavy on white backgrounds. Route numbers are coloured yellow when placed directly on a green background. Some signs logically show the closest destination on the route first (i.e., on top), while others show the most distant settlement first. On a roundabout DS, the route locations are usually listed with the closest destination at the bottom and the furthest away at the top when going straight ahead, and likewise going left and right. However, many left-right signs more logically indicate the closest destination at the top with further afield destinations listed in descending order.|$|E

The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.|$|E
40|$|Oligonucleotide probes {{specific}} to the characteristic repeat sequences of two alleles of the circumsporozoite protein gene of Plasmodium vivax(VK 210 and VK 247) were selected, synthe-sized, and tested on matched blood and sporozoite DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction from 182 cases naturally acquired in Thailand. Probe results were compared to those of circum-sporozoite phenotype-specific ELISAs used to evaluate sporozoites from the same cases.

Although {{there was also a}} nearly complete agreement between probe and ELISA results for cases producing only VK 210 or VK 247 sporozoites, the probes detected 45 % more mixed infections than did the ELISAs when used to test specimens from western and southern Thailand; there was no discrepancy when <b>mixed</b> <b>cases</b> from Cambodia were tested.

[...] The Transport Heavy and Motorway typefaces are used, although the Irish language text uses a distinctive oblique variant, in which letters a are represented by script a (ɑ), and letters i are represented by dotless i (ı) in order better to differentiate them from their accented forms (However, sometimes normal letter i is used). Only the Irish place name is shown if the sign is in the Gaeltacht, or the official name in English {{is identical to the}} Irish name or nearly so (for example Dún Laoghaire or Port Laoise).

2500|$|The full {{strength}} associated with using the entire ASCII character set (numerals, <b>mixed</b> <b>case</b> letters and special characters) is only achieved if each possible password is equally likely. [...] This {{seems to suggest}} that all passwords must contain characters from each of several character classes, perhaps upper and lower case letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. [...] In fact, such a requirement is a pattern in password choice and can be expected to reduce an attacker's [...] "work factor" [...] (in Claude Shannon's terms). [...] This is a reduction in password [...] "strength". [...] A better requirement would be to require a password NOT to contain any word in an online dictionary, or list of names, or any license plate pattern from any state (in the US) or country (as in the EU). If patterned choices are required, humans are likely to use them in predictable ways, such a capitalizing a letter, adding one or two numbers, and a special character. This predictability means that the increase in password strength is minor when compared to random passwords.|$|E

The critical finding is that the N 170 amplitude was sensitive to <b>case</b> <b>mixing,</b> but the P 3 amplitude was sensitive to word frequency and lexicality.
