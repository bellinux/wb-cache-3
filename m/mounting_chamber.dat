5000|$|This is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used measurement system for measuring water supply in houses. The fluid, most commonly water, enters in one side of the meter and strikes the nutating disk, which is eccentrically mounted. The disk must then [...] "wobble" [...] or nutate about the vertical axis, since the bottom and the top of the disk remain in contact with the <b>mounting</b> <b>chamber.</b> A partition separates the inlet and outlet chambers. As the disk nutates, it gives direct indication of the volume of the liquid that has passed through the meter as volumetric flow is indicated by a gearing and register arrangement, which is connected to the disk. It is reliable for flow measurements within 1 percent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Vibration causes {{mechanical}} distortions in fiber-optic {{transmission lines}} that induce time (phase) fluctuations. RF systems are increasingly using optical fibers {{in various ways}} and must occasionally operate in environments with acoustic and structure-born vibration. A scheme is described which enables electronic suppression and cancellation of vibration-induced spurious phase noise in an optical fiber wound on a spool. The scheme is applied to an opto-electronic oscillator (OEO). Close-to-carrier spectral lines often occur due to mechanical vibration of state-of-the-art oscillators. Passive vibration-suppression schemes (shock <b>mounts,</b> isolation <b>chambers,</b> etc.) do not always adequately reduce discrete line spectra that originate from vibration effects. However, vibration can be readily detected and measured by use of accelerometers. One can correct for these low-frequenc...|$|R
40|$|Least action {{principle}} (LAP) in rivers {{is demonstrated}} by maximum flow efficiency (MFE) and {{is the foundation of}} variational mechanics based on energy and work rather than Newtonian force and momentum. Empirical evidence shows it to be the primary control for the adjustment of alluvial channels. Because most rivers flow with imposed water and sediment loads down valley gradients they have largely inherited, they self-regulate energy expenditure to match the work they are required to do to remain stable. Overpowered systems develop a variety of channel patterns to expend excess energy and remain stable. Australia offers an opportunity to study low-energy rivers closely adjusted to very low continental gradients. The anabranching Marshall and single-thread Plenty Rivers flow down nearly straight channels with average H numbers [ratio between excess bed shear and width/depth (W/D) ratio] close to the optimum of 0. 3 for stationary equilibrium. Ridge-form divisions of the original channel width create anabranches that radically alter W/D ratios relative to bed shear, the same being true for short-wide islands on the large low-gradient Yangtze River in China. In contrast, <b>Mount</b> <b>Chambers</b> Creek in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s tectonically more active Flinders Ranges is accreting an alluvial fan with unstable distributary channels exhibiting H numbers well below the optimum. LAP also explains profound biases in Earth 2 ̆ 7 s stratigraphic record. Because meandering is an energy-shedding mechanism, sinuous rivers sequester relatively little sediment resulting in all sequences being just a few tens of metres thick. In contrast, low-energy braided disequilibrium systems can sequester sediment piles over a kilometre in thickness and tens of kilometres wide. LAP provides a new paradigm for river research by identifying the attractor state controlling river channel evolution. It links advances in theoretical physics to fluvial geomorphology, stratigraphy and hydraulic engineering and opens opportunities for diverse investigations in Earth system science...|$|R

40|$|Abdominal frog skin, {{mounted on}} an Ussing chamber, {{actively}} transports sodium {{from the outer}} or pond side of the epithelium to the serosal side. The outermost layer of the skin is composed of cornified cells and does not participate in active transport. Pondside sodium enters through the first living layer of cells, the stratum granulosum. Electron microprobe studies demonstrated that the stratum granulosum and the more basal strata were in the route of sodium active transport. Previously we have shown, using frog skin processed immediately after euthanasia, that the stratum granulosum had significantly fewer gap junctions per unit length of membrane than the other strata. In this study we examined a time series of frog skins, from zero min to four h. Using an electron microscopic counting technique, we then determined the number of gap junctions and desmosomes in each stratum. The density of gap junctions (number/micrometer of membrane) in the stratum granulosum rose from 0. 04 /µm to 0. 13 /µm 30 min after <b>chamber</b> <b>mounting.</b> During this period, the density of gap junctions in the other strata was nearly constant.

40|$|Abstract: Background. The {{excessive}} {{accumulation of}} cholesterol absorbed from bile by the gallbladder impairs its contractility and favours gallstone formation. The fetal low plasma and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations {{are associated with}} gallstone disease. Aims, To investigate the effect of plasma lipoproteins on gallbladder cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine absorption from bile and to establish whether cholesterol absorption is Brefeldin A-sensitive Methods. Gallbladder mucosa lipid absorption rates were measured using: 1) in vitro isolated intra-arterially perfused pig gallbladder model with and without plasma lipoproteins perfusing the vascular tree; 2) human gallbladder fragments <b>mounted</b> in Ussing <b>chambers</b> with plasma lipoproteins at different concentrations in the serosal side; 3) pig gallbladder fragments <b>mounted</b> in Ussing <b>chambers</b> in the presence and absence of Brefeldin A. Results. Total lipoproteins and high density lipoprotein significantly increased the release of biliary cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine in plasma and significantly decreased the tissue accumulation of cholesterol absorbed from bile. The scavenger effect of plasma lipoproteins on cholesterol absorbed from bile was concentration dependent Brefeldin A did not influence gallbladder absorption of biliary cholesterol. Conclusions, Biliary cholesterol is absorbed by gallbladder mucosa via a Brefeldin-insensitive pathway and is removed by plasma lipoproteins...|$|R
