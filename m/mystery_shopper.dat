25|$|In 2005, the {{business}} introduced a 'Mystery Shopper' programme to score its branches {{on the service}} they provide. The <b>mystery</b> <b>shopper</b> grades the branch on its presentation and on the service the branch provides at its service counters, checkouts, wine department and shop floor. In more recent times however, the unpopular <b>mystery</b> <b>shopper</b> programme is being phased out in favour of a customer feedback system called 'Measuring the Magic'. Customers are given a card which directs them to the Waitrose Experience website. In return for grading various areas of their shopping experience, customers are entered into a monthly £500 prize draw. The new system hopes to give feedback tailored to each instance of customer-partner contact, instead of being based on strict criteria.|$|E

50|$|Matched pair {{testing is}} used to detect discrimination. The focus is to {{determine}} the presence of disparate treatment in the offering of goods and services during the sales process. Traditionally used to determine discrimination in housing and mortgage lending, the research methodology involves the use of pairs of testers or <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers,</b> representing test and control cells. Control cells usually comprise non-protected classes of consumers and test cells comprise protected classes of consumers under the Fair Housing Act. For example, control cells comprise non-minority or male <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> while test cells comprise African American or Hispanic or female <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers.</b> The <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> in each pair (e.g., African American and White) conduct the tests separately but each is provided with profiles that are matched or very similar. The profiles typically contain financial, demographic and classification characteristics (gender and age) of the shopper. The shoppers in each pair perform the same inquiry and ask for the same information. The only difference is the test treatment, for example, the ethnicity or gender of the <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers.</b> Prior to conducting the mystery shop, the <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> are trained on how to conduct the mystery shops, the use of the profile and how to record information pertaining to the treatment and information they will receive. After completing the <b>mystery</b> shop, the <b>shoppers</b> record the experience encountered and the information received on a questionnaire. The information entered on the questionnaires is entered into an electronic data base and the experiences of test and control <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> are compared.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine what mystery {{shopping}} is, why it is used and how mystery customers are trained and how the information collected is fed back to the client organisation. Design/methodology/approach – The approach was to use an online survey of <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> compares the reality of the situation with the best practice identified from the extant literature. Findings – The main outcome was that results identify good and bad practices in all areas of the process and guidelines for the recruitment, training and monitoring of <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> are proposed including in-depth training in all aspects of the job. Research limitations/implications – A sample of 85 <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> was used and only in the UK. It would be interesting to widen this out internationally. Practical implications – <b>Mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> are used worldwide by services to evaluate the performance of their front-line people and processes but are their evaluations valid and reliable? This research identifies good and bad practice which should help managers to design their training for <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: To prevent alcohol {{availability}} through retail, {{legal age}} limits forbid {{the sale of}} alcohol to minors in many countries. This study tested the effects of minors’ alcohol-purchasing strategies and knowledge of compliance with age-limit legislation {{on the availability of}} alcohol through retail in the Netherlands. Methods: Making use of exploratory, field-experimental design, eight 17 -year-old minors participated as <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> over the period of one weekend. The <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> were allowed to use their own strategies to buy alcohol. The experiences of the first group were shared with the second group. Results: Out of the 134 times, the shoppers entered an outlet to buy alcohol, and 119 attempts were successful (11. 2 % compliance). A total quantity of 225. 78 US gallons of alcohol-containing beverages was bought. The first group bought 53. 93 L on their final day, and the second group bought 53. 92 L on their first day, making use of the strategies of the first group. Conclusions: Current self-checkout lanes in supermarkets produce extreme alcohol availability and are even less effective than traditional checkout lanes: Policies for age verification fail.

Methods: Data were collected using the method of mystery shopping. Three teams, each consisting of two 15 -year-old <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers,</b> conducted 105 alcohol purchase attempts in supermarkets in three regions in the Netherlands. Results: A compliance rate of 24. 8 % was found, which is a significant improvement compared with Dutch basement compliance rate from the past (14. 9 %), but is nominally still very low. Conclusions: This mass media intervention campaign failed to increase compliance to an acceptable level. Also the specific goal of the campaign (ask everybody under < 20 years old for identification [ID]) failed because fewer than half of the 15 -year-old <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> in the study were asked to show their ID when purchasing alcoholic beverages...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Because minors {{generally}} {{report higher}} accessibility than {{one would expect}} {{on the basis of}} the "compliance rates" established by researchers (the percentage of stores that comply with age limits for sales of age-restricted products such as alcoholic beverages), we propose a new method to better depict the availability of age-restricted products for minors as an alternative to the compliance approach, which in our view is too narrow. Method: Underage <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> were assigned to buy alcohol in a store of their preference, using any (legally allowed) purchase method. The time required to buy alcohol was the main outcome variable. As a benchmark, the time required to buy soft drinks was recorded. Results: All underage <b>mystery</b> <b>shoppers</b> succeeded in buying alcohol, which means 100 % availability. On average, buying alcohol took less than 10 minutes (including travel and shopping time), which was 2 minutes more than when purchasing soft drinks. Conclusions: Compliance at an outlet level can misrepresent the actual availability to minors. Both the proposed approach to availability and a new approach to age validation indicate that the general assumption that the traditional methods of age validation can effectively prevent the commercial availability of age-restricted products to minors should be seriously questione...|$|R
