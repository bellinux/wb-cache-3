500|$|In 2010, Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the album}} Travieso Carmesí, a musical project created to celebrate the Bicentennial of Mexico. Lafourcade analyzed Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara's catalogue and decided to record a tribute album with his songs, since the singer wanted to give herself the opportunity to perform songs written by another person. In 2014, Lafourcade {{wanted to find a}} balance between heart, mind and body, and traveled to Veracruz, Colombia and Cuba, searching for inspiration to write new music. [...] "This [...] album was made parallel to the experience of singing the Lara's music... is the result of <b>my</b> <b>need</b> to be proud of my songs." [...] Lafourcade said to Vívelo Hoy. The album Hasta la Raíz is Lafourcade's sixth studio album and is her first album of original material in six years, since Hu Hu Hu (2009) and was produced by Argentinean musician Cachorro López, Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel García and herself after another record producer became very expensive. The album version of the track was released as a digital download on January 14, 2015 and a new version entitled [...] "Canova's Root Version" [...] was available on May 19, 2015. Lafourcade included the song on the live EP Spotify Sessions. [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] is featured in the Italian edition of the album series Now Summer Hits 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Tynan's second {{marriage}} began falling apart, {{largely because of}} [...] "Tynan's insistence on total sexual latitude for himself, fidelity for his wife". He formed {{a relationship with a}} woman to enact sado-masochistic fantasies, sometimes involving both of them cross-dressing, sometimes hiring prostitutes as [...] "extras" [...] in elaborate scenes. Tynan told his wife that he intended to continue with the sessions weekly [...] "although all common sense and reason and kindness and even camaraderie are against it. ... It is my choice, my thing, <b>my</b> <b>need</b> ... It is fairly comic and slightly nasty. But it is shaking me like an infection and I cannot do anything but be shaken until the fit has passed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles [...] "Wag" [...] Bennett, one of {{the judges}} at the 1966 competition, was {{impressed}} with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially <b>my</b> <b>need</b> to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.” ...|$|E
