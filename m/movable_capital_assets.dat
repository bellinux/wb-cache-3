40|$|Although {{some efforts}} have been made over the last 20 years, {{governmental}} <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> are still the subject of many unresolved questions. After presenting {{an overview of the}} current differing accounting standards or research efforts with respect to governmental <b>capital</b> <b>assets,</b> this paper analyses the criteria of recognition, valuation and disclosure of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in the reform of three kinds of Flemish governments. Their reformed accounting system is compared with IPSAS 17 (IFAC), being an important internationally driven milestone considering <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> An important issue is the lack of a conceptual framework regarding <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> and an attempt is made to canalise the existing ideas. An important issue in governmental accounting is the first balance sheet approach when accounting reforms are implemented. This study indicates that the lack of distinguishing a separate accounting framework for <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> with respect to the first balance sheet, causes a lot of confusion in the discussion about accounting standards. Finally, the paper aims at providing experiences in analysing governmental accounting standards for <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> The examination of the adoption reveals that the accounting reforms usually do {{not take into account the}} specific governmental characteristics of <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> governmental accounting, <b>capital</b> <b>assets,</b> governmental assets, accounting reform, accounting framework...|$|R

40|$|Property rights {{reform is}} {{typically}} hypothesized to boost investment through investment demand and credit supply effects. Yet when the credit supply effect is muted, property rights reform {{would be expected}} to induce liquidity-constrained farms to reduce investment in <b>movable</b> <b>capital</b> even as they increase investment in attached capital. This expectation is corroborated by econometric analysis of panel data from Paraguay. While all farmers experience a positive investment demand effect, liquidity-constrained producers correspondingly reduce their demand for <b>movable</b> <b>capital.</b> Given an estimated pattern of wealth-biased liquidity constraints, property rights reform will get institutions “right” for only wealthier producers.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityThe Catholic Church in Kenya {{is one of the}} large institutions holding immense wealth in terms of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in Kenya. The Catholic Church has however been faced with a challenge of managing these huge assets in order to realize optimal returns on such assets. This study sought to analyze the determinants of return on the <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Catholic Church in Kenya. The study was guided by four objectives which were; to explore effect of the Catholic Church’s leadership philosophy on optimized returns on <b>Capital</b> <b>assets,</b> to determine the effect of organizational factors on returns of <b>Capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Catholic Church in Kenya, to determine the effect of environmental factors on returns of <b>Capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Catholic Church in Kenya and to determine the critical success factors that affects the rate of return of <b>Capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by Catholic Church in Kenya. The study was based on a descriptive research design. A census approach was used where the target was to cover all the 26 dioceses in Kenya. The study findings were that on leadership philosophy, future oriented and value oriented approaches to asset management were the most prominent leadership factors affecting return on assets at a coefficient of 0. 48 and 0. 11 reflecting 48 % and 11 % respectively. For organizational factors the most prominent factors were the criteria and process for monitoring growth and investment issues in the environment affecting return on assets at a level of 60 % followed by the roles and responsibilities of those vested with powers to make decisions at a level of 20 %. For environmental factors the two environmental factors that determined the return on <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> are the amount and the effect of management and administrative fees explaining 62 % level of influence and the transaction costs and custodial fees benchmarks required to maintain a <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> explaining 11 % level of influence on return on <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Catholic Church. The study concluded that the impact of leadership philosophy, organizational factors and environmental factors on return on <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> is real and practical as established by this study. The study therefore recommended more focus on leadership practices that enhance optimized return on <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> The study recommended a mixed leadership model where both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be adopted in order to realize optimized return on <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> for the <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Catholic Church...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sets out}} to address the {{question}} of whether the costs and the benefits of measuring intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> differ depending on the driver for that measure. Although pressure is growing on firms to measure and report on their intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> no research has yet been published that questions the costs associated with such actions. And although academic research has purported to show links between the management of intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> and real business benefits the research carried out thus far'has not focussed specifically on the benefits of measuring intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> Although there are now a variety of intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> measurement frameworks there has been no cross comparison as to which intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> measures provide the most business insight or where the outcome of that measurement is most effective. Using a multi method approach the thesis is tested in three phases; an extensive literature review covering intellectual capital, performance measurement and organisational effectiveness; a survey and content analysis to explore what and why companies measure; and structured interviewing of six companies to investigate the costs and the benefits of measurement. The thesis is tested through the investigation of thirteen propositions which show that: firstly, there is a difference in the relative cost of measuring intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> given the measurement driver, which is explained by the frequency of measurement, the mode of data collection and analysis, and whether the use of the measure is a by product of some other driver, secondly, that the insight provided by an intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> measure differs given the measurement driver, thirdly, that the measurement of intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> is most effective for planning the future; and lastly, that particular measurement drivers are effective, to differing degrees, in financial, customer, operational, people and future organisational performance domains.

40|$|This paper investigates {{explanations}} {{of variation in}} the development of <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> volume between Swedish local governments, 1999 – 2008. As a pre-study, four cases were performed, generating 7 suggested explanatory factors. Hypotheses were generated by combining the suggested factors with a new political economy framework, containing two general assumptions. A national dataset of Swedish local governments were used in a multiple linear regression analysis. The regression model indicates that four significant explanatory factors explain 42 per cent of the variation. An increasing <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> volume could be explained by population growth, a high <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> volume per capita {{at the beginning of the}} period, high solidity at the beginning of the period and an increasing level of tariffs. A decreasing <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> volume could be explained in the opposite way. From a new political economy perspective, the major finding is that politicians tend to adjust the service capacity of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> to the given population size of the municipality. They tend to use all available resources for their capital investment activities to maintain or improve the services provided by the <b>capital</b> <b>assets,</b> as long as it complies with sustainable economic conditions...|$|R
