30|$|The nominal {{heating cycle}} is {{designed}} {{so as to}} apply a constant temperature of 438  K (330  F) on both top and bottom mold walls. The press closure is initially based on a constant closure rate of 0.1524 mm/min (6 mils/min). As the cure reaction advances, the viscosity increases and so the closing force to be applied by the press increases. When the maximum closing force of the press is attained, the control switches to a force-based one. The closure rate is therefore adapted so as to keep the closing force constant. A final technological restriction {{to be taken into}} account is the so-called hard-stop condition, occurring when the cumulated displacement reaches its <b>maximum</b> <b>value,</b> 3.3 <b>mm</b> (130 mils).|$|R

Lack of information in the veterinary literature directed the focus of this report to normal aspects of the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes of adult dogs on CT imaging. A CT scan of 15 normal adult male and female Rottweilers was done. To define them as clinically sound, anamnesis, physical examination, complete blood count, renal and hepatic biochemistry, ECG, and thoracic radiographs were performed. After the intravenous injection of hydrosoluble ionic iodine contrast medium contiguous 10 mm in thickness thoracic transverse images were obtained with an axial scanner. In the obtained images mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes were sought and when found measured in their smallest diameter and their attenuation was compared to musculature. Mean and standard deviation of: age, weight, body length and the smallest diameter of the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes were determined. Mean and standard deviation of parameters: age 3. 87 ± 2. 03 years, weight 41. 13 ± 5. 12, and body length 89. 61 ± 2. 63 cm. Axillary lymph nodes were seen in 60 % of the animals, mean of the smallest diameter was 3. 58 mm {{with a standard deviation of}} 2. 02 and a minimum <b>value</b> of 1 <b>mm</b> and a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of 7 <b>mm.</b> From 13 observed lymph nodes 61. 53 % were hypopodense when compared with musculature, and 30. 77 % were isodense. Mediastinal lymph nodes were identified in 73. 33 % of the dogs; mean measure of the smallest diameter was 4. 71 mm with a standard deviation of 2. 61 mm and a minimum <b>value</b> of 1 <b>mm,</b> and a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of 8 <b>mm.</b> From 14 observed lymph nodes 85. 71 % were isodense when compared with musculature and 14. 28 % were hypodense.

40|$|AbstractParticle image {{velocimetry}} (PIV) is {{utilized to}} measure the non-reacting flow field in a reflow combustor with multiple and single swirlers. The velocity field, vortex structure and total vorticity levels are experimentally obtained using two different boundary conditions, representing a single confined swirler and multiple swirlers in an annular combustor. The influence of the boundary conditions on the flow field at several locations downstream of the swirlers is experimentally investigated, showing that the central vortex in the multi-swirler case is more concentrated than in the single-swirler case. The vorticity of the central vortex and average cross-sectional vorticity are relatively low at the swirler outlet in both cases. Both of these statistics gradually increase to the <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> near 20 <b>mm</b> downstream of the swirler outlet, and subsequently decrease. It is {{also found that the}} central vortex in the multi-swirler case is consistently greater than the single-swirler case.

40|$|The Historical 1 {{simulation}} (1960 - 2000) and the RCP 8. 5 scenario (2060 - 2100) {{from the}} NorESM {{are used to}} investigate trends in extreme precipitation, {{as well as the}} impact from vertical velocity, specific humidity, divergence and temperature on the precipitation formation. The calculations are performed over the Indian catchments Godavari and Krishna, and are restricted to the monsoon season (June-September). Precipitation from the APHRODITE observations are used to validate the NorESM precipitation, and the vertical velocity, specific humidity, divergence and temperature are validated against the NCEP 1 reanalysis. The calculated trends in extreme precipitation show that both the yearly mean intensity and the yearly number of events will increase in the future, by approximately 30 % and 40 % (90 % over Krishna), respectively. Using linear regression analysis, the vertical velocity is found {{to be the most important}} factor in the formation of extreme precipitation with a correlation of 0. 66 over Godavari and 0. 47 over Krishna. Along with the specific humidity, most of the precipitation amounts can be accounted for by only including these two parameters, while the temperature is assumed to be less important. A simple model is also applied to estimate precipitation under the assumption that an air parcel follows the moist adiabatic lapse rate. This estimated precipitation is underestimated, and the extreme precipitation has its <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> 20 <b>mm</b> below the NorESM extreme values. This shows the importance of including diabatic terms such as radiative cooling, which increases the condensation rate of an air parcel...|$|R

In this article, these parametrs have been simulated with a coupled atmosphere-snow regional climate model for {{the southern part of}} Greenland during the summer of 1991 forced at the lateral boundaries with ECMWF re-analysis. The calculated (from net ablation, i. e. ablation without refreezing) snow and ice positive degree-day factors vary considerably over the ice sheet. At low elevations, the modelled snow degree-day factor approaches closely the generally accepted <b>value</b> of 3 <b>mm</b> WE d- 1 °C- 1.

40|$|The Earth {{is rapidly}} {{changing}} in both its climate and its land distribution. The numerous methods {{from the literature}} show various possibilities to assess the crop evapotranspiration and evaporation rate, both with direct measurements and empirical formulas. The present paper brings forward a methodology that demonstrates how to compute the potential land cover evapotranspiration (ET c) at regional scale using climate data from 13 meteorological stations, empirical equations, Corine Land Cover data, and the Geographical Information System (GIS). Based on Thornthwaite method and evapotranspiration coefficients, the study assesses the ET c of Emilia-Romagna region in four stages. Moreover, the Budyko approach was applied to calculate the actual evapotraspiration (AET 0) and actual land cover evapotranspiration (AET c) to identify the critical areas of water deficit. Po Plain represents an area with high evapotranspiration rate, due to temperatures and cultivation patterns. A value of 778. 87 mm/year at Ferrara station was calculated for the potential evapotranspiration (ET 0), while the ET c ranging to 800 - 1000 mm/year in the central and northeastern part of the region.

40|$|Many {{field studies}} have shown that surface {{sublimation}} and blowing snow transport and sublimation have significant influences on the snow mass budget in many high latitude regions. We developed a coupled triple-moment blowing snow-atmospheric modeling system to study the influence of these processes on a seasonal time scale over the Northern Hemisphere. Two simulations were performed. The first is a 5 month simulation for comparison with snow survey measurements over a Saskatchewan site to validate the modeling system. The second simulation covers the 2006 / 2007 winter period to study the snow mass budget over the Northern Hemisphere. The results show that surface sublimation is significant in Eurasian Continent and the eastern region of North America, reaching a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of 200 <b>mm</b> SWE (Snow Water Equivalent). Over the Arctic Ocean and Northern Canada, surface deposition with an average <b>value</b> of 30 <b>mm</b> SWE was simulated. Blowing snow sublimation was found to return up to 50 mm SWE back to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while the divergence of blowing snow transport contributes only a few mm SWE to the change in snow mass budget. The results were further stratified in 10 degree latitudinal bands. The results show that surface sublimation decreases with an increase in latitude while blowing snow sublimation increases with latitude. Taken together, the surface sublimation and blowing snow processes was found to distribute 23 % to 52 % of winter precipitation over the three month winter season...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) densitometries of maxillary sinuses augmented with human bone allograft. In addition, previously obtained microradiographic specimens were used to verify the diagnostic potential of CBCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-stage protocol was conducted in 21 consecutive patients, all with a crestal bone height < 2 mm. Mineralized human bone allograft particles were used to augment sinuses using a lateral window approach. A succession of CBCT scans of the maxilla were taken before surgery, immediately after sinus augmentation, and 6, 10, and 18 months after implant placement. Using virtual probes, CBCT images taken at 6, 8, and 10 mm from the crestal surface were processed with medical imaging software and expressed as gray level (GL). RESULTS: A total of 24 sinus augmentation procedures were performed in 21 patients. The average values of CBCT-GL ranged from 571 to 654, presenting the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> at 8 <b>mm</b> immediately after implant placement and the minimum <b>value</b> at 6 <b>mm</b> after 10 months. Furthermore, it was found that the graft mineral content decreased over time, completely disappearing between 10 and 11 months. CONCLUSION: CBCT and the medical imaging software employed for imaging visualization are reliable tools to study biomaterial behavior after sinus augmentation procedures. In addition, results from this study demonstrate that a complete resorption of human bone allograft is possible. Due to the limited sample size, further clinical and morphometric studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|The free ion {{concentrations}} of Na+, K+ and Cl- have been {{measured in the}} cells and intercellular spaces of developing amphibian embryos using ion-sensitive microelectrodes. Ca 2 +, H+ and buffering capacity have also been measured in the intercellular spaces. The free intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations in the early cleavage stages remain approximately constant at 21 mM and 90 mM respectively. The free intracellular Cl- concentration, approximately 60 mM during the egg to 4 -cell stage, falls during development to around 30 mM by the 128 -cell stage. Embryos from different batches show a wide variation in intracellular free ion content. A strong correlation was observed between the ion content, particularly of K+, and {{the viability of the}} embryo. If the intracellular K+ concentration was less than 60 mM, embryos invariably died between late blastula and early gastrula stages; if greater than 80 mM the embryo generally survived. The intercellular free Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca 2 + concentrations in Xenopus mid-blastula embryos are 91 mM, 4 mM, 59 mM and 1. 5 mM respectively. The intercellular potential at late neurula stages is + 3. 5 mV when the embryo is bathed in 5 % Ringer solution; changing to Ringer solution reduced the potential to - 4 mV. Before gastrulation the intercellular Ca 2 + concentration in Xenopus falls to approximately 0. 5 mM, where it remains throughout gastrulation before returning to its mid-blastula value during neurulation. In Xenopus, the intercellular Na+ concentration falls to around 75 mM and the intercellular K+ concentration rises to around 17 mM at the end of gastrulation. These changes are not maintained and both Na+ and K+ concentrations return to their earlier values. In Ambystoma, the intercellular K+ concentration falls steadily from 7 mM at the mid-blastula stage to 2 mM at the end of neurulation. The Na+ concentration is constant at approximately 93 mM up to stage 14; between stages 14 and 16 the measurements show some scatter (minimum <b>value</b> 60 <b>mM,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> 100 <b>mM),</b> and beyond stage 16 the Na+ concentration increases to 123 mM...|$|R

The Ce-Cu-Al alloys with Zn addition also have high glass formation ability (GFA) and large supercooled liquid regions (Tx, Tx Tx Tg, Tx is the onset crystallization temperature and Tg is the glass transition temperature). The Tg, Tx and Tx are, respectively, 368, 437 and 69 K for the (Ce 0 : 72 Cu 0 : 28) 87 : 5 Al 10 Zn 2 : 5 alloy, and 394, 467 and 73 K for the (Ce 0 : 72 Cu 0 : 28) 82 : 5 -Al 10 Zn 7 : 5 alloy. The Tx of the (Ce 0 : 72 Cu 0 : 28) 100 xAl 10 Znx alloys was above 70 K and the BMGs with diameters up to 6 mm could be produced successfully.

In order to assess the yearly mass balance of the Mandrone Glacier the PDSLIM energy-balance model was applied: it is a seasonal snow-pack model, adapted to glaciers and based on a distributed physically-based two-layer snow and ice scheme. In this paper the investigated area, the model and the hydrometeorological data used in input to the model and for its verification are described. On a large scale, {{the accuracy of the}} model in simulating the retreat of the snow covered areas during the melt season is verified through comparison with remote images, resulting in a 86 % correspondence of observed snow-covered pixels. Downstream runoff measurements at the outlet of the Sarca di Genova basin at the Ponte Maria station were used as a term of comparison of the simulated summer melt. Runoff volumes measured over a twelve year period (1995 - 2006) were used to validate the simulation of the glacier’s melt, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0. 83.
