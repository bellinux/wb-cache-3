500|$|Cournot, a {{professor}} of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for duopoly—a <b>market</b> <b>condition</b> defined by competition between two sellers. [...] This treatment of competition, first published in Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, {{is referred to as}} Cournot duopoly. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost. [...] Further, it assumed that both goods were homogeneous. [...] Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied. [...] The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit Market price. [...] Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits. Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the marginalists. [...] Cournot's models of duopoly and Oligopoly also represent one of the first formulations of non-cooperative games. [...] Today the solution can be given as a Nash equilibrium but Cournot's work preceded modern game theory by over 100 years.|$|E

30|$|Traditionally, {{a variety}} of studies have relied on {{regional}} correlations between immigration rates and labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> {{to learn about the}} role of the latter in attracting immigrant flows. However, this “area approach” strategy has come under criticism, notably by Borjas et al. (1996), Borjas (2001), Card (2001) and more recently Borjas (2003) on two counts. First, labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> in a particular region could be affected by native inflows and outflows regardless of immigrant flows. If so, how can we measure the impact of labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> on the supply of immigrants relative to natives when labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> themselves are a by-product of native migration flows? Second, cross-sectional analyses may fail to account for demand shocks affecting local labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> and, as such, incite an erroneous interpretation of the correlation coefficients between immigrant flows and labor <b>market</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main {{objectives}} for this report. The {{first is to}} ascertain to what degree {{the unemployment rate is}} an adequate predictor of labour <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> {{in the context of the}} changing economy. Labour <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> refer to the state of the labour market and encompass different dimensions. The second is to assess the suitability of other labour market indicators as predictors of labour <b>market</b> <b>conditions.</b> The third is to discuss the feasibility of aggregating relevant labour market indicators into a composite indicator of labour <b>market</b> <b>conditions</b> that might be considered for use in the design of government programs. This report concludes that the unemployment rate is actually a good indicator of labour <b>market</b> <b>conditions,</b> although it is wise to supplement it with additional indicators.
