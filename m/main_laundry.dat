2500|$|Harmony {{lives on}} in name at Twin Oaks Community, a {{contemporary}} intentional community of 100 people in Virginia. Twin Oaks names all of its buildings after defunct communities, and [...] "Harmony" [...] {{is the name of}} one of the residences which also houses the community woodshop and <b>main</b> <b>laundry</b> area.|$|E
50|$|As the war progressed, German and Italian {{prisoners of}} war (the latter {{organized}} into Italian Service Units) were quartered at Camp Cooke. Both groups were kept separate {{from each other in}} accordance with the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, and worked on the post at various jobs including mechanical and civil engineering services, clerical positions, food service, and the <b>main</b> <b>laundry.</b> To help relieve the severe labor shortage in the commercial market created by wartime exigencies, the Germans also worked in local communities - mostly in agricultural jobs.|$|E
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of fire aboard Ecstasy was the unauthorized welding by crew members in the <b>main</b> <b>laundry</b> that ignited a large accumulation of lint in the ventilation system {{and the failure of}} Carnival Cruise Lines to maintain the laundry exhaust ducts in a fire-safe condition. Contributing to the extensive fire damage on the ship was the lack of an automatic fire suppression system on the aft mooring deck and the lack of an automatic means of mitigating the spread of smoke and fire through the ventilation ducts. Passengers received a full refund and were offered a complimentary cruise for the inconvenience.|$|E
50|$|First {{established}} in the early 1860s Strathmore Homestead has evolved to comprise {{a large number of}} buildings, structures and yards constructed from possibly the earliest establishment of the site through the nineteenth century to {{the latter part of the}} twentieth century. Structures include a slab hut (currently used to accommodate the kitchen and dining room for station personnel), <b>main</b> homestead, <b>laundry,</b> office, stables, meathouses, swimming pool complex, various cottages, homestead gardens, former school, former zoo, sheds, weir and a private cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The {{rail bed}} of the Delaware and Hudson line runs along {{the eastern shore of}} the lake, past the Buck Pond campground, and that of the Adirondack Division of the New York Central Railroad runs along the western shore past the {{remaining}} buildings of Stony Wold: the beautiful chapel and two cottages on the lake shore. When it was built, the 1200-acre sanatorium property included all of Lake Kushaqua and nearby Buck Pond, purchased in 1901 for $20,000. When the sanatorium closed in the 1950s, it was given to the White Fathers of Africa; they sold it to the state in 1970, after which the huge <b>main</b> building, <b>laundry</b> and power plant were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|The Xeros Washing Machine is a {{new kind}} of clothes washing {{technology}} that cleans laundry using primary nylon polymer beads and very little water. The machine releases nylon polymer beads into a <b>main</b> compartment where <b>laundry</b> is washed. These beads are small and super absorbent which allows them to go through clothing to absorb dirt and stains. This technology is invented by University of Leeds professor Stephen Burkinshaw, who currently has partnership with Xeros Ltd. in perfecting this technology.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 20, 1998, Ecstasy departed the Port of Miami, Florida, en route to Key West, Florida, with 2,565 passengers and 916 crew members aboard. A fire started in the <b>main</b> <b>laundry</b> room and spread through the ventilation system to the aft mooring deck, where mooring lines ignited. As Ecstasy was attempting to reach an anchorage north of the Miami sea buoy, the vessel lost power and began to drift. The master then radioed the U.S. Coast Guard for assistance. Six tugboats responded to help fight the fire and tow Ecstasy. The fire was brought under control by onboard firefighters and was extinguished about 9:09 PM. Fourteen crew members and eight passengers suffered minor injuries. One passenger required medical treatment {{as a result of}} a pre-existing condition and was categorized as a serious injury victim because of the length of her hospital stay. Losses from the fire and associated damages exceeded $17 million.|$|E
40|$|In the {{long-term}} cooperative project Voluntary Plan of Action (1990) between the Dutch Soap and Detergent Association (NVZ) and the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) environmental risk assessments of several <b>main</b> components of <b>laundry</b> cleaning formulations were completed. As {{a part of}} that project the environmental risk assessment of HEDP, ATMP, EDTMP and DTPMP phosphonates used in detergent applications has been carried out according to the EU Technical Guidance Document for Environmental Risk Assessment for New and Existing Chemicals. All PEC/PNEC ratios were well below 1. Results of this assessment based on the total industry volumes from 1995 and 1998 indicate that the environmental risk of these phosphonates is low in the Netherlands with properly functioning sewage treatment plants. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|When it was {{produced}} the reception was positive but surprised, with RPGamer declaring [...] "The Smallville RPG {{is perhaps the}} most peculiar release of this year. Everything about its cover screams 'mediocre at best' — the cable television series license, the Margaret Weis productions and Cortex System logos, even the studio promo picture recycled as cover art would have led to plummeting expectations. ... But this volume proves that one should never judge a book by its cover. You should instead judge a book by its inside cover, which features a crew of up-and-coming indie designers in the <b>main</b> credits and <b>laundry</b> list of Evil Hat veterans in the special thanks section. If covers aren't enough a read-through, will reveal that Smallville is a great story game ideally suited for teen drama that has been cunningly disguised as a cheap TV tie-in." ...|$|R
500|$|In July 1883, the {{steamship}} Rishanglys left three seamen on {{the island}} who {{were believed to be}} suffering from cholera, one of whom subsequently died. The only accommodation was a canvas tent, and the regular inhabitants of the island petitioned Cardiff council for compensation, complaining of loss of income from visitors and difficulty in selling vegetables grown on their farm at the market in Cardiff. In 1896, the Marquis of Bute, then-owner of Flat Holm, agreed to lease all the land that was not already in use by the military or the lighthouse to the Cardiff Corporation for £50 per year. The corporation then built a permanent sanatorium on the land for use by cholera patients. The building was described in The Lancet as a [...] "pavilion" [...] comprising two six-bed wards and a nurse's room. In 1893, three more sailors arrived in Cardiff from Marseilles on the SS Blue Jacket and were suspected of having cholera. The first engineer, Thomas Smith, and able seaman Robert Doran, were deported to the isolation hospital on Flat Holm to prevent spread of the disease. The second mate, P. J. Morris, was also sent to the island as a precautionary measure, but quickly recovered. The Flat Holm sanatorium is unique in being the only Victorian isolation hospital sited on a British offshore island. The last patient to die in the hospital, a victim of bubonic plague, was cremated {{on the island}} {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The hospital finally closed in 1935 and has remained derelict since. Both the hospital <b>main</b> block and <b>laundry</b> block are Grade II listed buildings and are considered to be [...] "at risk".|$|R
50|$|Residence halls provide many {{facilities}} for students. With over 15,000 resident students, 5 different campuses {{each with its}} own identity, 58 residence halls, 4 dining halls and 30-plus food courts/cafés, students can find everything they need right on campus. Despite some over-crowding, students wishing to live on-campus are usually accommodated, with a lottery system for non-incoming freshmen determining the order in which students choose their preferred housing (With the exception of Demarest Hall, which exempts students from the lottery system {{as long as they are}} contracted to special interest sections, and BEST (Busch Engineering, Science, and Technology) Hall, which is open only to students from SAS, SOE,and Pharmacy, and exempts them from the lottery if they got into the hall as a freshman). Single, double, and triple-occupancy rooms (in traditional residence halls), apartments housing four students each, and suites housing six (or four, as in BEST Hall) students each are available. Rooms and apartments are single-sex, with the exception of married graduate student housing, which also permit children of students. The other exceptions to this rule are the Livingston Apartments, Demarest Hall, and Rainbow Perspective Special Interest Rooms in New Gibbons. (These, however require special applications to be made) Most floors and buildings are co-ed, with the exception of Douglass Residential College {{facilities for}} women. Rooms usually contain beds, desks, chairs, dressers, and a closet for each student. Cable/internet access are also provided, but due to the widespread use of mobile phones, traditional land-line phone service is no longer provided in the halls. Many residence halls include <b>laundries,</b> <b>main</b> lounges with TVs, foosball and ping-pong, floor lounges with sofas, study tables, and kitchenettes, study lounges, and vending machines. Every floor or house has a resident assistant, an upper class student mentor who has received special training and is responsible for handling a number of tasks, such as planning programs and events, monitoring for safety, and documenting policy and procedure violations.|$|R
