50|$|Mexico {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} countries in the world for journalists. More than 100 media workers have been kidnapped and/or killed since 2000, and most of the crimes against the press remain unsolved and with few perpetrators arrested. The state of Veracruz, in addition, is the most dangerous state in Mexico for journalists. At least fifteen journalists have been killed and four more remain disappeared since 2000 (at least ten of them were killed between 2010 and 2014). Many of the journalists killed in Veracruz wrote about organized crime and corruption. The most recent incident in Veracruz prior to Sánchez's abduction was the kidnapping and murder of Gregorio Jiménez de la Cruz in February 2014. Sánchez was the first journalist kidnapped and killed in Mexico in 2015. On January 4, 2015, two days after his abduction, former Televisa reporter Jazmín Martínez Sánchez was killed in the State of Nayarit. A day later, another <b>media</b> <b>worker</b> was killed.

50|$|Under his management, La Unión {{covered a}} variety of topics, though it was {{characterized}} for its critical and direct reporting style. Sánchez was known for publishing articles about organized crime violence stemming from drug trafficking, local political corruption, traffic accidents, community concerns, and government mismanagement. He was also active on his personal Facebook page, where he made posted about public works left incomplete by the local government, like street potholes and water leaks. Sánchez also worked as a photographer and reporter for media outlets in the Veracruz-Boca del Río metropolitan area. He did not receive money for {{his work as a}} <b>media</b> <b>worker,</b> however. Sánchez provided for his family by being a taxi driver and owning a small grocery store. He was a taxi driver for two reasons: Sánchez wanted to earn enough money to make a living for his family. But he was also wanted that job because it allowed him to talk with people from his hometown on a daily basis. This provided a venue for him to collect information about citizens' pleas for his publications. His colleagues described Sánchez as a dedicated news gatherer, {{despite the fact that he}} was self-taught and had no professional training in journalism. Because Medellín de Bravo is semi-rural and located outside of the Veracruz metropolitan area, many media outlets do not report what occurs in the region. Official journalists relied on his information to report what occurred in Medellín de Bravo. According to his son, Sánchez was kidnapped for his journalism, given that he reported on violence in Medellín de Bravo and had received death threats. He believed this because the kidnappers did not take any money or valuable belongings from the house, and went specifically for Sánchez and his belongings related to his profession as a reporter. Weeks prior to his kidnapping, Sánchez had written about the public security problems in Medellín de Bravo.|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 2015, Governor Duarte {{told reporters}} {{at a press}} conference that all lines of {{investigation}} were being considered in the case. However, reporters stated that Duarte had simply referred to Sánchez as a [...] "taxi driver and neighborhood activist" [...] instead of mentioning his profession as a <b>media</b> <b>worker.</b> [...] "Our priority {{is to be able to}} locate him to return him to his family," [...] Duarte said. When questioned about the mayor's involvement, Duarte said that it was being considered. Investigators alleged that Sánchez's reports at La Unión and in his Facebook page reportedly angered Cruz Reyes. This line of investigation holds that three days before his kidnapping, Sánchez learned through a trusted source that the mayor had plans to silence him to [...] "teach him a lesson". The family suspects that Cruz Reyes masterminded the kidnapping because he was angry at Sánchez for his critical remarks against the local government. In an interview that day, the mayor, however, denied his involvement in Sánchez's kidnapping, said he was worried and saddened about the incident, and agreed to cooperate in the investigation. He said that he had not met with Sánchez's family members in order to not obstruct the investigation. Cruz Reyes said that his collaborators have been working closely with the family, however. The Mayor also said that he had a clear conscience and that Sánchez was a close friend of his. [...] "Sánchez was with our team during our political campaign ... we were very close to him," [...] Cruz Reyes stated. People close to Sánchez claimed that the mayor and Sánchez were friends until December 2012, and that they were often seen together at political campaigns when Cruz Reyes was running for office. However, when Cruz Reyes did not appoint Sánchez as head of the Director of Social Communication in Medellín de Bravo, a post he wanted, problems began to surface. Instead of entrusting Sánchez to that position, they said, the mayor appointed a female reporter from Veracruz, and this ended up creating animosity between the two. After this incident, Sánchez began to take critical stances against Cruz Reyes in his reports.|$|E

40|$|Background. The violent {{deaths of}} media workers is a {{critical}} issue worldwide, especially in areas {{of political and social}} instability. Such deaths can be a particular concern as they may undermine the development and functioning of an open and democratic society. Method. Data on the violent deaths of media workers in Iraq for ten years (2003 – 2012) were systematically collated from five international databases. Analyses included time trends, weapons involved, nationality of the deceased, outcome for perpetrators and location of death. Results. During this ten-year period, there were 199 violent deaths of media workers in Iraq. The annual number increased substantially after the invasion in 2003 (peaking at n = 47 in 2007) and then declined (n = 5 in 2012). The peak years (2006 – 2007) for these deaths matched the peak years for estimated violent deaths among civilians. Most of the <b>media</b> <b>worker</b> deaths (85 %) were Iraqi nationals. Some were killed whilst on assignment in the field (39 %) and 28 % involved a preceding threat. Common perpetrators of the violence were: political groups (45 %), and coalition forces (9 %), but the source of the violence was often unknown (29 %). None of the perpetrators have subsequently been prosecuted (as of April 2014). For each violent death of a <b>media</b> <b>worker,</b> an average of 3. 1 other people were also killed in the same attack (range 0 – 100 other deaths). Discussion. This analysis highlights the high number of homicides of media workers in Iraq in this conflict period, in addition to the apparently total level of impunity. One of the potential solutions may be establishing a functioning legal system that apprehends offenders and puts them on trial. The relatively high quality of data on violent deaths in this occupational group, suggests that it could act as one sentinel population within a broader surveillance system of societal violence in conflict zones...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} entomopathogenic organisms to control leaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Attini). However, the way leaf-cutting ants react as a colony to biohazards is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes) applied to the foraging arenas of mini-nests (queenless sub-colonies) of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa (Forel). Dry spores were applied either alone or mixed with citrus powder, at 0. 5 g or 0. 05 g per mini-nest. The spores were removed four days after application, and all dead ants removed every three days. Ant numbers near the Metarhizium increased as the ants attempted to clean up the biohazard. The ants attempted to place the spores in piles, which they then covered over with other material. They were able to deal with the low doses in this way, but the high doses overwhelmed them. All treated mini-nests suffered increased ant mortality during the first ten days after application. This mortality was particularly high in the <b>media</b> <b>worker</b> caste which had played the major role in attempting to clean up the spores. Foraging activity decreased, as did the health of the fungus gardens. The mini-nests exposed to the low dose of spores mixed with citrus powder then recovered fully. The health of the other treated mini-nests declined gradually until around 26 days after application, when they began deteriorating sharply. However, the decline of these mini-nests after day 26 was not due directly to the pathogenic action of the Metarhizium, nor to the initial ant mortality it had caused. The results suggest that the social stress caused by even such a short-lived Metarhizium epizootic was sufficient to cause the decline and ultimate death of the mini-nests. This has important implications for the control of leaf-cutting ants. It also demonstrates how important the social homeostasis of the colony is to leaf-cutting ants...|$|E
