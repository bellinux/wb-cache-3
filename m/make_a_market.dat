5000|$|Systemic risk is {{the risk}} that an {{amplification}} or leverage or positive feedback process presents to a system. This is usually unknown, and under certain conditions this process can amplify exponentially and rapidly lead to destructive or chaotic behavior. A Ponzi scheme {{is a good example}} of a positive-feedback system: funds from new investors are used to pay out unusually high returns, which in turn attract more new investors, causing rapid growth toward collapse. W. Brian Arthur has also studied and written on positive feedback in the economy (e.g. W. Brian Arthur, 1990). Hyman Minsky proposed a theory that certain credit expansion practices could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> economy into [...] "a deviation amplifying system" [...] that could suddenly collapse, sometimes called a [...] "Minsky moment".|$|E
5000|$|Once a {{fair price}} has been determined, the sell-side trader can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> on the security. Therefore, {{derivatives}} pricing is a complex [...] "extrapolation" [...] exercise to define the current market value of a security, which is then used by the sell-side community. Quantitative derivatives pricing was initiated by Louis Bachelier in The Theory of Speculation ("Théorie de la spéculation", published 1900), {{with the introduction of}} the most basic and most influential of processes, the Brownian motion, and its applications to the pricing of options. Bachelier modeled the time series of changes in the logarithm of stock prices as a random walk in which the short-term changes had a finite variance. This causes longer-term changes to follow a Gaussian distribution.|$|E
50|$|A risk {{reversal}} is {{a position}} which simulates {{profit and loss}} behavior of owning an underlying security; therefore it is sometimes called a synthetic long. This is an investment strategy that amounts to both buying and selling out-of-money options simultaneously. In this strategy, the investor will first <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> hunch; if that hunch is bullish he will want to go long. However, instead of going long on the stock, he will buy an {{out of the money}} call option, and simultaneously sell an out of the money put option. Presumably he will use the money from the sale of the put option to purchase the call option. Then as the stock goes up in price, the call option will be worth more, and the put option will be worth less.|$|E
40|$|The {{tradition}} of modern political economy is founded upon attempts {{to show how}} <b>a</b> <b>market</b> economy of autonomous individuals can function smoothly {{in the absence of}} a central authority to coordinate economic activity. This has become known, for obvious reasons, as the coordination problem. As suggested by the title of this article, to confront the coordination problem is to focus upon the question, ‘what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> economy?’. In the pages that follow, I argue that the answer to such a question lies not, as we might expect, in the realm of economics, but in that of moral philosophy. In order to sustain this argument, I revisit debates about the essence of the market economy which are to be found in the history of economic thought literature, but which are almost entirely ignored by modern economists...|$|R
