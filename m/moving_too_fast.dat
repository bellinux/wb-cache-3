500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E

5000|$|Rototiller: The small {{rototiller}} {{is typically}} propelled forward via a (1-5 horsepower or 0.8-3.5 kilowatts) petrol engine rotating the tines, {{and do not}} have powered wheels, though they may have small transport/level control wheel(s). To keep the machine from <b>moving</b> forward <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> an adjustable tine is usually fixed just behind the blades so that through friction with deeper un-tilled soil, it acts as a brake, slowing the machine and allowing it to pulverize the soils. The slower a rototiller moves forward, the more soil tilth can be obtained. The operator can control the amount of friction/braking action by raising and lowering the handlebars of the tiller. Rototillers often do not have a reverse as such backwards movement towards the operator could cause serious injury. While operating, the rototiller can be pulled backwards to go over areas that were not pulverized enough, but care must be taken to ensure that the operator does not stumble and pull the rototiller on top of himself. Rototilling is much faster than manual tilling, but notoriously difficult to handle and exhausting work, especially in the heavier and higher horsepower models. If the rototiller's blades catch on unseen subsurface objects, such as tree roots and buried garbage, it can cause the rototiller to abruptly and violently move in any direction.|$|R

[...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible.

[...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 January 1918, the Light Cruiser Force sortied from Rosyth to {{participate}} in a training exercise with elements of the Grand Fleet. The 12th and 13th Submarine Flotillas were sandwiched by squadrons of battlecruisers and battleships as the ships departed in poor visibility. Around 19:14 the steering gear of one of the 13th SF's submarines failed and she fell out of the formation. One of the trailing submarines did not see her in time and accidentally rammed her, badly damaging both boats. Commander William Leir commanded the 13th SF and decided to turn his flotilla around to their aid after he was notified of the accident around 17:40. In doing so, his ships crossed the path of the oncoming 12th SF and Fearless accidentally rammed and sank the submarine [...] Captain Charles Little attempted to avoid her, but the cruiser was <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> to do so. She launched her boats in a failed attempt to rescue any survivors, but the few found were recovered by one of the other submarines. The bulkheads in Fearless bow had to be shored up to prevent further flooding, but she was not in any danger of sinking and returned to Rosyth at a very slow speed. She was repaired and survived the war, but was sold for scrap in November 1921.|$|E
500|$|Pines of Rome was {{the first}} piece Disney {{suggested}} for the film, {{as well as the}} first to be animated; designs appeared in the studio's dailies as early as October 1993. Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story. The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of [...] "something flying". Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow Post-it notes. The story originally involved the whales flying around {{from the perspective of a}} group of penguins, but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character. The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it [...] "never felt quite right", leading to the decision to have them break through a cloud ceiling and enter a different world by the supernova. Butoy created a [...] "musical intensity chart" [...] for the animators to follow which [...] "tracked the ups and downs of the music... as the music brightens so does the color", and vice versa. He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development, the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move. When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system, Butoy found the whales were either <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> or had less weight to them. The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and [...] "more believable". The eyes of the whales were drawn by hand, as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI. Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible; the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time consuming and would have produced undesired results. The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into, overlap, or go through each other. The same technique was used for the stampede scene in The Lion King (1994), which was produced at the same time.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The 1978 Yukon Territorial {{election}} {{was the first}} to be contested by all three territorial political parties. The Yukon Territorial Progressive Conservative Party, which won the election, quickly demanded constitutional change, and received a positive response from the federal Progressive Conservative government in 1979. The Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, Jake Epp, acceded to the Yukon Government’s request and issued a letter of instruction to the federally appointed Commissioner, Ione Christensen. He ordered her to divest herself of her portfolio responsibilities and not participate in executive decision making. Mrs. Christensen immediately resigned, stating that she did not want the role of a de facto Lieutenant Governor. Her resignation triggered a debate in the Yukon legislature and the media over whether the Territory was <b>moving</b> “too far, <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> ” toward provincial status. Academics and politicians have also debated whether the changes effected by the “Epp letter ” were significant and irreversible, or merely a “sop ” to assuage local sentiments. The anomaly of the Yukon’s constitutional status in Canada is raised as a consequence of this debate...|$|R

It also received numerous comparisons to videos by Britney Spears and Lady Gaga, though Cyrus said she [...] "wanted {{it to be}} something different for a female artist". Cristina Gibson of E! described the video as [...] "edgy", similar to Cyrus' video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", but [...] "on steroids". Tina Warren of MTV News said the video was a good step toward ridding Cyrus of her good-girl image and gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "intriguing" [...] and stating, [...] "The video [...] is actually quite magnetic and you can’t look away". Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly agreed. While he acknowledged the video [...] "might be dark and a tad conceptually racy", he claimed it was smart move.

Rather, Stransky said Cyrus had [...] "some super-fun dance moves" [...] and [...] " [...] a statement", albeit a darker one.

The website, Yahoo! added the video {{to the list of}} [...] "Worst Music Videos of 2010" [...] Daniel Rutledge of 3 News in New Zealand said Cyrus had made [...] "it very clear she wishes to cast aside any resemblance to the Disney alter ego that made her famous and be regarded from now on as an adult singer." [...] Singaporean newspaper My Paper defended Cyrus against claims that the video was too provocative and reported, [...] "If nothing else, this vid shows that Cyrus knows how to entertain, and marks the beginning of truly high-quality videos." [...] Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com offered a contrary opinion, stating that while Cyrus is a [...] "talented singer [...] deserves to break out of her Disney mold", the [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] music video was poor. Williams said Cyrus has [...] "talent galore" [...] and [...] "incredible pipes", but her video was [...] "predictable, derivative and dumb" [...] due to its unoriginality. According to People magazine, online reaction to the music video has been greatly varied. [...] "Fans and bloggers lit up the Web with comments ranging from 'stunning, gorgeous, fierce' to 'wow way too much for someone her age'", the magazine reported.

60|$|This flock {{was known}} to be grazing in a side draw, well up from Grass Valley, where the brush afforded some {{protection}} from the sun, and there was good water and a little feed. Before Jean reached his destination he heard a shot. It was not a rifle shot, which fact caused Jean a little concern. Evarts and Bernardino had rifles, but, to his knowledge, no small arms. Jean rode up on one of the black-brushed conical hills that rose {{on the south side of}} Grass Valley, and from there he took a sharp survey of the country. At first he made out only cattle, and bare meadowland, and the low encircling ridges and hills. But presently up toward the head of the valley he descried a bunch of horsemen riding toward the village. He could not tell their number. That dark moving mass seemed to Jean to be instinct with life, mystery, menace. Who were they? It was too far for him to recognize horses, let alone riders. They were <b>moving</b> <b>fast,</b> <b>too.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{state of}} mind in which poor Walter had gone to Captain Cuttle's, on the day when Brogley the broker came into possession, and when there seemed to him to be an {{execution}} in the very steeples, {{was pretty much the}} same as that in which Florence now took her way to Uncle Sol's; with this difference, that Florence suffered the added pain of thinking that she had been, perhaps, the innocent occasion of involving Walter in peril, and all to whom he was dear, herself included, in an agony of suspense. For the rest, uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything. The weathercocks on spires and housetops were mysterious with hints of stormy wind, and pointed, like so many ghostly fingers, out to dangerous seas, where fragments of great wrecks were drifting, perhaps, and helpless men were rocked upon them into a sleep as deep as the unfathomable waters. When Florence came into the City, and passed gentlemen who were talking together, she dreaded to hear them speaking of the ship, an'd saying it was lost. Pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm. The smoke and clouds, though <b>moving</b> gently, moved <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> for her apprehensions, and made her fear there was a tempest blowing at that moment on the ocean.|$|R

Barrage lifts were determined by a time-table, {{based on the assumption}} that delays in the infantry advance, to wait for the barrage to move on were preferable to the risk of it <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> and allowing German troops time to emerge from shelters and engage the infantry with small-arms fire.

Again and again she went to Dr. Morton and some of the bishops, trying to show the imperative needs in the Church for a connectional organization known distinctively as home missions; but the objection was presented that the Church was not ready for such an organization. She was told that the Parsonage Society had hardly gotten a sure footing in the Church at that time, and by <b>moving</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> and undertaking to enlarge the work to such an extent, she would find it impracticable and calculated to do more harm than good. She insisted that it would not interfere with the parsonage work.
