50|$|The glumes are lanceolate, membranous, and keelless, have acute apexes, {{with the}} only {{difference}} being in size. The upper one is 5.5 - 8.5 mm long while {{the other one is}} ovate and is 6 - 10 mm long. Fertile lemma is 6.5 - 9.5 mm long and is also chartaceous, elliptic and keelless with scaberulous surface. Lemma itself is <b>muticous</b> with acute apex. Flowers have a hairy ovary and three stamens that are 2 - 2.5 mm long.

50|$|The {{species is}} {{perennial}} and caespitose with erect and slender culms that are 10 - 45 cm long. It have a ligule that {{goes around the}} ciliolate membrane and is 0.2 - 0.4 mm long. Leaf-blades are flat and are 10 - 25 cm long and 1.5 - 3 mm wide. The panicle is capitated, oblong, ovate and inflorescenced with a diameter being 1 - 3 cm by 0.5 - 0.7 cm. Spikelets are oblong, solitary, and are 4 - 7 mm long with pedicelled fertile ones. Sterile spikelets grow in pairs and carry 2-3 fertile florets. Both upper and lower glumes are 4 - 7 mm long and are also ovate, membranous, glaucous, with a single keel and vein, and with acuminated and <b>muticous</b> apexes. Fertile lemma is ovate, membranous, and is 4 - 6 mm long. Flowers have three stamens, two stigmas, and are hairy. The fruits have caryopses which have an additional pericarp, a hairy apex, and elliptic hilum.|$|E
50|$|The species culms are {{prostrate}} and are 10 - 25 cm long. The leaf-blades are ovate and are 1 - 3 cm {{long and}} 2.5 - 5 mm wide. It has an obscure cross veins venetation. The species also has 3-4 unilateral racemes which are located along the central axis, and are 1 - 2 cm long. The {{central part of}} the inflorescence axis is 3 - 6 cm long. It also has angular rhachis which bottom is glabrous. The spikelets grow in pairs and are 2 - 5 mm apart from each other. They are also fertile, pedicelled, and sessile, with pedicels being oblong. They grow in a cluster of 2 and are subequal. Glumes are shorter than a spikelet and thinner than fertile lemma. The lower glume is ovate and have a pubescent surface. Its apex is acute and 1 awned. The awn is 0.5 - 1.5 mm long, has no vesture, but is scaberulous. The upper glume is ovate as well but is herbaceous, 1-keeled and has veins of 5-7. Just like the lower glume it is pubescent on the bottom, but have an obtuse apex which can also be mucronate or <b>muticous</b> as well. Florets are 1-keeled and pubescent just like glumes but are 7-11 veined. The lower sterile floret of the lemma is ovate and is 1 length of a spikelet which is also emarginate, membranous and mucronate. The fertile lemma is coriaceous, keelless, oblong, shiny and is 2 - 2.5 mm long with involute margins and acute apex.|$|E
40|$|Trees or shrubs, {{very rarely}} herbs or fleshy saprophytes. Leaves spiral, {{sometimes}} opposite or pseudowhorled, simple, entire, crenate or serrate, mostly evergreen and ± coriaceous (Malesia), exstipulate (stipule-like perulae of axillary buds occur in Diplycosia and Vaccinium p. p.). Flowers bisexual (rarely functionally unisexual; or the plant dioecious in extra-Mal.), characteristically regular, (4 -) 5 (rarely 6 - 7) -merous. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, entirely covered by perulae in bud, mostly in racemes, these sometimes arranged to panicles or condensed to umbels, or reduced to few-flowered fascicles, {{or even to}} a solitary flower. Sepals (reduced in Monotropastrum and Wirtgenia) very rarely free, generally connate below to a calyx tube, the latter free or ± adnate to the ovary, persistent, whether or not accrescent in fruit, lobes imbricate or open in bud. Corolla campanulate to funnel-shaped, urceolate or cylindric, sometimes slightly zygomorphous, caducous, lobed to various degree, lobes imbricate (sometimes ± contorted), rarely valvate in bud. Stamens usually 10 (rarely 5, 8, or up to 20), obdiplostemonous, rarely haplostemonous, inserted at the outer margin of the disk between its lobes, or slightly attached {{to the base of}} the corolla; filaments free (Malesia); anthers dorsifixed to almost basifixed, the 2 cells (thecae) not rarely extending into free or connate tubules, these <b>muticous</b> or sometimes (bi) aristate distally by the prolonged back-wall, opening by terminal or introrse, very rarely extrorse pores or slits, not rarely with projecting dorsal appendages or spurs; pollen in tetrads, simple in Monotropoideae. Gynoecium syncarpous, 5 - or pseudo- 10 -, rarely 2 - 4 - or 6 - 7 -celled. Disk hypogynous or epigynous, often fleshy and nectariferous, entire or mostly 5 - 10 -lobed. Ovary 1, superior, half-inferior or inferior, generally with as many cells as carpels; placentation central, with 1 or 2 lamellas per cell, each bearing mostly numerous, rarely 1, anatropous or obliquely amphitropous, 1 -tegumented ovulus. Style 1; stigma obtuse, capitate or peltate, whether or not 5 - 7 -lobed. Fruit a 5 (- 7) -valved, septicidal or (sometimes lately or irregularly) loculicidal capsule, which may be ± included by the accrescent, ± fleshy calyx, or a rather dry to fleshy berry (Malesia). Seeds usually numerous, small, whether or not winged or tailed at one or both ends; testa thin, often reticulate; embryo cylindric, small, with copious endosperm. Distribution. About 125 genera with approximately 3500 spp., predominantly woody, all over the world...|$|E
