25|$|Throughout {{the crisis}} the Russian and Ukrainian sides blamed {{each other for}} the cutoff. On January 11 and 12, the European Union {{deployed}} an independent monitoring mission in an attempt to solve the crisis, but the mission met with little success. On January 12, Gazprom announced that it was willing to start delivering gas through the Sudzha <b>metering</b> <b>station</b> into the pipeline that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer for technical reasons and instead suggested an alternative route through Valuyki and Pisarevka metering stations, additionally insisting that supplies be fully restored. This was refused by Gazprom.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas <b>metering</b> <b>station</b> to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

2500|$|On January 12, Gazprom {{announced}} that it was ready to start delivering gas through the Sudzha <b>metering</b> <b>station</b> that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer, claiming this would have left its eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and portions of Dnipropetrovsk starved of gas. [...] Naftogaz suggested an alternative route through the Valuyki and Pisarevka metering stations, but later added that it was unprepared to partially accept gas for transfer to Europe. It insisted that deliveries be fully restored because the system had been partially reconfigured to work in reverse in order to supply consumers in eastern Ukraine with backup supplies, and European transit pipelines were working {{in such a way that}} they were unable to accept Russian gas for transit to Europe without cutting off those eastern regions. [...] Naftogaz added that a resumption of transit would require conclusion of a technical agreement. According to a report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies: [...] "This reversal of one of the world’s largest gas transit systems was unprecedented. It seems hard to believe that it could have been undertaken spontaneously, which suggests that, whichever side precipitated the shutdown, Naftogaz's engineers had prepared for it."

40|$|Between 1958 and 1961 a net of {{accurate}} gravity <b>meter</b> <b>stations</b> {{was established}} in Tanganyika, N. Rhodesia and Nyasaland, with a few stations in Kenya, Uganda, S. Rhodesia and Bechuanaland. There are now 109 gravity stations in the area with a relative accuracy of better than 0. 1 mgal, and an accuracy of about 0. 5 mgal relative to the Potsdam system. The net was primarily intended to provide control for a regional gravity survey of Tanganyika, but has also served to connect several other formerly isolated gravity surveys to the international system. Most of the pendulum and gravity <b>meter</b> <b>stations</b> established by other observers before 1958 were reoccupied. When these sets of measurements are compared with the Overseas Geological Survey net individually there are slight differences of datum and calibration, but the mean discrepancies are negligible. The linearity of the cali-bration factors of the O. G. S. gravity meters was confirmed {{by a series of}} tilt-table calibrations. Before 1954 the Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre-Mer had established several im-portant chains of gravity <b>meter</b> <b>stations</b> from Europe, through North, West and East Africa to Madagascar. The O. R. S. T. O. M. values now appear to have been computed with an incorrect calibration factor but otherwise had a high relative accuracy. I. Earlier measurements The first gravity observations in this part of Africa were Kohlschutter’s pendulum measurements in Tanganyika in 1890. In 1936, Bullard and Horsfield made further observations in East Africa with the Cambridge pendulums. The main purpose of these measurements was to test isostatic theory in an area of large mean elevation. In 1948, Hales and Gough established stations in South Africa and Rhodesia with the Cambridge pendulums to provide control for a regional gravity meter survey of South Africa.
