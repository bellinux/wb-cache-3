40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (Hurst, 1933) the histology of pseudorabies in the rabbit has been considered. While clearly possessed of neurotropic affinities, in this animal the virus does not behave as a strict neurotrope, but produces intranuclear inclusions in cells derived from any embryonic layer. It is interesting now to compare, from the experimental standpoint, {{the manner of}} spread of this virus {{with that of the}} more purely neurotropic viruses (poliomyelitis, rabies, Borna). Technique The incubation periods in four rabbits inoculated subcutaneously with 1 co. of the supernatant fluid from a 10 per cent unglycerinated brain suspension lasted 51, 52, 54 and 57 hours respectively. With amounts of suspension near the <b>minimal</b> <b>infecting</b> <b>dose,</b> or with very old glycerinated material, the incubation period may be 8 days or longer. In all the passage experiments listed in the following tables fresh material was employed, and a long incubation period was taken as indicating the presence of a minimal amount of virus; except where otherwise stated 1 co. of a 10 per cent suspension constituted the test dose. The <b>minimal</b> <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> of the Iowa strain of virus was determined for rabbits by Shope (1933) to be not greater than 0. 01 rag. wet brain for intracerebral inoculation, and 0. 1 nag. for subcutaneous inoculation. Recent tests indicate that the latter dose lies between 0. 1 and 0. 01 mg., and is often nearer the second figure. Where exact amounts of virus are mentioned in the ensuing experiments the inoculum was titrated for potency at the time of use and the quantities are stated in terms of the minimal dose for subcutaneous inoculation. Dr. M. H. Merrill has found the minimal subcutaneous infecting dose of the Aujeszky virus employed to lie between 0. 05 and 0. 025 nag. wet brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{infectivity}} of Actinomyces israelii in a susceptible-weanling-mouse {{was increased}} {{by the presence}} of Eikenella corrodens in the inoculum. A <b>minimal</b> <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> of 1. 7 X 10 (7) CFU of A. israelii was required to establish chronic lesions after an intraperitoneal injection. When E. corrodens (3. 8 X 10 (7) CFU) was included in the inoculum, chronic lesions were established with a dose of 8. 5 X 10 (4) CFU of A. israelii. E. corrodens alone did not produce persistent lesions. Viable E. corrodens could be recovered from chronic mixed actinomycotic lesions in numbers that often equaled or exceeded the populations of A. israelii in the lesions. The duration of acute actinomycotic infections caused by A. viscosus was temporarily extended {{by the presence of}} E. corrodens. The cellular inflammatory response and overall morphology of mixed experimental lesions containing A. israelii and E. corrodens {{did not appear to be}} significantly different from those of pure-culture lesions containing A. israelii alone. E. corrodens cells could not be readily discerned in stained histological sections of mixed experimental lesions...|$|E
40|$|Methylene blue (MB) and {{toluidine}} blue (TB) when administered in maximum tolerated oral doses to mice and to cotton rats are highly effective in preventing the usual lethal outcome of intraperitoneally induced infections with R. orientalis. This activity is manifest even when dye administration is delayed until a systemic infection {{has been well}} established. Methylene blue is also effective in cerebral infections in mice. The toxicity of MB, however, limits parenteral (subcutaneous) administration of the dye to dosage levels which are much less effective than the maximum tolerated oral levels. The inability of mice to tolerate an adequately effective parenteral dose of MB suggests that {{the properties of the}} dye responsible for its toxicity may be separated from those upon which its antirickettsial effect depends. The relationship between the response of mice to oral treatment with MB and such factors as the size of the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> and the times of initiation and of withdrawal of treatment may be summarized as follows: 1. With a constant <b>infecting</b> <b>dose,</b> the time of initiation of treatment largely determines the degree of therapeutic effect. 2. The interval after infection beyond which further treatment does not increase the survival rate depends not upon the previous duration of treatment but upon the size of the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose.</b> Paradoxically, treatment can be discontinued sooner after a massive <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> than after a smaller one...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{size of the}} <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> and severity of the resulting disease has been investigated for salmonella infections by reanalysis of data within epidemics for 32 outbreaks, and comparing data between outbreaks for 68 typhoid epidemics and 49 food-poisoning outbreaks due to salmonellas. Attack rate, incubation period, amount of infected food consumed and type of vehicle are used as proxy measures of <b>infecting</b> <b>dose,</b> while case fatality rates for typhoid and case hospitalization rates for food poisoning salmonellas {{were used to assess}} severity. Limitations of the data are discussed. Both unweighted and logit analysis models are used. There is no evidence for a dose-severity relationship for Salmonella typhi, but evidence of a correlation between dose and severity is available from within-epidemic or between-epidemic analysis, or both, for Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. infantis, S. newport, and S. thompson.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of antibody production against listeriolysin O (LLO), a major virulence {{factor of}} the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, was studied by dot blot analysis with highly purified LLO during oral infection of sheep. Specific antibodies appeared {{as soon as}} day 9 of an oral infection and peaked by day 20 of infection; specific antibody levels then remained almost stable for at least 4 months. A subclinical <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> (approximately 10 (6) viable bacteria) was capable of eliciting a significant antibody response to LLO, almost {{at the same level}} as that observed with a high-dose oral challenge (approximately 10 (10)). Antibodies to LLO were mostly constituted by immunoglobulin G (IgG), since an IgA response was not detectable and only a transient and inconstant IgM response was observed between day 9 and day 20 of an oral infection. These results show that antibodies to LLO are constantly produced during oral infection even with a low <b>infecting</b> <b>dose,</b> thus confirming that LLO is highly immunogenic. Detection of antibodies to LLO can therefore be used to detect sheep that have been previously exposed to L. monocytogenes...|$|R

40|$|Data are {{presented}} which {{show that the}} syngeneic C 57 B 1 / 6 mouse strain is far more susceptible to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H 37 Rv than are the other allogeneic mouse strains used in this laboratory, particularly the Strong A and the CF- 1 strains. Not only are the C 57 B 1 / 6 mice more susceptible to tuberculous infection, but also they respond to infection more uniformly than do the allogeneic strains. C 57 B 1 / 6 mice develop immunity to challenge with small <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of the virulent H 37 Rv strain when they are vaccinated with viable cells of the attenuated H 37 Ra strain and with ribonucleic acid (RNA) preparations isolated from the H 37 Ra strain. Mice vaccinated with viable cells of the H 37 Ra strain, however, may die more rapidly than nonvaccinated mice when given a large <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> (1. 0 mg). This accelerated type of disease is not seen in mice vaccinated with mycobacterial RNA. Since C 57 B 1 / 6 mice are known to develop tuberculin hypersensitivity more readily than many other mouse strains, the possibility is discussed that the increased susceptibility to tuberculous infection of mice vaccinated with viable cells of the H 37 Ra strain {{may be due to}} a superimposition of a pronounced acute inflammatory response due to tuberculin hypersensitivity upon the infectious process.

40|$|Since our {{original}} description of pneumococcus lobar pneumonia {{in the dog}} published in 1933 (1), {{we have made a}} large number of observations on this experimental disease. The findings we wish to present here deal with certain factors which influence the course and outcome of the infection. The most important of these is the size and distribution of the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose.</b> Our earlier studies indicated that within a limited range of dosage a definite relationship existed between the amount of culture inoculum and the outcome of the disease. It was found that inocula containing 0. 03 cc. or less of culture uncommonly produced death. With doses ranging from 0. 04 cc. to 0. 1 cc. the mortality rose progressively from 25 per cent to approximately 60 per cent. However, a further increase {{in the size of the}} <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> even to 0. 6 cc. or 1 cc. of culture, always suspended in 1 cc. of the starch broth medium, resulted in no higher death rate (Table I). This problem has been investigated further and by varying the methods of initiating the infection as detailed below we have been able to secure many additional data on the relationship of dosage to outcome. In the initial studies it was also recognized that early leucopenia, bacteremia and extensive pulmonary involvement were unfavorable prognostic signs, but the fewness of the data did not permit a quantitative correlation between these manifestations of the body's reaction and eventual recovery or death. The present observations on dogs undergoing their primary infection have provided material for the more satisfactory elucidation of such relationships. 229 230 LOBAR PNEUMONI...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{of white}} rats with Francisella tularensis (Pasteurella tularensis) and Salmonella typhimurium and {{exposure}} to the endotoxin of S. typhimurium stimulated significant increases in various serum enzymes including aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase. The rates of changes in enzymatic activity after infection were {{directly related to the}} size of <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> and to the type of infective agent employed. Tularemic infection stimulated excessive changes in enzyme activity, whereas salmonellosis and endointoxication elicited less pronounced alterations of relatively short duration.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of acute}} respiratory melioidosis mice and hamsters is described. Inhaled organisms {{giving rise to}} lesions seemed to be first engulfed by the mononuclear alveolar phagocytes, but in less than 1 day polymorphonuclear cells made their appearance. In spite of this defense reaction, the bacteria continued to multiply and their products caused focal necrosis. These foci enlarged and gave rise to septicemia, toxemia, and eventually death, which usually occurred in 3 to 10 days depending on the dose. Melioidosis, is, therefore, an acute septicotoxemic disease resembling plague and anthrax in this respect. In hamsters the disease process developed more rapidly than in mice and death occurred sooner. The course of the disease in hamsters was sometimes complicated by intraglomerular deposits resembling "fibrinoid," which {{were similar to those}} of the generalized Shwartzman phenomenon. This phenomenon may have been an indirect cause of both the perifocal hemorrhage and the extremely large number of bacteria in some of the hamster lesions. When low <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of organisms were employed, mice, but not hamsters, developed a chronic type of disease, lasting 2 to 8 weeks. This was characterized by large abscesses in the spleen or lung, marked proliferation of mononuclear phagocytes and plasma cells, and increased immunity against reinfection (about 40 -fold against respiratory challenge). When mice and hamsters inhaled high <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of organisms, a peracute disease resulted with death in 1 to 3 days. Increased numbers of bacteria were observed in the lesions, and the histological changes in the spleen resembled those following the intravenous injection of Malleomyces pseudomallei toxin or the intramuscular injection of large doses of cortisone. These changes were characterized by a swelling of the phagocytes of the white pulp with nuclear debris. The peracute, the acute, and the chronic forms of melioidosis in mice are similar to analogous clinical forms found in man...|$|R

40|$|The stress-induced {{protease}} ClpP {{is required}} for virulence of the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We previously found that {{in the absence of}} ClpP, the virulence of this pathogen was strongly reduced, mainly due to the decreased production of functional listeriolysin O (LLO), a major immunodominant virulence factor promoting intracellular growth. In this work, a clpP deletion mutant of L. monocytogenes was used to study the generation of anti-Listeria protective immunity. We found that ClpP {{is required for}} the intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes in resident macrophages in vivo. Mice <b>infected</b> with <b>doses</b> as high as 106 clpP mutant bacteria were not protected against a lethal challenge of wild-type bacteria and did not develop any detectable LLO-specific cytolytic T cells or antibodies, suggesting that the amount of LLO produced in infected mice under these conditions was too low to induce a specific immune response. However, in contrast to the results obtained with a mutant with a disrupted hly gene, this lack of protection was overcome by inoculation of very high <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of clpP mutant bacteria (5 × 108), thus producing sufficient amounts of LLO to stimulate anti-Listeria immunity. The role of ClpP was confirmed by showing that anti-Listeria immunity was restored in mice infected with a clpP-complemented mutant.

However, cells expressing the innate markers Gr- 1 and CD 11 c were affected to a greater degree by increasing dose than lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response (Th 1, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 19 +), resulting in a change in the balance of innate and adaptive cell numbers to favor innate cells at higher <b>infecting</b> <b>doses.</b> Surprisingly, we detected greater numbers of viable chlamydiae in the oviducts at lower inoculating doses, and the number of organisms appeared to directly correlate with hydrosalpinx formation after both primary infection and repeat infection.

40|$|We have {{described}} in a previous communication, a method {{for the production of}} experimental pneumococcus lobar pneumonia in the dog (1). Briefly this consists in the injection of small quantities of highly virulent pneumococci, suspended in a starch-broth medium, through a radio-opaque catheter inserted into a terminal bronchus with the dog under the fluoroscope. The experimental disease thus produced bore a close analogy, both in its clinical course and pulmonary pathology, to lobar pneumonia seen in the human being. The severity of the disease was, for the most part, found to be dependent upon the amount of culture injected. With doses of less than 0. 04 ch. the dogs always recovered. Increasing the dosage above this amount resulted in infections of greater intensity and with a mounting mortality until at 0. 25 cc. of culture death usually ensued. With a dose of 0. 4 cc. of culture death occurred regularly. This observed relationship between the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> and the outcom...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{polymerase}} chain reaction and of DNA sequencing of the Adel 2 mutant variant of adenovirus serotype 5, passaged 10 times and capable of selectively infecting and lysing the p 53 -deficient human tumor cells, are indicative of a high stability of its genotype and of the phenotypic properties acquired by it in successive passage on 293 cells. The absence of admixtures of wild-type adenovirus was clearly shown in the cultivation and passage processes. It was revealed in an experimental analysis of virus-productive properties of the studied continuous cell culture 293 by using the method of multilayer cultivation, that the maximal Adel 2 yield is obtained at the 50 % cytopathic effect. Virus doses, that are effective for cell-culture contamination, are within a range of 100 - 10 TCPE 50 per cell. In order to spare the viral material, the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> of 10 TCPE 50 per cell was chosen to infect a cell monolayer. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|Aerosolized {{influenza}} virus is inhaled and embeds in the respiratory mucosa, {{of the upper}} and lower respiratory tract. The virus is attracted to the glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides of the mucus coating the respiratory mucosa. If the <b>infecting</b> <b>dose</b> of virus is high, abundant viral neuraminidase breaks down the mucosallayer, allowing access of the virus to the underlying epithelial cells. The virus then attaches to epithelial cells through binding of the hemagglutinin spike to the N-acetylneuraminic acid receptor on the cell. The virus then enters the cell by endocytosis into the cell cytoplasm where it replicates to produce new virions that are released back into the respiratory tract by budding from the infected cell. The virus disperses throughout the trachea and bronchial tree within 3 days, causing hyperemia, edema, necrosis, desquamation, and focal erosion. Viremia is rare, but is possible if the virus crosses the basement membrane and enters the circulation, potentially causing inflammation of skeletal and cardiac muscle (myositis and myocarditis), encephalitic signs, and limb edema ...|$|R
40|$|The {{infectivity}} of 16 {{strains of}} Klebsiella spp. and its modification by systemic and local ferric iron {{were tested in}} {{the skin of the}} guinea-pig. The in vivo proliferation of 11 strains was enhanced in varying degrees by Fe+++ (E + strains); 5 strains (Eo) were not enhanceable even by large doses of Fe+++. Of 10 strains examined in detail, 6 were E + and 4 were E 0. Guinea-pig and human sera were consistently bacteriostatic for E + strains and bactericidal for Eo strains. Both Fe+++ and microbial iron-chelators abolished the bacteriostasis of E + strains but did not affect the lethal effect on Eo strains. Both effects were diminished by heating the sera to 56 degrees for 30 min and by the anticomplementary substance Liquoid; neither appeared to be due to specific antibody. Virulence, as measured in the skin and by intravenous injection, was roughly associated with degree of enhanceability by iron, the EO strains being among the least virulent. The volume of plasma exudate entering the skin during the first 5 h was sufficient to kill {{a large proportion of the}} <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of Eo strains and to inhibit the growth of <b>infecting</b> <b>doses</b> of E + strains. Enhancement of the latter by Fe+++ is predominantly the result of inhibition of the non-specific bacteriostasis exerted by the extravascular plasma. Lesions by E + strains aged 4 h or more are insusceptible to systemic Fe+++ and only moderately susceptible to large doses of local Fe+++. The insusceptibility appears to be due to segregation of the infecting bacilli within exudate leucocytes. Klebsiella infections accordingly provide another example of an initial decisive period of action of the antibacterial defences-in this case non-specific and humoral-which cease to be locally effective after the first few hours. Besides enhancing lesions due to E + strains, systemic Fe+++ has an opposite, apparently anti-inflammatory action on klebsiella lesions, slightly decreasing their size. It was evident with all the strains tested, whether dead or alive, but not in E + lesions in circumstances when they were susceptible to enhancement by the Fe+++...|$|R
