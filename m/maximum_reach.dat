500|$|The calibre {{and weight}} of guns could only {{increase}} so far. The larger the gun, the slower {{it would be to}} load, the greater the stresses on the ship's hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea. [...] carried two 16.25-inch (413mm) breech-loading guns, each weighing 110tons—no British battleship would ever carry guns as large. The Italian 450mm (17.72inch) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18.1-inch (460mm) armament of the Japanese [...] of World War II. [...] One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as 'floating weapons-platform' could negate the advantage of rifling. [...] American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least 'skip' along the surface of the water. [...] Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail—though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds. [...] Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the 'Age of the Ironclad' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the <b>maximum</b> <b>reach</b> of their ships' guns.|$|E

In this study we explored the constraints on this ability introduced by eyeheight-scaled information in the optic array.

Perceptual information was manipulated by changing the participants' optically specified eyeheight. Observers were modestly accurate in perceiving <b>maximum</b> overhead <b>reach</b> for themselves and for another actor whose action capabilities differed.

The results suggest an important role of perceptual information that has gone unrecognized in existing accounts of action understanding and prediction...|$|R
