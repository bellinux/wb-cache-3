50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation {{began looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the three 1950s icebreakers which were small and, despite their size, expensive to operate as they required a relatively large crew of 53. They were replaced by two large icebreakers, Otso and Kontio, featuring extensive automation, alternating current propulsion motors with cycloconverter drive, and a sleek hull form perfected in a model basin, {{but for the first}} time since the late 1800s no bow propellers. Around the same time, the National Board of Navigation also began looking for secondary uses for the icebreakers which were traditionally employed only for three to five months per year and spent the summer months moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. When the next class of post-war icebreakers was approaching the end of its economic life, it was decided to replace them with <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels</b> that could be chartered to support commercial offshore operations in oil fields when they were not needed in the Finnish waters. Three such multipurpose icebreakers were built in the 1990s: Fennica (1993), Nordica (1994), and Botnica (1998). The vessels, which were the first large icebreakers to utilize azimuth thrusters for propulsion, were sometimes criticized for their lower icebreaking performance and higher operational costs when compared to traditional icebreakers. Botnica, which had not been used for icebreaking in Finland for some years, was sold to Estonia in 2012.|$|E
50|$|While the {{existing}} Finnish icebreaker fleet was {{owned and operated}} solely by Arctia, the new icebreaker was initially intended to be owned by the Finnish Transport Agency and the operator would be selected through public tendering process. The new model was adopted from Sweden where the operation of state-owned icebreakers has been open for competition for years. Arctia, which practically has a monopoly in the icebreaker business in Finland, {{has been criticized for}} higher prices when compared to Swedish icebreakers as well as potentially subsidizing unprofitable offshore operations by charging premium charter from the Finnish Transport Agency for the <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels.</b> In October 2014, the newly appointed Finnish Minister of Transport Paula Risikko (National Coalition Party) questioned her predecessors' decision to order the icebreaker for an expert organization operating {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Transport and Communications instead of the state-owned shipping company which was established to own and manage the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet. In November 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposed the Finnish Transport Agency that the new icebreaker should be sold to Arctia. On 5 March 2015, it was officially announced that the Finnish Government had agreed to sell the new icebreaker to Arctia Icebreaking, a subsidiary of Arctia, for 128 million euro. Although the contract was officially signed on 20 April 2015, the ownership will be transferred when the vessel has been delivered in 2016. According to the contract, the shipping company is obliged to have the new icebreaker available for tendering procedures for Baltic Sea icebreaking services until the end of 2020.|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{examine the}} psycho-social impact of work {{schedules}} (absence from home) on {{the families of}} a subgroup of Norwegian seafarers as reported by their wives (sea wives). Their husbands worked 4 - 6 weeks on and 4 - 6 weeks off Norwegianregistered <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels</b> (MPV) supporting the off-shore oil industry. Methods – Questionnaires addressing demographic characteristics, marital satisfaction, social support, subjective health and psychological well-being were distributed to sea wives and controls. The response rate was 57 % (192 / 336) for sea wives and 39 % (45 / 114) for controls Results – There {{was no difference in}} demographic characteristics between sea wives and controls except that the sea wives were younger (p< 0. 01). No differences between sea wives and controls were found with regard to the quality of marital relationships, the subjective evaluation of own health, or mental well-being.

40|$|The Dutch {{shipbuilding}} {{industry has}} a real competitive force in building complex, specialized and <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels</b> (Rabobank, 2014). However, the Dutch maritime sector {{has to deal with}} strongly growing competition worldwide. For the dredging sector this implies the need to innovate in order to remain competitive. This research focuses on the strategy of vertical forward cooperation to do so; the supplier will move into the maintenance aspects of dredging equipment, benefiting both the client and the supplier by expanding their services. This led to the research question of how a supplier of dredging equipment can achieve forward cooperation in the product life cycle. As a case study the company of Royal IHC is used for this research, in specific the product type of the IHC Beaver dredger is discussed. The research is divided into six parts; (i) a literature study; where the possible strategies for the forward cooperation are studied; a case study, where the (ii) IST (current) situation and the (iii) SOLL (ideal) situation are defined according to the current situation at IHC and a benchmark study. A system characterization for warranty cost analysis by D. N. P. Murthy and W. R. Blischke (2006) that describes how warranty policy, product reliability and product usage ultimately influence the warranty costs is used to structure these situations. Then a GAP analysis follows (iv) where the IST and SOLL are compared. This leads to the (v) fifth part of the research: the framework on how to achieve forward cooperation, which is supported with a model. Finally (vi) the conclusions and recommendations are given. Firstly the current situation (IST) is researched in which the IHC Beaver is provided with one-year warranty at sale. Two important groups of stakeholders are the clients and the sub-suppliers. For the procurement of parts the role of the sub-suppliers is essential because they deliver over 60 % of the parts of the Beaver dredger. How agreements are made with sub-suppliers on the warranty period of the supplied parts is therefore essential when IHC has the intention to apply forward cooperation in the future. After the IST situation the ideal situation (SOLL) is defined. Forward cooperation can be achieved with different strategies; with the properties of the dredging market and the intention to achieve forward cooperation in the product life cycle of a standard industrial product, extended warranty has the best characteristics. Compared to the IST situation with base-warranty it is concluded that several uncertainties arise when extending the warranty with 5 years. The result of these uncertainties is that the usage and the reliability of the product cannot be predicted. This is a high risk for the supplier that will be translated in high warranty costs. In the perfect SOLL situation however most of the variables will become fixed, known or manageable. Resulting from the GAP analysis several actions that influence the warranty costs for the supplier are summarized; develop a new warranty policy, conduct a research into the product reliability and develop a method to control the product usage {{to reduce the risk of}} intensive or improper use. To implement forward cooperation this is what needs to be done; develop a structure where the variables ‘product reliability’ and ‘product usage’ determine the warranty costs and where the ‘warranty policy’ is the last variable to define the definitive ‘warranty costs’. Thereby the ‘warranty policy’ should also influence the ‘product usage’. With the knowledge of the literature and the case study the following changes are made to the original model of D. N. P. Murthy and W. R. Blischke (2006) to create the eventual framework; (i) the supplier is now considered an integrator; (ii) cooperation with the sub-suppliers (backwards cooperation) is included; (iii) the warranty policies control the warranty costs by in- or excluding parts, non- or renewing warranty and a possible decrease in the coverage of warranty costs for the integrator over time; (iv) the product usage is influenced by the warranty policy so that the usage risks are (more) controlled by the integrator. In the framework in figure 1 the warranty costs are completely dependent of the product performance, which in turn is determined by the product reliability and the product usage. To make a reliable estimation of the covered warranty costs it is of great importance that both the product reliability and the product usage are known. Furthermore the framework shows that the supplier of dredging equipment can rather be seen as an ‘integrator’ that relies on the products of sub-suppliers, therefore the supplier of dredging equipment needs to apply backward cooperation to achieve forward integration. To be able to influence the warranty costs the supplier of dredging equipment needs to offer several warranty policies that suit the product usage profile of the client. By providing different options the supplier is able to reduce the financial risks and the expected warranty costs. Before the supplier of dredging equipment is able to offer the extended warranty, it is highly recommended to take these actions that will form the basis for the extended warranty service; (1) start logging data on product usage and product reliability; (2) cooperate and negotiate with the sub-suppliers; (3) investigate the failure mode of all parts and systems; (4) determine the warranty cost (modelling); (5) define the warranty policies and apply these to determine the covered warranty costs. Only when these actions are undertaken extended warranty can be successfully implemented by the supplier of dredging equipment.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{two different}} {{markets in the}} shipping industry and describes what their possible future trends and demand are. Under the term 'multipurpose' can firstly be classified the traditional <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessel</b> (MPV) which is evolved from the tweendecker or the general cargo vessel. Secondly, there is the relatively new type of <b>multipurpose</b> support <b>vessel</b> (MSV) which is only serving the offshore industry. A description and a general background for both ship types is provided, and some supplementary issues such as deployment pattern for MPV and challenges for the MSV in the different segments of oil and gas, and wind energy were picked up and elaborated. A questionnaire {{was sent to the}} participants of the MPV market to find out about their outlook and which cargoes are relevant for the forecast. Future drivers are established in project cargo which has recorded an increase in recent years. Additionally, a SWOT analysis was undertaken for this ship type; it gives an overview over the internal and external factors of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and subsequently provides strategic options for deployment of a MPV. For the MSV market an interview was conducted, and a strong demand for this ship type coming from the offshore industry, especially from renewable energy generation was determined. As a conclusion of this study {{it can be seen that}} even though single purpose ships are dominant in the shipping industry, flexibility and versatility, either in cargo transport or in functionality, are still important and have their share in the maritime world.

The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the heavy landing craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too great and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The main concern is illegal tuna fishing by Japanese vessels.
