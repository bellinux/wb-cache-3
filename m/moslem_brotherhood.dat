According to Kuntzel, the Nazi Arabic radio service had a staff of 80 and broadcast every day in Arabic, stressing the similarities between Islam and Nazism and supported by the activities of the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husayni (who broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda from Berlin). The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian <b>Moslem</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.|$|E

According to their works, and ISIL itself, it unites two streams of Islamic thought that are the original <b>Moslem</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> and Salafism, though ISIL regards the modern <b>Moslem</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> and Hamas as traitors and apostates. [...] "We believe that jihad in God’s path is an individual obligation, from the fall of al-Andalus until the liberation of all Muslim lands, {{and it is an}} individual obligation {{in the presence of a}} pious person or an impious person." [...] British newspaper The Guardian defines the organisation's ideology as [...] "generally viewed as identical to al-Qaida’s or the Saudi version of Salafism - adherence to fundamental Islamic tenets." ...|$|E

After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws, Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active.... Before long political parties of the Nazi and Fascist type began to appear, complete with paramilitary youth organizations, colored shirts, strict discipline and more or less charismatic leaders.|$|E

The strugglebetween the Egyptian state’s forces {{of law and}} order led by President Mubarak, and militant islamicists belonging to Gama’a al-Islamiyya (the Islamic Group) has spread panic among Egypt’s tourist industry. Violent attacks on foreign visitors, including the death of a Briton in October 1992, has cost the country £ 490 million in lost revenue in 1983 alone. 1 Clashes between islamicists and the state following Mubarak’s call to ‘exterminate sedition in its cradle ’ has led to hundreds of deaths, thousands of arrests and the intensi-fication of authoritarian measures by heavily armed police and para-military to root out el-Gamaat supporters. These upheavals were aggravated by the October 1992 earthquake—the country’s worst ever recorded which took more than 350 lives and injured 4, 000. Those affected lived mainly in Cairo’s sub-standard and over-crowded slum areas. And it has been there that the <b>Moslem</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> has been busy mobilising support for an islamic state {{at the same time as}} providing social and economic help to the needy, offering services which the ailing Egyptian state can no longer provide...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMost {{observers of the}} Arab world point out that Islam has and is currently playing {{a significant role in}} the region's political life. In particular, the more fanatical, religiously based political movements have and are determining the internal stability of the Middle East and consequently affect the United States' political and economic position in the world. The success of the Iranian Islamic Revolution has dramatically underscored the United States' ignorance of the political impact of Islam. Not only has the revolution embarrassed the United States but it has also threatened the stability of those regimes which America currently depends upon economically and politically; specifically, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Given the political influence of Islam and the importance of Saudi Arabia to the United States, the question must be asked concerning Saudi Arabia's ability to withstand the current wave of Islamic revolutionary activity. Through an analysis of two previous politically influential Islamic Fundamentalist Movements in the Middle East; the <b>Moslem</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> of Egypt and the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Movement, as well as an in depth analysis of Saudi Arabian society and politics, this thesis will prove that Saudi Arabia cannot withstand the strains presented by Islamic fundamentalist activity. Specifically, it will confirm that certain, identifable socio-political phenomena exist in Saudi Arabia today that were common to both Egypt and Iran and ultimately will lead to a change in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, if not a dramatic upheaval in Saudi Arabian society and internal politics.
