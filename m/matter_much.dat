25|$|The main {{evidence}} used by {{the prosecution}} in the trial were over thirty years of poetry and prose written by Su Shi. This was collected from many of his associates, and printed editions from the market place were also considered. The analysis as to the meanings and implications of Su Shi's writings was not clear-cut, {{in terms of whether}} they were actually treasonous, or whether they were in the bounds of acceptable expression. Much of Su Shi's testimony revolved around these points, and what was said versus what he intended to imply, a <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> open to interpretation, much of it of an erudite nature, involving scholarly allusions, often obscure, dating back over a millennium and more of a continuous literary tradition.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras panda follows, {{with a few}} minor deviations, the {{standard}} model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild {{with the onset of}} the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire {{never managed}} to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a {{relatively}} easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It did nt <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> – Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C Trophy final.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Not only are [...] songs [...] absolutely crushing in a live setting, but the band is a fountain of bizarre, chaotic energy." [...] Describing vocalist Corey Taylor's performance, he said, [...] "Despite his manic energy [...] managed to keep his vocals tightly controlled, alternating between furious screaming and melodic passages". While reviewing their Toronto show on May 1, 2009 for CANOE, Jason MacNeil noted the absence of percussionist Crahan, although in noting that several other members would occasionally occupy the vacant drum kit, he added, [...] "It didn't seem to <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> to the fans." [...] He also said, [...] "For the most part, Slipknot kept the energy high" [...] and added that tracks like [...] "Dead Memories" [...] and [...] "Vermilion" [...] were the only moments [...] "which served as breathers."

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Born This Way" [...] {{was met with}} {{generally}} positive reception among music critics. James Montgomery of MTV praised the overall creationism concept of the music video, adding that it [...] "sort of makes sense, it sort of doesn't, but that 100 percent doesn't really <b>matter</b> <b>much.</b> This is Gaga at her most fabulous, her most out-there, her most, well, Gaga." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote that the fantasy aspects of the video is overshadowed by the overall spectacle, which he believed was analogous to Gaga, [...] "after thoroughly dominating this world with 'Born This Way,' [...] seems content to create brand-new worlds to tower over." [...] Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery, was extreme in the video. Raphael Chestang from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video, also complimenting the fashion. Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984), while believing it to be [...] "more of a high-fashion short film than a conventional music video". Jim Farber from New York Daily News wanted Gaga to add more humor in her videos, adding that although the video had [...] "joyous" [...] shock value, it definitely lacked creativity.|$|E

Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards Alec Baldwin's Jack in this episode, citing that he knows [...] "how to squeeze some serious funny out of a simple gesture and a pause." [...] She added that his [...] "lingering stare" [...] at both Jenna and Liz after taking their drink order [...] "was the funniest moment in a very funny episode". Ward also enjoyed that it [...] "brought us maximum Kenneth, which is great. He's turning {{out to be one of}} the show's most endearing characters." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the pairing of Jack and Kenneth was a [...] "great idea and gave Kenneth his best episode" [...] since [...] "Blind Date". In regards to Liz's story, he commented it was [...] "her strongest episodes to date", and said that it [...] "felt good" [...] to see her [...] "have a little luck for a change" [...] with [...] "The Head". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich disliked that NBC [...] "utterly ruined" [...] the outcome of Liz's plot in the promos, though, said that it was a [...] "very funny resolution to the relationship that was too good, and too well coiffed, to be true."

2500|$|The Summerhill {{classroom}} was popularly {{assumed to}} reflect Neill's anti-authoritarian beliefs, though their classes were traditional in practice. Neill {{did not show}} outward interest in classroom pedagogy, and was mainly interested in student happiness.

Leonard Waks wrote that, like Homer Lane, Neill thought all teaching should follow student interest, and that teaching method did not <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> once student interest was apparent. In a review of an algebra lesson taught by Neill as recounted through Herb Snitzer's Living at Summerhill, Richard Bailey described Neill's teaching technique as [...] "simply awful" [...] for his lack of student engagement, inarticulate explanations, and insults directed at students. Bailey criticized Neill's absolution of responsibility for his pupils' academic performance, and his view that charismatic instruction {{was a form of}} persuasion that weakened child autonomy.

2500|$|In governing, John always {{depended}} on strong auxiliaries. Prominent among these were Rodrigo de Sousa Coutinho, 1st Count of Linhares, António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca, and Tomás Antônio de Vila Nova Portugal, {{who may be}} considered the mentors of many of John's most important undertakings, but according to John Luccock: [...] "The prince regent has been various times accused of apathy; to me, {{he seemed to have}} greater sensitivity and strength of character than was generally attributed to him by both friends and opponents. He was placed in new circumstances by which he was tested, bowing before them with patience; if incited, he acted with vigor and promptness". He also praised the character of the king, reaffirming his kindness and attention. Oliveira Lima, with his classic Dom João VI no Brasil (1908), was one of the major figures responsible for the beginning of John's large-scale rehabilitation. He researched innumerable documents of the era without finding unfavorable descriptions of the king by Brazilians or by ambassadors and other diplomats accredited to the court. On the contrary, he found many accounts that painted him in favorable colors, such as the testimonies left by the British consul Henderson and the U.S. minister Sumter, who [...] "greatly preferred to address himself directly to the monarch, always willing to do justice, than to confer with his ministers.... deeming him in this <b>matter</b> <b>much</b> more advanced than his courtiers". Diplomatic documents also confirm the breadth of his political vision, aiming to give Brazil an importance in the Americas comparable to the United States, adopting a discourse similar the U.S. doctrine of Manifest Destiny. He asserted his authority without violence, more in a persuasive and affable manner; his conduct of international affairs, although sometimes unsuccessful and somewhat given to imperialist ambitions, in many other ways was far-seeing and harmonious,as indicated by the many actions described above that improved the living conditions of the Brazilian colony.|$|E
