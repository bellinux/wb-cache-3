5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisement</b> {{to anyone who}} could {{demonstrate}} a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisement.</b> The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the portrayal of}} women in Nigerian <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements,</b> with the aim to investigate whether there is sexualization {{of women in the}} advertisements. To achieve this aim, content analyses of 61 <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> from 5 different categories of magazines; a general interest magazine (Genevieve), fashion magazine (Hints Complete Fashion), men’s magazine (Mode), women’s magazine (Totally Whole) and a relationship magazine (Forever) were carried out. Erving Goffman’s 1979 frame analysis and Kang’s two additional coding categories were used to investigate the sexualization of women. Findings show that women are used for decorative purposes and objectified in over 70 per cent of the advertisements analyzed. Also, there is sexualization of women in <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> because women are nude 57. 4 percent of the <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements...</b>|$|R

She, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble) {{arrive at the}} scene, where they determine that the deceased were electrocuted before the impact, and that the elevator did not fall, but drove down. Furthermore, Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area. Meanwhile, Meegar inadvertently causes a packaging machine to malfunction, severely injuring his boss right after Meegar is fired. He later reveals to his mother that some time ago he answered a <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisement</b> promising to [...] "unlock [...] hidden potential", and although he has no knowledge {{of what has been}} done to him, he believes that what he has done was a result of being experimented on. A further panicked Meegar then causes his mother's pacemaker to fail, and she dies.|$|E
40|$|It {{has taken}} {{advertisers}} {{many years to}} develop integrated advertising communication strategies that could incorporate many or all traditional marketing communication channels that developed separately, such as billboards, magazine advertising, television and radio. All of the marketing communication channels were usually integrated {{with one another in}} order to produce messages that were comprehensive as well as unified across all of these channels. However, the rapid development and growth of Internet communications resulted in the need to review traditional approaches towards advertising to accommodate the new communication medium. Initially (in the late 1990 s) there appeared {{to be a lot of}} confusion about the role Internet communications were to play in advertising campaigns and whether they were destined to supplement traditional marketing communications or to replace them. It was also not clear how to combine interactive communications with non-interactive ones. The thesis investigated and compared content of both traditional (<b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements)</b> and emerging (websites) advertising communications in Australia at the turn of the century. The focus of this investigation was on the identification of the informational content of <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> and websites as well as the degree of integration between these two marketing communication channels. The thesis addressed arguably two of the most critical (if not the most critical) areas of marketing communications of the time: informational effectiveness and identification of key informational content elements in both <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> and websites as well as integration between <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> and website marketing communications during the early days of the Internet marketing. Informational content analysis of <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> and websites identified a number of content-related differences between the two types of marketing communications. It also revealed that content of web-linked <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> was likely to differ from the content of <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> that did not include a link to a website...|$|R

Roosevelt gave Burton a letter praising the exhibit, which Burton in turn published by facsimile in a <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisement</b> for the sale of stock in the exhibit. The White House received a letter from the magazine inquiring into the authenticity of the letter {{on the same day that}} Mulvane returned for a second meeting to press Smith's appointment. Roosevelt was enraged, demanded the return of the letter, and declared that [...] "from now on Burton would be considered politically a Democratic Senator, as far as patronage is concerned."

This 30-minute weekly show aired in many Spanish-speaking countries until the early 1970s. In 1972, Montalbán co-founded the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minority Committee with actors Carmen Zapata, Henry Darrow and Edith Diaz. In 1975, he was chosen as the television spokesman for the new Chrysler Cordoba. The car became a successful model, and over the following several years, was heavily advertised; his mellifluous delivery of a line praising the [...] "soft Corinthian leather" [...] upholstery of the car's interior, often misquoted as [...] "fine" [...] or [...] "rich Corinthian leather" [...] (he did describe the leather as [...] "rich" [...] for later ads for the Chrysler New Yorker), became famous and was much parodied, and Montalbán subsequently became a favorite subject of impersonators. For example, Eugene Levy frequently impersonated him on SCTV. In 1986, he was featured in a <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisement</b> for the new Chrysler New Yorker.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Journalism and Mass CommunicationsXiaochen A. ZhangMost of {{the models}} in Chinese fashion <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> are Caucasian women today. White skin, {{as one of their}} Caucasian characteristics, is {{particularly}} emphasized. Millions of Chinese women are bombarded with the advertising’s message of “having white skin is beautiful” every day. My research suggests that this kind of adverting depicts white skin as a beauty ideal; the prevalence of Caucasian models in whitening products’ <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> constructs body-esteem, self-esteem, and purchase decision-making of Chinese women. The Social Judgment Theory is employed in this research as a theoretical framework. It is a way to explain when persuasive messages are most likely to succeed and how people make judgments about them. Understanding this phenomenon will ultimately provide insight into addressing the effects of the promotion of fashion <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> on Chinese women. It is further anticipated that future researchers will expand and improve the knowledge of the Chinese advertising market...|$|R
40|$|This article {{intended}} {{to illustrate a}} profile of the role and impact of English in magazine print advertising in Iran, by examining the quantitative results obtained from discourse analysis. Three issues of Khanevadeh Sabz and two issues of Zendegi Ideal were collected and a total of 261 advertisements were analyzed. Results indicated that English has consistently been utilized in Persian <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements,</b> representing attention-getting, persuasion, international brands, prestige, modernity, globalization, premium quality, fun, innovation and creativity. However, using English in Persian <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> is culturally and linguistically constrained. Culturally, in advertising traditional products English is only employed to introduce the name and e-mail address. Linguistically, although some English written slogans in Persian magazines had puns in them; the English used in Persian <b>magazine</b> <b>advertisements</b> mostly consists of easy-to-read vocabulary. Overall, in spite of the public’s generally low proficiency in English, it is predicted that English mixing will continue to thrive in magazine advertising discourse in Iran...|$|R
