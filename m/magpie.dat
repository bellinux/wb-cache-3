5|$|The Australian <b>magpie</b> was {{subdivided}} into three {{species in the}} literature {{for much of the}} twentieth century—the black-backed <b>magpie</b> (G. tibicen), the white-backed <b>magpie</b> (G. hypoleuca), and the western <b>magpie</b> (G. dorsalis). They were later noted to hybridise readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969, with most recent authors following suit.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} piping shrike, the white-backed <b>magpie</b> was {{declared}} the official {{emblem of the}} Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The <b>magpie</b> is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the <b>magpie</b> from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt {{the black and white}} colours and <b>Magpie</b> name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies, and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the <b>magpie</b> emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail will defend its nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, much like the Australian <b>magpie.</b> While attacks from willie wagtails are not as common or as formidable as the <b>magpie,</b> they do come as a great shock to recipients.|$|E
40|$|<b>Magpies</b> (Pica pica and P. nuttalli) {{have lived}} in close {{association}} with humans for centuries. <b>Magpies</b> are found in western North America. <b>Magpies</b> {{are associated with the}} dry, cool climatic regions of North America. <b>Magpies</b> are omnivorous and very opportunistic, a characteristic typical of other corvids. <b>Magpies,</b> like other corvids, are intelligent birds. <b>Magpies</b> have come into conflict with humans in North America for quite some time. <b>Magpies</b> are protected as migratory nongame birds under the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act...|$|R

50|$|Leo Trevena played {{four seasons}} with the Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> between 1950-1953. He played halfback in the 1950 <b>Magpies</b> team that were runners up in the premiership. He won a premiership with the <b>Magpies</b> in 1952 NSWRFL season.|$|R
5|$|Common names include black currawong, sooty currawong, black bell-magpie, {{black or}} {{mountain}} <b>magpie,</b> black or sooty crow-shrike, and muttonbird. Black jay {{is a local}} name applied to the species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of the grey currawong (S.versicolor), known as the clinking currawong or hill <b>magpie.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a rural road, and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The <b>Magpie</b> (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The <b>Magpie</b> is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The <b>Magpie</b> is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop {{at the back}} of the head; therefore, keeping the <b>magpie</b> in sight at all times can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the back of the head may fool the <b>magpie</b> as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 the Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> Under 20's {{team were}} runners {{up to the}} Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs, captained by Mitch Zammit and Luke Duffy. The Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> last title was won in 2002 when the Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> captained by Liam Fulton won the New South Wales Rugby League Under 18's competition.|$|R

5|$|On the ground, the Australian <b>magpie</b> {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The <b>magpie</b> has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Castafiore {{leaves for}} Milan {{to perform in}} the opera La gazza ladra (Italian: The Thieving <b>Magpie).</b> Tintin realises that the true culprit {{responsible}} for the theft of the emerald and the scissors is a <b>magpie.</b> He explains to Haddock that the scissors must have fallen out of the nest only to be found by Miarka. Tintin retrieves the emerald {{and hands it to}} Thomson and Thompson to return to Castafiore. The stonemason mends the broken step, only for Haddock to step on it again.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} high ambient {{temperatures}} on the behaviour of <b>Magpies</b> (Pica pica) was assessed in northern Cyprus, which marks the southern limit of their European range. <b>Magpies</b> actively selected their thermal environment when temperatures rose above 31 C, by retreating to shaded areas. On {{days when the}} temperature was higher, <b>Magpies</b> appeared {{to spend more time}} perched in the shade and less time foraging. Flying and foraging activities were generally restricted to cooler parts of the day. <b>Magpies</b> were rarely seen panting or drinking and gular fluttering was not observed. We suggest that utilisation of shade is important for <b>Magpies</b> to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to remain common at the southern limit of their range despite experiencing high temperatures...|$|R

5|$|Magpies {{have a long}} {{breeding}} season which varies {{in different parts of}} the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the <b>magpie.</b> The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a <b>magpie</b> nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the <b>magpie</b> nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the <b>magpie</b> nestlings.|$|E
50|$|The Asquith <b>Magpies</b> returned, {{replacing}} the St Johns Eagles. The Guildford Owls made their return, and the Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> made their return following {{the merger of}} the NSW Cup entities.|$|R

5|$|As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob {{and chase}} larger {{species such as}} the Australian <b>magpie</b> (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds and currawongs, the black-faced cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae), the olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), crows and ravens, the {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) and even small raptors like the collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus).|$|E
5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The <b>Magpie</b> as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magpies</b> of {{the genus}} Pica are {{generally}} found in temperate regions of Europe, Asia and western North America, with populations also present in Tibet and high elevation areas of India, i.e. Ladakh (Kargil and Leh) and Pakistan. <b>Magpies</b> {{of the genus}} Cyanopica are found in East Asia and also the Iberian peninsula. Birds called <b>magpies</b> but not actually related {{may be found in}} Australia.|$|R
50|$|A Canterbury junior, Frank Sponberg {{played for}} the Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> for three seasons between 1932-1934. He played lock in the 1934 Grand Final winning Western Suburbs <b>Magpies</b> team as a late inclusion.|$|R
50|$|When Lewis and Clark first {{encountered}} <b>magpies</b> in 1804 in South Dakota, they reported the birds {{as being very}} bold, entering tents or taking food from the hand. <b>Magpies</b> formerly followed American bison herds (from which they gleaned ticks and insects), {{as well as the}} bands of Plains Indians that hunted the bison so they could scavenge carcasses. When the bison herds were devastated in the 1870s, <b>magpies</b> switched to cattle, and by the 1960s they had also moved into the emerging towns and cities of the North American West. Today black-billed <b>magpies</b> remain relatively tame in areas where they are not persecuted. However, they become very wary in areas where they are often shot at or disturbed. Especially {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, black-billed <b>magpies</b> were considered detrimental to game-bird populations (they sometimes steal bird eggs) and domestic stock (they sometimes peck at sores on cattle), and were systematically trapped or shot. Bounties of one cent per egg or two cents per head were offered in many states. In Idaho the death toll eventually amounted to an estimated 150,000. In 1933, 1,033 <b>magpies</b> were shot in Washington’s Okanogan valley by two teams of bounty hunters. Many <b>magpies</b> also died from eating poison set out for coyotes and other predators.|$|R
5|$|The Australian <b>magpie</b> prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian <b>magpie</b> has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
5|$|The family {{contains}} a single species, the <b>Magpie</b> goose. It {{was an early}} and distinctive offshoot of the anseriform family tree, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans, sometime in the late Cretaceous. The single species is a vagrant to Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{secondary}} {{host of the}} parasitic great spotted cuckoo, the European <b>magpie</b> being the preferred host. However, {{in areas where the}} latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E
