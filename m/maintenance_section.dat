5|$|The wing {{converted}} from Sabres to Mirages between 1964 and 1966, commencing with No.2 OCU and concluding with No.76 Squadron; the last-mentioned disbanded in 1973. No.81 Wing itself disbanded at Williamtown in December 1966. No.75 Squadron was based at RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, from 1967 until 1983, when it relocated to Darwin. Following conversion to the F/A-18 Hornet in 1988, it transferred to Tindal. Owing to its remote location, {{it became the}} largest Hornet squadron, employing an extensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>section</b> to ensure readiness.|$|E

The 1-Click <b>Maintenance</b> <b>section</b> runs multiple routine maintenance tools at once. The Performance Optimizer and Fix Problems utilities {{are intended to}} provide tips to identify and fix potential problems and increase performance, such as disabling unnecessary visual effects and disabling or removing unused Windows services and programs. Live Optimization, according to the application's author, is intended to improve the responsiveness of Windows applications by tweaking their execution priorities.|$|E
25|$|Companies A, B, C, and D â€“ {{the tank}} line companies, both medium and light, all {{followed}} the same table of organization. Each company consisted of a headquarters section which, along with a small headquarters staff, also included two tanks (one for the company commander {{and one for the}} executive officer); and three five-tank platoons. The medium tank companies were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while the light tank company was equipped with M5 Stuart tanks. All four companies had their own <b>maintenance</b> <b>section,</b> which included an M32 Tank Recovery Vehicle, built on a Sherman chassis. Because the Stuart carried a 4-man crew versus a 5-man crew on the Sherman, it had a somewhat smaller personnel strength than the medium tank companies. For the Normandy landings, Companies B and C were equipped with DD tanks. As virtually all these tanks were lost during the assault on D-Day, they were replaced with conventional M4 Shermans as soon as the battalion began receiving replacement equipment.|$|E
40|$|Benchmarking is an {{established}} method of working {{which is often}} used {{in order to develop}} the quality of the organization. However, almost 70 % of the organizations with benchmarking fail {{due to the lack of}} planning and structuring of the benchmarking exercise. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>sections</b> in the paper and pulp industry are one of those who have decided to conduct benchmarking. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to gain knowledge of how the <b>maintenance</b> <b>sections</b> in the paper and pulp industry deliberately structure and plan to use benchmarking as a driving force for quality development in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>sections.</b> The study is a hermeneutic case study. Telephone interviews and document analysis have been used as data acquisition methods. The results show that there is a lack of both planning and structuring in the benchmarking process, and lack of management commitment for quality improvements within industrial maintenance. Based on the results of the study, discussions and reflections have been made The discussions and reflections are about how the case organization can increase its prospects for the use of benchmarking as a driving force in quality improvement of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>sections,</b> where the committee work plays an essential support in the benchmarking process...|$|R

500|$|No. 37 Squadron is {{currently}} tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. It {{is located at}} RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, and controlled by No.84 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. As of July 2013, the squadron comprised over 400 personnel organised into four flights of aircrew, an administrative and operational section, and a <b>maintenance</b> <b>section</b> responsible for day-to-day aircraft servicing as well as regular maintenance cycles of six weeks' duration.

500|$|The 390th Air Service Group {{was created}} as the command echelon for the 603rd Air Engineering Squadron, the 1027th Air Material Squadron, {{and its own}} Headquarters and Base Services Squadron, but when these units became {{independent}} operationally, it acted as the basic support unit for the entire 509th Composite Group in providing quarters, rations, medical care, postal service and other functions. The 603rd Air Engineering Squadron was unique in that it provided depot-level B-29 maintenance in the field, obviating the necessity of sending aircraft back to the United States for major repairs.
