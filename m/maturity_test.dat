40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} near-patient and laboratory-based fetal lung <b>maturity</b> <b>tests</b> in predicting the need for neonatal ventilation. Design. A prospective descriptive study. Subjects. One hundred high-risk obstetric patients where confirmation of fetal lung maturity would initiate delivery. Methods. Fetal weight estimation, placental maturity grading, and amniocentesis were performed. The investigators examirted the amniotic fluid visually, and performed the tap test and shake test. Laboratory technicians estimated the lecithin-sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio, determined {{the presence of a}} phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) band on gel electrophoresis, and the optical density at 650 nm. Neonates delivered within 1 week of amniocentesis were included in the analysis. The primary end-point was the ability of the lung <b>maturity</b> <b>tests</b> to predict the need for neonatal ventilation. Results. Twelve of 100 neonates required ventilation. The tap test and optical density (OD) shift at 650 nm predicted the need for neonatal ventilation with the greatest accuracy. Conclusion. The tap test is a rapid, easy and accurate predictor of the need for neonatal ventilation. The OD shift at 650 nm is the laboratory-based test with the greatest accuracy in our setting.

30|$|Environmental impacts {{are high}} {{because of the}} absence of the {{impermeability}} of the composting plant. Leachates (especially during the rainy season) can infiltrate the sandy soil and be considered as a potential pollutant of the ground water. Concerning the process handling, management of the residues is very organized to the extent of enabling a rapid workflow, consequently processing the maximum residues per year. Regarding the mechanization, there is a heterogeneity in the perception. The composting plants that turn tomato and citrus residues are more mechanized than the others that compost sheep and olive mill wastes. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that tomato and citrus residues are more important in volumes and hence need more mechanization. Quality of the compost is the most important criterion for this assessment, but could be at odds with the qualitative test mentioned above. The quality of compost in this assessment refers to the physical and chemical parameters (agronomic parameters), whilst the <b>maturity</b> <b>test</b> refers to the degree of humification of the organic matter. High levels of TOC require a long maturation phase to allow proper humification.|$|E

In addition, the calculated values of concrete maturity for outdoor specimens, obtained using the power function, agree well with the measured values.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to validate a non-invasive fetal lung <b>maturity</b> <b>test</b> by counting lamellar bodies from a vaginal pool among women with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Methods In a prospective study, amniotic fluid specimens were collected from a vaginal pool from women after preterm premature rupture of membranes with gestational age between 27 and 36 completed weeks. Receiver operating characteristics curve was estimated to assess the threshold of lamellar bodies' count that may predict fetal lung maturity. Results Seventy-five specimens were collected of which 17 were between 32 to 34 weeks. A lamellar bodies' count of 28, 000 or more predicted mature fetus 100 % of the time (specificity) among all women and also among women between 32 to 34 weeks. The sensitivity was 72 % among all and 92 % when gestational age was between 32 to 34 weeks.

Biological transformation of yard waste instead of its landfilling is not only a promising solution to overcome growing problems of solid waste management, but also reduces air and water pollution. In-vessel composting of yard waste instead of its windrow or aerated pile composting in Cameron Highlands, where the lands are in great demand, is an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for solid waste management.|$|R

The field tests were conducted in three environments in 2009 (Knoxville, TN; Harrisburg, IL; and Stuttgart, AR).
