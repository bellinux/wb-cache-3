30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of a selective secondary protective control strategy proposed to maximize the likelihood of recovery from <b>misoperations</b> of the existing (primary) protection in a power system. A scalable stochastic discrete-state model is established, taking into consideration of the processes of protection <b>misoperations</b> and their mitigations. Such <b>misoperations</b> have been a main culprit of cascading failures in modern power systems. The likelihood of recovery from protection <b>misoperations</b> is quantified {{by a set of}} security indices that formally incorporate the uncertain knowledge of the continuous-state of rotor angles/speed deviations of synchronous generators and that of the discrete-state of equipment faults and primary protection <b>misoperations.</b> The proposed secondary protection leverages on the ever more available time-synchronized samples of networked sensors for diagnosis and fault-tolerant control to cost effectively improving power system reliability without altering the existing protection system. The technology readiness for implementing the secondary protective control is examined through a three-area test system.|$|R
30|$|Relays {{are vital}} devices present in any power system. They protect various {{components}} in the power system from catastrophic damage during faults. They help in maintaining {{safe and reliable operation}} of the entire system. A recent study analyzing protection system <b>misoperations</b> was performed by North Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and they identified various causes for relay <b>misoperations</b> [1]. All these emphasize the need to make comprehensive assessment of relay operation and its performance regularly.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to analyze the impact of {{protection}} <b>misoperations</b> [3, 4, 5], {{to prevent them from}} occurring through adaptive relaying [4], and to deploy remedial action schemes for some specific scenarios [6], fundamental study on systematic recovery from false trips upon an equipment fault remains an uncharted territory. Recovery from protection <b>misoperations</b> presents a significant challenge, given the absence of a formal mathematical representation for false trips and recovery processes, as the traditional reliability model typically only captures equipment failure and system restoration processes. The challenge also stems from the fraction-of-a-second fast response time required of protection functions.|$|R

30|$|As new sensing {{and control}} devices {{continue}} {{to enter the}} grid, consideration to mitigate protection <b>misoperations</b> should be incorporated into device placement criteria involving {{the dynamics of the}} electric network [39], and the average sensor data availability [40]. Finally, the maximally secure mitigation strategy of protection <b>misoperations</b> can be regarded as a special solution of a Markov decision problem [24, 41] where a greedy policy is sought {{in the sense that it}} focuses on the immediate security concern. It would be desirable to investigate whether the generalization to a longer time horizon policy involving a sequence of high rate transitions, from state f to m to d, for example, could lead to a mitigation strategy that better benefits the power system reliability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Relay <b>misoperations</b> play an {{important}} role in cascading blackouts. Power swing and out-of-step conditions caused by large disturbances in the system may result in relay <b>misoperations.</b> This effect is analyzed and simulated in this paper. Synchronized sampling based fault location (SSFL) algorithm was proposed as part of an advanced fault analysis tool to give precise fault information and verify relay judgments. This paper further analyzes the algorithm under power swing and out-ofstep conditions and tests it by both static and dynamic scenarios generated in ATP. The test results indicate that SSFL algorithm performs better than distance relay under power swing and outof-step conditions and can be used as a robust fault analysis tool for practical use.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{large scale}} system blackouts involve relay <b>misoperations.</b> Traditional relay {{algorithms}} and settings {{need to be}} evaluated {{under a variety of}} fault and no-fault system-wide scenarios to better understand the causes for <b>misoperations.</b> New fault diagnosis algorithms also need to be developed to assure improved relaying performance and then evaluated under various scenarios. This paper introduces advanced fault analysis simulation software based on the interactive MATLAB and ATP simulation. The software consists of two major parts, power system simulation and relay algorithm evaluation. The former part can automatically generate thousands of system-wide events at one time and extract the transients for fault studies.

30|$|Protection <b>misoperations</b> {{in power}} systems are a top {{reliability}} concern {{according to a}} recent state of reliability report of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) [1]. Protection <b>misoperations</b> fall into two broad categories: failures to trip and false trips, where trip means the removal of a piece of supposedly faulty equipment from the system by opening some circuit breakers. Equipment faults considered in this paper are three-phase short to ground faults in transmission lines. The principles established, however, are applicable to other types of transmission line faults and faults in other types of equipment. A typical protection system is designed to be dependable (to trip whenever it should) at the expense of security (not to trip whenever it should not) [2]. False trips occur much more often than failures to trip in a stressed system [1]. False trips are sometimes referred to as hidden failures. A hidden failure is a permanent defect causing the incorrect removal of a circuit element as a direct consequence of another triggering event [3]. A system can become stressed when it is subject to an equipment fault, a switch, a change in load/generation power, or a severe event of nature.|$|R

Incorrect short-circuit model parameters can lead to erroneous relay settings and relay <b>misoperations,</b> an example of which is described in [5]. As a result, {{it is essential that}} the circuit parameters are accurately known and the system model is continually updated to reflect any system additions, repairs, or modifications.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{capabilities}} of reliable computations in one-dimensional cellular automata are investigated {{by means of}} the Early Bird Problem. The problem is typical for situations in massively parallel systems where a global behavior must be achieved by only local interactions between the single elements. The cells that cause the <b>misoperations</b> are assumed to behave as follows. They run a self-diagnosis before the actual computation once. The result is stored locally such that the working state of a cell becomes visible to its neighbors. A non-working (defective) cell cannot modify information but is able to transmit it unchanged with unit speed. We present an O(n log(n) log(n)) -time fault-tolerant solution of the Early Bird Problem. key words: cellular automata, fault tolerance, early bird problem, parallel algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{strategy}} at the local (substation) level, aimed at preventing or mitigating the cascading blackouts that involve relay <b>misoperations</b> or inadequate local diagnostic support. The strategy consists of an advanced real-time tool that combines neural network based fault detection and classification (NNFDC) algorithm and synchronized sampling based fault location (SSFL) algorithm with a relay monitoring tool using event tree analysis (ETA). The fault analysis tool provides a reference for conventional distance relay with its better performance and the relay monitoring tool provides detailed local information about the disturbances. The idea of the entire strategy is to meet several NERC recommendations to prevent blackouts using wide area protection and control.
