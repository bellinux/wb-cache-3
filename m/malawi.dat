5|$|In 1961, Banda's <b>Malawi</b> Congress Party (MCP) {{gained a}} {{majority}} in the Legislative Council elections and Banda became Prime Minister in 1963. The Federation was dissolved in 1963, and on 6 July 1964, Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself <b>Malawi.</b> Under a new constitution, <b>Malawi</b> became a republic with Banda as its first president. The new document also formally made <b>Malawi</b> a one-party state with the MCP as the only legal party. In 1971, Banda was declared president-for-life. For almost 30 years, Banda presided over a rigidly authoritarian regime, which ensured that <b>Malawi</b> did not suffer armed conflict. Opposition parties, including the <b>Malawi</b> Freedom Movement of Orton Chirwa and the Socialist League of <b>Malawi,</b> were founded in exile.|$|E

5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} <b>Malawi,</b> certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In <b>Malawi,</b> HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in <b>Malawi.</b> In addition, women in <b>Malawi</b> {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in <b>Malawi</b> has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E

The <b>Malawi</b> army originated from British colonial units formed before independence, and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment. The <b>Malawi</b> Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates {{a small number of}} transport aircraft and multi-purpose helicopters.

5|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in <b>Malawi</b> {{has been characterized}} by drastic declines {{in the number of}} health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in <b>Malawi</b> are related to HIV/AIDS. However, <b>Malawi</b> currently faces a significant deficit in human resources: only 159 doctors were practicing in <b>Malawi</b> in 2007. The World Health Organization's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities fail to meet this standard.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, Chewa was {{the largest}} {{community}} in the region with 39.7 per cent population and Chewa was the widely spoken language in Eastern province with 34.6 per cent speaking it. The province was claimed {{as a part of}} <b>Malawi</b> in 1968 by the then Malawian President Dr. Hastings Kamazu Banda who was a supporter of the apartheid in South Africa against the wishes of Organization of African Unity (OAU). The then Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda openly asked <b>Malawi</b> to go on war with Zambia to claim the province and also affirmed that Zambia would not have trade relations with <b>Malawi</b> until the claim on territory was withdrawn. The expansionist ambition of <b>Malawi</b> was discontinued and the Eastern Province remained with Zambia.|$|E
5|$|Cassava {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and <b>Malawi.</b> In Ghana, cassava chips are called konkonte. Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana.

5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from <b>Malawi</b> travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in <b>Malawi.</b> <b>Malawi</b> maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between <b>Malawi</b> and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, <b>Malawi</b> established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between <b>Malawi</b> and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to <b>Malawi</b> criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from <b>Malawi,</b> and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E

5|$|In addition, some {{setbacks}} {{have been}} experienced, and <b>Malawi</b> has {{lost some of}} its ability to pay for imports due to a general shortage of foreign exchange, as investment fell 23% in 2009. There are many investment barriers in <b>Malawi,</b> which the government has failed to address, including high service costs and poor infrastructure for power, water, and telecommunications. , it was estimated that <b>Malawi</b> had a GDP (purchasing power parity) of $12.81billion, with a per capita GDP of $900, and inflation estimated at around 8.5% in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in <b>Malawi.</b> The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising <b>Malawi,</b> a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in <b>Malawi,</b> and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising <b>Malawi</b> also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in <b>Malawi.</b>|$|E
