The country's {{participation}} at London marked its tenth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included three track and field athletes; Tsepo Ramonene, Mosito Lehata and Mamorallo Tjoka, and one swimmer; Masempe Theko. Ramonene and Lehata qualified for the Games by meeting qualification standards, while Tjoka and Theko made the Olympics through wildcard places. Tjoka {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Lehata held it at the closing ceremony. Ramonene finished last in the men's marathon and was revived <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> personnel during the event. Lehata did not progress to the semi-finals of the men's 200 metres and Tjoka finished in 90th in the women's marathon. Theko finished 73rd (and last) overall in the women's 50 metre freestyle and did not progress to the semi-finals of the event.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer hard court season Radwańska pulled out of the Bank of the West Classic, due to an injured right hand. She caught an injury to her right hand during the {{marathon}} third set in the fourth round of the Wimbledon Championships against Cibulkova. “Unfortunately the right hand injury I suffered at Wimbledon is not 100 percent (fine) and <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> team has advised me to rest,” said Radwańska. She, however, was able to get back in shape before Rogers Cup in Montreal. At Rogers Cup, she defeated Monica Niculescu in straight sets before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi human experimentation on prisoners during World War II, which were declared at the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials to be [...] "crimes against humanity", the World Medical Association developed the Declaration of Geneva to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state [...] " [...] will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> knowledge contrary {{to the laws of}} humanity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{began taking}} shape {{towards the end}} of the hiatus. Burnley stated that after growing {{frustrated}} with the lack of answers concerning his health condition, he decided to focus on writing music, saying on That Metal Show, [...] "I literally took <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> records [...] and I slammed them down like, 'You know what, forget this, I'm not getting anywhere with this', so I just decided to stop trying to find out whatever it was and just focus on our music, and that's when Dark Before Dawn really started to take shape." [...] After the album was mostly written, Burnley began assembling new members of the band, including Jasen Rauch (lead guitar; originally from Red), Keith Wallen (rhythm guitar and backing vocals; originally from Adelitas Way), Aaron Bruch (bass), and Shaun Foist (drums; originally from Picture Me Broken).|$|E
2500|$|A fifth edition was {{published}} in 1976 (...) and is {{generally considered to be}} the definitive culmination of Cleckley's work. The preface does not specify the changes made. Unlike the first edition it states: [...] "Dr. Corbett H. Thigpen, <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> associate of many years, has played a major part in the development and the revision of this work." [...] Cleckley also states that it could not have been written without the assistance and contributions of Thigpen's wife and his own (first), both called Louise. A sixth edition {{was published}} shortly after Cleckley's death in 1984, but is described by others as having minimal substantive changes. Several further years after Cleckley's death, another fifth edition (...) was released for non-profit educational use by Emily S. Cleckley, his second wife, naming her as well as Hervey M. Cleckley and copyrighted 1988 to her rather than Mosby as for all prior initial releases (which have been repeat published in various different years).|$|E

60|$|What I {{suffer in}} that way no tongue can tell. From my {{earliest}} infancy I have been a martyr to it. As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for a day. They did not know, then, that it was <b>my</b> liver. <b>Medical</b> science was in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down to laziness.|$|R
60|$|What I {{want to know}} {{is whether}} your art (or {{whatever}} you call it) can get at my diseased mind, through my healthy body. You have more than once told me that medicine can do this. The time has come for doing it. I am in a bad way, and a bad end may follow. <b>My</b> only <b>medical</b> friend, deliver me from myself.|$|R
60|$|The {{truth is}} that I have not taken the doctor into my confidence. There are two causes for those signs of {{exhaustion}} which have surprised <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> attendant--and the names of them are--Anxiety and Suspense.|$|E

6000|$|... "As to {{the latter}} part, I have no means of {{checking}} you," [...] said I, [...] "but at least {{it is not difficult}} to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career."

5000|$|In <b>my</b> opinion <b>medical</b> stations, schools, libraries, pharmacies, under {{existing}} conditions, {{only lead}} to slavery.

Nothing of the sort! <b>My</b> regular <b>medical</b> practice had broken down under me. Very well--I tried my luck as a quack. In plain English, I invented a patent medicine. The one thing wanting was money enough to advertise it. False friends buttoned up their pockets. You see?" ...|$|R

6000|$|I was {{too weak}} to contest the matter; I obeyed. <b>My</b> <b>medical</b> {{attendant}} nodded across the bed to my mother, and said, [...] "Now, he'll do." [...] My mother had some compassion on me. She relieved my anxiety in these plain words: ...|$|E

40|$|Elvio Baccarini {{has responded}} generously to <b>my</b> book <b>Medical</b> Ethics: Ordinary Concepts, Ordinary Lives (2008), but I {{would like to}} respond to three of his criticisms: first, about the role that theory ought to play in, and in {{relation}} to, moral experience; second, about my defence of a doctor’s right to conscientiously object to performing legal abortions; and third, to the reality of posthumous harm. Baccarini claims that I have overstated my claims, and drawn illegitimate metaphysical conclusions from people’s ordinary language. However, I argue that moral language is special precisely because of the way it expresses an irreducible personal perspective...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{might ask}} you," [...] she persisted, [...] "to {{allow me to}} mind my own business. But I am {{incapable}} of making an ungrateful return for the interest which you take in <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> welfare. Let me venture to ask if you {{understand the value of}} time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will be serious--serious enough. I {{can afford}} to be so, as I have {{received}} <b>my</b> <b>medical</b> passport for to-morrow. No girl, you say, ought to be out of my reach. If the girl were one Miss Staveley, should she be regarded as out of my reach?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My uncle {{came to see}} me. He was so alarmed that {{he insisted}} on a {{consultation}} being held with his own physician. Another great authority was called in, at the same time, by the urgent request of <b>my</b> own <b>medical</b> man. These distinguished persons held more than one privy council, before they would consent to give a positive opinion. It was an evasive opinion (encumbered with hard words of Greek and Roman origin) when it was at last pronounced. I waited until they had taken their leave, and then appealed to my own doctor. [...] "What do these men really think?" [...] I asked. [...] "Shall I live, or die?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} Johnnyboy afterwards forgave my moral defection, he did {{not seem}} to have forgotten <b>my</b> practical <b>medical</b> ministration, and our brief interview had a surprising result. From that moment he confounded his parents and doctors by resolutely and positively refusing to take any more of their pills, tonics, or drops. Whether from a sense of loyalty to me, or whether he was not yet convinced of the efficacy of homoeopathy, {{he did not}} suggest a substitute, declare his preferences, or even give his reasons, but firmly and peremptorily declined his present treatment. And, to everybody's astonishment, {{he did not seem}} a bit the worse for it.|$|R
40|$|Arecent minor {{encounter}} with <b>my</b> local <b>medical</b> system produced the following flurry of mail: I received bills from the doctor, the medical lab, the hospital, the specialist, and another bill from the hospital, then a refund from the doctor, a form to verify a procedure (which was disallowed, {{in spite of}} prior assurances from the doctor), and another bill as reimbursement for the procedure that was no longer covered by insurance.
