50|$|On 15 July 1944, while {{returning}} in {{a severely}} damaged airplane (B-17G, 840th BS, 483rd BG,15th AF, Sterparone, Italy) {{on a mission}} to an important enemy oil refinery in Ploesti, Captain Leo C. Brooks Point, June 1943 was forced to bail out over Yugoslavia Serbia. Immediately on landing he was approached by members of the Chetnik army who offered him assistance. At Captain Brooks' request to see their commanding officer (Kapetan Larko Muzikravic), he was led through the mountains for several days until on 26 July 1944 he reached a British landing strip (Pranjani, Serbia) that had been prepared for the evacuation of escapees. In the villages surrounding this field there were already some 150 American airmen who were awaiting an expected evacuation and more were coming in every day. As the ranking American officer he took command of the Americans present and in conjunction with the Chetnik area commander determined the best policy to follow in quartering and protecting the men and in effecting a high degree of camouflage discipline. Due to his careful planning, tact, and diplomacy, Captain Brooks obtained <b>maximum</b> <b>aid</b> and assistance from the Chetnik Army. Two entire army corps totaling 3,000 men were provided him to insure ample defense against possible German interference. At Captain Brooks' suggestion, all men to be evacuated were split into six groups with an American officer in charge of each. The first of these groups was composed of all the sick and injured who were quartered near a hospital so that they could receive medical attention. The rest of the groups were dispersed in the neighboring mountains, the most distant being two hours walking distance away. Keeping with him a staff of six officers to handle staff work, Captain Brooks then directed that, to insure the most orderly and expeditious evacuation possible, a list be drafted by name, rank, and serial number of all Americans in the area together with the date of their being shot down. Meanwhile, two men (one was 1st Lt. Tom Oliver (West Point, June 1943, B-24, 756th BS, 459th BG, 15th AF, Giulia, Italy) and, ironically, academy roommate of Captain Brooks) who had been sent to contact General Mihailovic's headquarters, brought back word that on one of three specified nights friendly planes would land to evacuate those present. Captain Brooks inspected the airfield, improvised a night lighting system with a number of kerosene lamps and then set up a watch to signal the planes when they came over. Only one plane arrived, however, and it did not land, dropping supplies and three men by parachute instead. These three men (OSS team, 1st Lt. Musulin, Master Sargent Rajacich, and Navy Petty Officer Jibilian) had been sent in as an Allied mission from Italy and had brought along a radio. The officer in charge of the mission brought word that the landing strip was not considered usable by 15th Air Force and that no landing would be made until a great amount of work had been done to it. After setting up an improvised radio station with the new equipment, Captain Brooks left one officer in charge of the construction work necessary at this particular field, gave him detailed instructions on how to complete the project, and procured for him through the Chetnik Army Commander a large number of Yugoslav laborers. The remaining six officers, including himself, he divided into two man teams to investigate possible sites for another field. In this manner two better locations were discovered and work was immediately begun on those fields as well. In the meantime, radio contact with 15th Air Force was reestablished and a request made for urgently needed supplies and a message sent with regard to the work that was being done on the first field. Two transports came over shortly thereafter and dropped a considerable quantity of needed supplies. Acting under instructions previously issued by Captain Brooks, the group quartered nearest the dropping site successfully brought in all of these supplies. Several days later when construction on the first field had progressed {{to the point where it}} was usable, the 15th Air Force was notified and a message came back from that headquarters that eight aircraft would arrive that evening, each with a capacity of 12 men. Captain Brooks then sent runners to alert the first 96 men scheduled to go. The field was cleared and signal fires built. One officer was put in charge of the men and ordered to have each group of twelve men leave the woods only when its plane was ready. During this time no one else was to be on the field. Another officer was detailed to meet the planes as they landed and park them for loading, while a third officer was detailed to guide them out for takeoff. Only four aircraft (C-47A, 60thTCG, 12thAF Brindisi, Italy) came in that night, the first carrying a doctor, several assistants, and medical supplies. These four airplanes were landed, unloaded, loaded with evacuees and successfully dispatched. From the pilot of the first plane to land, Captain Brooks learned the operation was to continue throughout the following morning with friendly fighter (said to be Red Tail P-51Cs, 332nd FG, 15th AF, Cattolica, Italy) cover. He immediately sent runners to all the different groups and by 07:00 on 10 August 1944 all the remaining evacuees had been assembled in the woods adjacent to the field. To assist the aircraft, Captain Brooks had had the field marked with strips of parachutes. As each airplane came in that morning 20 men were dispatched to it and it took off. Only after all the other evacuees had been loaded did Captain Brooks get aboard the last airplane. After this last airplane had been loaded, the pilot counted 21 men aboard, one in excess of the maximum. Assuming that one would have to be left on the ground Captain Brooks immediately left the airplane as the volunteer who would stay behind. A recount by the pilot of his passengers, however, brought out that he had had only 20 instead of 21 so that it was possible for Captain Brooks to reenter, but this he did only after assuring himself that the safety of the others would not be imperiled. A total of 240 Americans, seven British, 12 Russians, five French, and five Italian officers and men were evacuated in this operation.|$|E

40|$|Countries {{compete with}} one another for funds {{distributed}} by non-government organizations (NGOs). The authors consider a competition over poverty and governance conducted by a non-government organization trying to allocate its funds among potential recipient countries. In its decision-making the NGO also {{takes into account the}} initial conditions each potential recipient faces, including the current quality of governance and wealth (poverty). For example, all else being equal the poorer country will have a higher probability of obtaining funds; or, the better the applicant's governance, the more its gains. Moreover, the <b>maximum</b> <b>aid</b> a country can obtain depends on its wealth. Investment in good governance, the wealth/poverty status of the applicant, and its current quality of governance will, together, determine the funds potential recipients expect to obtain. The authors also consider recent changes in the levels of these factors. They want to understand the roles these factors play in the competition for aid and the outcome for the quality of governance.

In this paper we generalize these techniques with two aims. First, we identify a solution which does not rely on any periodic structure, but can be implemented with a generic TH format. Second, we identify a solution which is robust to multiple access interference (MAI) by assuming a Gaussian mixture (GM) model for MAI. In fact, GMs have recently been identified as good descriptors of UWB interference, and they provide closed form and limited complexity results.

The coagulation and flocculation method is used for arsenate removal from drinking water using ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, and ferrous sulfate. The effects of coagulant type and dosage on removal efficiency of arsenate are determined by considering the residual iron after sedimentation and filtration in the effluent. At the same time the impact of the type (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and dosage of organic polymers on the removal efficiency of arsenate was investigated. Residual arsenate concentrations were decreased below 10 mg L- 1 for ferric chloride and ferrous sulfate concentration of 30 and 80 mg L- 1, respectively. Ferric chloride provided minimum and acceptable residual iron concentration (175 mg L- 1) after sedimentation and filtration and it was determined as the most effective and economic coagulant type because it requires lower amounts than the others and produces minimum residual iron. The addition of cationic polyelectrolyte <b>aided</b> <b>maximum</b> arsenate removal efficiency although all types of polymers increased the efficiency of the treatment method.

40|$|Ecological {{engineering}} {{operates in}} those scales of size and time {{where most people}} do not believe there are many scientific principles. Because humans are in this scale, they see so much detail that they can not see the organization and often seek non-scientific theories for what happens. Others, including me, believe that all scales of size and time operate according to the same common designs with common principles. By this view, the noisy detail we see around us is the trial and error process of finding what works best, and what works best can be found from scientific principles. Trial and error efforts to find the <b>maximum</b> performance are <b>aided</b> by variation and choices provided by the dynamic oscillations of the smaller scales. Horgan (1995) quotes many scientists who believe some scales have more complexity than others. My view is that all scales have the same complexity, but that humans perceive less as they look towards smaller or larger scales than their own realm.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} what aid has actually been doing {{in the area of}} environment in Tanzania through a critical review of the flows, modalities and management of aid. Focusing on the funding for environmental degradation projects, the study notes that budget expenditure allocation to these activities is around 0. 04 per cent of Tanzania's total expenditure. This is a problem given that in the near future financing for climate change alone would need around US$ 1 billion per year (or nearly 10 per cent of the budget). Ultimately, aid money is critical for Tanzania, as over 90 per cent of funds for environment come from donors. To ensure <b>maximum</b> effectiveness of <b>aid,</b> Tanzania, in collaboration with its many development partners, introduced the Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy. This resulted in an improvement in the country's operational development strategies and by 2010 out of 13 indicators with applicable targets, six were met.

40|$|Single electroplaques of Torpedo nobiliana {{have been}} studied with {{microelectrode}} recording. Direct evidence is presented that the only electrogenically reactive membrane of the cells is on the innervated surface and that this membrane is electrically inexcitable. Responses are not evoked by depolarizing currents applied to this membrane, but only by stimulating the innervating nerve fibers. The responses arise after a latency of 1 to 3 msec. This latency is not affected by large depolarizing or hyperpolarizing changes in membrane potential. Various properties that have been theoretically associated with electrically inexcitable responses have been also demonstrated {{to occur in the}} electroplaques. The neurally evoked response is not propagated actively in the membrane and may have different amplitudes and forms in closely adjacent regions. The maximal responses frequently are slightly larger than the recorded resting potential but the apparent small overshoot may be due to difficulty in recording the full resting potential. The responses are subject to electrochemical gradation and appear inverted in sign on applying strong outward currents across the innervated membrane.

Despite a shortened application process, fewer funds for the 2011-2012 program could lead to financial problems for many students. The government funded the program at $17.1 billion from 2008-2010, {{as part of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. However, the additional funding does not match the needs of increasing numbers of students who enroll in college and qualify for aid through the recession. The Pell Grant program was subject to a $5.7 billion decrease in funding as part of a continuing resolution (H.R. 1), which cleared the House in February 2011 and cut about $60 billion from the federal budget. The changes would take effect for the 2011-2012 school year, decreasing the <b>maximum</b> amount of <b>aid</b> for the most needy students from $5,550 to $4,705 a year; in addition, about 1.7 million students who receive smaller Pell Grants would become ineligible for the program.

40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis {{is to create}} an interactive, multi-media educational module. The subject is the form and function of the human kidney. This module is intended as an introductory overview to the physical description of the kidney, its tissues, functions, and its relationships with other major organs within the human body. The end product could be conceived of as a chapter in an encyclopedia set of similar such chapters. Target audiences could be, but are not limited to, secondary education and college undergraduate health science students, doctors 2 ̆ 7 patients, family of patients, and /or caregivers of individuals with kidney related health issues. This program is intended for use {{in the context of an}} interactive educational computer station, a web-based educational site, for distance learning in a virtual classroom setting and as a CD /ROM that could be purchased outright or used as reference material from a public library. The overarching design of the program is developed around four major premises. The first of these is the interactivity design. The interactive model is designed for return usage and accommodates familiarization with the program on the part of the user. First time usage navigation is prompted by the software. However, usage is fully interactive and allows for extensive self-direction by repeat users. The intention is to give the viewer <b>maximum</b> freedom of <b>aided</b> visual exploration. The second premise is the division of the intended subject matter into manageable domains. The subjects of the human kidney covered in the program include general orientation within the body, gross anatomy, internal structures, histology and function. A third organizational factor in the development of this program involves visual aesthetics and stylistic concerns. The goal was not to simplify, but rather to clarify. My intention was to concentrate on the use of still, detailed, representational, volumetric renderings of structure and form. I sought to deliberately edit the visual subject matter in the virtual environment in such a way as to promote focus. Use was made of three-dimensional graphic modeling programs to emphasize structural relationships. Cross-sectional imagery from the Virtual Human project of the National Library of Medicine is used as a graphic corollary to my own illustrations to invite greater realism in the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s experience of the subject. A final concern in the development of this program is the choice of medium. The project is conceived of as a chance to make in-depth exploration into the use of electronic art mediums. The reality of my own experience is that the development of this program has drawn from, and touched upon, virtually every aspect of my education within the Master of Fine Arts in Medical Illustration program at Rochester Institute of Technology.

(Ce dernier examen pivote autour d'une excellente opérationnalisation faite récemment par Bowen et Finegan de l'analyse traditionnelle de l'offre du travail.) Dans un deuxième temps, ils s'attardent à quelques facteurs susceptibles d'affecter plus spécifiquement les parents de familles à faible revenu. Ils suggèrent d'abord une définition opérationnelle de chacun de ces facteurs, puis une mesure possible dans le cadre d'une enquête sur le terrain. Enfin, ils formulent l'hypothèse attendue entre chaque facteur et le taux d'activité. En conclusion, ils rapportent quelques résultats de recherches empiriques relativement aux effets de revenu et de substitution. The present {{article presents}} {{in part a}} progress report of a research which tries to estimate the impact of public programs of economic security in Québec on the work effort of parents of low-income families. Our interest in such a research comes from the recent but increasing effort of our society to fight poverty, and more particularly from {{the passing of the}} Social Aid Act by the Québec Government in 1969. The question of incentive to work takes a particular importance, since, according to this Act, benefits to families are calculated as the difference between income and needs, whatever the labour force participation of their members. SUPPLY OF LABOUR AND LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATEThe essential of the traditional analysis of labour supply is retained in empirical studies of labour supply, often called studies of labour force participation rate : the main emphasis is on the estimate of the income and substitution effects. Theoretically, the income effect is negative, whereas the substitution one is positive. But, the net effect is an empirical question. Bowen and Finegan have published, in 1969, a quite interesting operationalisation of the traditional analysis of labour supply. They have identified four (4) classes of variables as influencing the decision of the family in the allocation of its time. The classes are : tastes, expected market earnings rates, expected non-market earnings rates, and family resources. It is important to underline the third use of time introduced through non-market earnings {{and the fact that the}} family is considered as the relevant decision-making unit. Before proceeding to a brief analysis of the main factors used in many empirical studies, it is worth mentionning the model published by Cain, in 1966, to explain the labour force participation rate of married women. The variables in his general model were : potential family income, market wage for the wife, home wage for the wife, market wage of other family members, home wage of other family members, wife's tastes for market work relative to homework and leisure, and an error term. For empirical studies of disaggregated data for cross-sections, Cain proposed a model including the following variables : permanent income, transitory income, market earnings for the wife, presence of children, education and age of the wife. The variables examined in the third section of the present article have been in large part suggested by this last model. For the present research, the low-income family is defined as one with total annual income under 150 % of <b>maximum</b> Social <b>Aid</b> plus family allowances. A pilot field survey has been done mainly to validate the research instruments. But, no results are presented here, since the sample used was not representative of the population, among other reasons. MAIN FACTORS IN EMPIRICAL STUDIESThe effort here is to interpret the factors used in many empirical studies in terms of the four classes of variables reported above. For instance, it seems very significant to identify the variables used as proxies and also to investigate the rational for their use. Such an investigation may greatly help to specify a particular model as well as to interpret empirical results. The proxy variables examined here are : education, age, number and age of children, sex, marital status, work status, occupation, health, ethnic origin, residence and housing. The other variables covered are direct ones, that is they are not used as indirect measures for other variables. But proxies may have to be used for direct variables. For instance, tastes for market work have to be approximated by other variables, such as education, age, residence, health, housing, etc [...] . The variable « other family incomes » is defined as the total family income minus the income of the parent concerned. The variable gives a very good estimate of the pure income effect that is negative on the work effort of a person. The expected market earnings rate is certainly the most influential variable. Theoretically at least, the relation is positive with the labour supply. In a field survey, one can use the actual rate as an excellent proxy for the expected one, of course, for the working people. For those not working, they can be asked what their perceptions are. The same is more or less true for the other direct variable, expected non-market earning rate. The last direct variable here, tastes for market work, has already been discussed. Education is very often used as a proxy variable in studies of labour force participation rate. It certainly represents an excellent approximation for personal job prospects and for tastes for market work. More or less the same comments can be made about age, except that in addition to education, age affects labour supply through the family cycle, or in other words the number and age of children. This last variable serves as a good proxy for tastes for home goods as well as for monetary income. The rational for the use of health and sex is somehow similar as for the use of the three proceeding proxies. In a similar vein, this is more or less true for their effect on work effort. Of course, marital status also is generally used in empirical studies of labour supply. Moreover, most of such studies and probably the best of them, have been made for married women. It is evident that their expected home wage rate generally is far greater than the one for their husbands. The same can also be said about tastes for home tasks. The husband's (wife's) work status is another proxy in large part related to the marital status, and it affects the labour supply through the other family incomes. The occupation of a person and her ethnic origin serve as good approximations for tastes for market work and, among others, for personal job prospects. Residence affects work effort through proximity to job opportunities. The last proxy considered here, housing, is ambiguous, since it can affect the tastes for monetary income as well as being affected by it. FACTORS MORE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE PRÉSENT RESEARCHWe briefly examine thereafter some factors that we consider more particularly relevant for an empirical study trying to explain the work effort of parents of low-income families, using disaggregated data collected for cross-sections in a field survey. Some of the variables have been suggested by the model used by Gain and mentionned above. For the sake of brevity, and taking into account what has been said earlier, it seems sufficient only to mention here the following variables : expected market earnings rate, expected home earnings rate and other family incomes. Transitory income calls for a short additional comment. It is defined as the difference between permanent income and actual income for a family, the permanent income being Friedman's concept presented earlier. The last three factors considered here deal with the public programs of economic security. Two distinctions are made in this respect. First, the benefits received by a parent are taken separately from those by his family, since we feel that the strength of the relationship differs from one case to the other. Second, we consider apart the social aid from the other programs, mainly because of its nature of last resort program. Moreover, we operationalize this last variable by defining it as the difference between the total benefits his family would have received from social aid if the parent concerned had not been working at all, during the last year, and the benefits his family would have received if the same parent had been working full time, during the same period. CONCLUSIONGiven the economists' interest for the income and substitution effects, we report a few results from empirical studies. Mincer found that for married women the substitution effect in terms of elasticity was twice larger than the income effect. Cain confirmed such results. Rowlatt recently reported interesting results for persons living in low-income families in Alberta, substantiating the proceeding ones...|$|R
