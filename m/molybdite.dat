40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the potential risks of intoxication following the ingestion of wild mushrooms. Methodology and results: This study was carried out on four different species of wild mushrooms including two edible species Chlorophyllum cf. <b>molybdites</b> and Phlebopus sudanicus and two medicinal ones, Ganoderma lucidum and Phellinus pachyphloeus. These species were analyzed on their acute toxicity and their LD 50 were calculated based on dry material. The fresh mushroom weights equivalent to the threshold of the LD 50 was also evaluated. The fungal species LD 50 were 695. 62 mg/kg; 679. 09 mg/kg; 395. 19 mg/kg and 1070. 79 mg/kg for P. sudanicus, C. cf. <b>molybdites,</b> G. lucidum and P. pachyphloeus respectively. By comparing these values to the scale of toxicity from Hodge and Sterner, the extracts of P. sudanicus, C. cf. <b>molybdites</b> and P. pachyphloeus are classified among the substances slightly toxic while G lucidum is classified like toxic substance. The fresh mushrooms values equivalent to the lyophilized used for the species were 2. 47 kg; 3. 67 kg; 1. 22 kg and 7. 96 kg respectively for P. sudanicus, C. cf. <b>molybdites,</b> G. lucidum and P. Pachyphloeus. Conclusion and application of results: By taking a minimum of precautions, these species could be developed on the nutritional and therapeutic level. However, it is necessary to undertake toxicity study on the fresh materia...|$|R

40|$|Molybdenum and {{tungsten}} porphyry mineralization occurs near Bear Mountain {{in northeast}} Alaska within a regional zone of small domes and intrusions. This zone {{can be traced}} 80 km {{to the west and}} easterly into Canada. A 50 -ha (approximately 100 acres) mineralized area, defined by soil samples containing greater than 600 ppm Mo and 500 ppm W, is underlain by an altered complex of probable early Tertiary age consisting of rhyolite porphyry, quartz porphyry, intrusive breccia, and rhyolite porphyry dikes. The complex has intruded upper Paleozoic metasedimentary ocks. Surface exposures of rubble and limited outcrop are extensively leached; molybdenum occurs as <b>molybdite</b> oxides and tungsten occurs in both ferberite and huebnerite nd members of the wolframite series.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the nature of}} the precursor and the amount used is investigated in the preparation of MoO 3 catalysts supported on a mesoporous silica by a wet impregnation method. Four precursors are compared: ammonium heptamolybdate, peroxopolymolybdate, a citrate complex of MO and an oxalate complex of Mo. The MoO 3 loading is adjusted between 0 and 2 theoretical monolayers of MoO 3. Characterization of the samples was performed by N- 2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with as main objective the evaluation of the dispersion of MoO 3 on the silica and of the morphology of MoO 3 crystallites eventually obtained. At low loadings, MoO 3 appears as amorphous material remaining at the outer surface of the silica. At high loadings, MoO 3 appears as <b>molybdite</b> crystals. The loading above which MoO 3 crystals are obtained depends on the precursor used. The morphology of MoO 3 crystals, when obtained, also depends on the precursor used. Isotropic crystals are obtained with Mo oxalate and peroxopolymolybdate while Mo citrate leads to crystals with largely developed basal faces. Ammonium heptamolybdate leads to crystals with an intermediate morphology. Our results thus show that changing the nature and the amount of precursor used to impregnate MoO 3 on silica offers a promising possibility to adjust the morphology and, to some extent, the dispersion of MoO 3 crystals at the surface of the support...|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyllum is a genus {{of large}} agarics similar in {{appearance}} {{to the true}} parasol mushroom. Chlorophyllum was originally coined in 1898, a time when spore color was the deciding factor for differentiating genera. It was termed in order to describe the poisonous green-spored C. <b>molybdites</b> which shared many characteristics of the mushrooms within the genus Lepiota but lacked the all important white spores. The name comes from Greek Chloro meaning green and phyll meaning leaves or gills. It remained as a genus of one lonely member until recently when modern DNA analyses concluded {{that many of the}} mushrooms contained in the genus Macrolepiota actually had more in common genetically with the Chlorophyllum <b>molybdites</b> than with {{the other members of the}} Macrolepiota. The genus has a widespread distribution, with many species found in tropical regions. The best known members are the edible shaggy parasol, a name applied to three very similar species Chlorophyllum rhacodes, C. olivieri and C. brunneum, and the poisonous C. <b>molybdites,</b> which is widespread in subtropical regions around the world.|$|R
50|$|The parasol {{mushroom}} {{is difficult to}} mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike Chlorophyllum <b>molybdites</b> does not occur. Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times.|$|R
50|$|The {{mushroom}} {{can sometimes}} {{be confused with the}} magpie fungus which is poisonous. In America, the 'vomiter' mushroom Chlorophyllum <b>molybdites</b> is responsible for most cases of mushroom poisoning due to its similarity with shaggy mane and other edible mushrooms.|$|R
40|$|Texture, i. e. {{preferred}} orientation, {{can cause}} large systematic errors in quantitative analysis of crystalline materials using {{x-ray powder diffraction}} (XRPD) data. Various mathematical forms have been proposed {{for the application of}} preferred orientation corrections. The most promising of these appears to be the single-parameter March (1932) model proposed by Dollase (1986). Li and O'Connor (1989) applied the March model to determine the level of preferred orientation in various gibbsites using two procedures. The first involved the Rietveld (1969) least squares pattern-fitting method. Each pattern was Rietveld-analysed in two ways, initially assuming random orientation of the crystallites and subsequently with the March model. The second procedure for preferred orientation analysis, described here as the line ratio method, determines preferred orientation factors according to the intensity ratios of carefully selected line pairs. In the thesis the procedures proposed by Li and O'Connor for texture analysis have been evaluated with XRPD data sets for <b>molybdite,</b> calcite and kaolinite. The results indicate that while the March formula improves agreement between the' calculated and measured patterns in Rietveld analysis, other forms of systematic error in the intensity data appear to limit the effectiveness of the March formula in general. It has been found also that the line ratio method improves agreement between the data sets, but less effectively than the Rietveld method. It is proposed that extinction {{is likely to be the}} most influential source of systematic error competing with texture...|$|E
40|$|Texture in {{crystalline}} materials, i. e. {{preferred orientation}} (PO), {{is of interest}} in terms of texture-property relationships and also in X-ray diffraction science because PO can cause serious systematic errors in quantitative phase analysis using diffraction data. The single- parameter, pole-density distribution function (PDDF), proposed by March (1932) to represent PO in diffraction analysis, is used widely it Rietveld pattern-fitting following a suggestion by Dollase (1986). While the March model is an excellent descriptor of PO for gibbsite [AI(OH) 3] x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data (O'Connor, Li and Sitepu, 1991), the model {{has proved to be}} deficient for Rietveld modelling with <b>molybdite</b> [Mo 03], calcite [CaCO 3] and kaolinite [A 12 O 3. 2 SiO 2. 2 H 2 O] XRPD data (Sitepu, 1991; O'Connor, Li and Sitepu, 1992; and Sitepu, O'Connor and Li, 1996). Therefore, the March model should not be regarded as a general-purpose PDDF descriptor. This study has examined the validity of the March model using XRPD and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) instruments operated, respectively, by the Curtin Materials Research Group in Perth and by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation at the HIFAR reactor facility at Lucas Heights near Sydney. Extensive suites of XRPD and NPD data were measured for uniaxially-pressed powders of <b>molybdite</b> and calcite, for which the compression was systematically varied. It is clear from the various Rietveld refinements that the March model becomes increasingly unsatisfactory as the uniaxial pressure (and, therefore, the level of PO) increases. The March model has been tested with a physical relationship developed by the author which links the March r-parameter to the uniaxial pressure via the powder bulk modulus, B. The agreement between the results obtained from directly measured values of B and from Rietveld analysis with the March model are ++promising in terms of deducing the powder bulk modulus from the March r-parameter. An additional test of the March model was made with NPD data for specimens mounted, first, parallel to the instrument rotation axis and, then, normal to the axis. The results have provided some further indication that the March model is deficient for the materials considered in the study. During the course of the study, it was found that there are distinct differences between the direction of the near-surface texture in calcite, as measured by XRPD, and bulk texture characterised by NPD. The NPD-derived textures appear to be correct descriptions for the bulk material in uniaxially-pressed powders, whereas the XRPD textures are heavily influenced by the pressing procedure. An additional outcome of the NPD work has been the discovery, made jointly with Dr Brett Hunter of ANSTO, that the popular LHPM Rietveld code did not allow for inclusion of PO contributions from symmetry-equivalent reflections. Revision of the code by Dr Hunter showed that there is substantial bias in Rietveld-March r-parameters if these reflections are not factored correctly into the calculations. Finally, examination of pole-figure data has underlined {{the extent to which the}} March model oversimplifies the true distributions. It is concluded that spherical harmonics modelling should be used rather than the March model as a general PO modelling tool...|$|E
40|$|Porphyry-type Cu (Mo, Au) {{deposits}} {{have been}} discovered along the Gangdese magmatic arc in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Extensive field investigations and systematic studies of geochemistry, S–Pb isotopic tracing, together with Re–Os and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isotopic dating indicate that the mineralisation of the copper belt is genetically related to emplacement of late orogenic granitic porphyries during the post-collisional crustal relaxation period of the Late Himalayan epoch. These porphyries are petrochemically K-enriched and belong to shoshonitic to high-K calc-alkaline series. They display enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) Rb, K, U, Th, Sr, Pb and depletion of high field strength elements (HFSE) Nb, Ta, Ti and the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and Y without Eu anomalies. These characteristics demonstrate that subduction played a dominant role in their petrogenesis and residual garnet {{was left in the}} magma sources. Pb isotope data show a linear correlation in the plumbotectonic framework diagram ranging from orogenic Pb in the eastern segment of the copper belt to mantle Pb in the western segment. These constitute a mixing line of the Indian Oceanic MORB with Indian Oceanic sediments and suggest that the porphyry magmas were dominantly derived from partial melting of subducted oceanic crusts mixed with a minor quantity of sediments and mantle wedge components. The Gangdese porphyry copper polymetallic belt has alteration characteristics and zonation typical of porphyry-type copper deposits which include potassic alteration (K-feldspathisation and biotitisation), silicification, sericitisation, and propylitisation. Mineralisation mainly occurs in strongly altered granitic cataclasite at the exo-contact with veinlet-disseminated textures. The porphyries themselves are weakly mineralised with disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite. The copper deposits contain simple ore mineral associations consisting of chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, molybdenite, sphalerite and oxidised minerals of malachite, covellite and <b>molybdite.</b> During supergene oxidation, primary ores underwent secondary enrichment to form economic orebodies with Cu grade ranging from 1...|$|E
