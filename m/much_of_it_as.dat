The amount of Scribes was 43 companions. And there were many people who though were not scribes also were complete memorizers. After Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr initially exercised a policy of laissez faire as well. This policy was reversed after the Battle of Yamama in 633. During the battle, 700 Muslims who had memorized the Quran were killed. The death of Salim, however, was most significant, as {{he was one of}} the very few who had been entrusted by Muhammad to teach the Quran. Consequently, upon Umar's insistence, Abu Bakr ordered the collection of the hitherto scattered pieces of the Quran into one copy.|$|E

500|$|Prescott {{expressed}} interest in his correspondence in writing a biography of Molière, and Ticknor records that he sent Prescott [...] "a collection of about 50 volumes" [...] of relevant material. However, after writing to Ángel Calderón de la Barca, a Spanish minister living in Mexico, {{who was able to}} provide source material, Prescott started research on what was to become the History of the Conquest of Mexico. He extensively read the works of Alexander von Humboldt, who had written on Mesoamerica, and started corresponding with the historian Washington Irving, the Swiss writer Sismondi and the French historian Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry. [...] He also received assistance in collecting sources from a college friend, Middleton, and a Dr. Lembke. In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the History of Ferdinand and Isabella, Prescott started drafting the History of the Conquest of Mexico in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on Aztec civilization, and Prescott dismissed <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "speculation", [...] and he therefore had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of Humboldt). In particular, he considered Edward King's theory that the pre-Columbian civilizations were non-indigenous to be fallacious, although he was greatly indebted to him for his anthology of Aztec codices in the Antiquities of Mexico. Prescott also studied Spanish writers contemporary to the conquest, most significantly Torquemada and Toribio de Benavente.|$|E

2500|$|The Protestant Reformation {{during the}} 16th century in Europe almost entirely {{rejected}} the existing tradition of Catholic art, {{and very often}} destroyed as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> it could reach.

2500|$|Historians Victor Davis Hanson and Donald Kagan {{have argued}} that Epaminondas' {{so-called}} [...] "oblique formation" [...] was not an intentional and preconceived innovation in infantry tactics, but was rather a clever response to circumstances.

[...] This means that their maintenance of a depth of eight to twelve shields had to {{come at the expense of}} either number of companies or their width. [...] Because Epaminondas was already outnumbered, he had no choice but to form fewer companies and march them diagonally toward the much longer Spartan line in order to engage as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> possible.

2500|$|Because God is [...] "an {{absolutely}} perfect being" [...] (I), Leibniz {{argues that}} God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection {{than what he}} is able of (III). His syllogism then ends {{with the statement that}} God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, {{we have to understand that}} God [...] "is the best of all masters" [...] and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.|$|E
