25|$|After the {{announcement}} of a regular steamship service route between New Orleans and Port Aransas, the United States Congress commissioned $12,500 {{for the construction of}} the Aransas Pass Lighthouse. Haggling over lighthouse's specifications mired down the process and another survey was done. Meanwhile, the pass slowly moved south as currents deposited sand on its north bank {{at the south end of}} Saint Joseph Island. It was then advised that a lightship be used to mark the pass. More surveying was done, <b>more</b> <b>talk</b> and then a proposition was accepted to erect a screw-pile lighthouse of brick.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 the Federal Government {{was asked}} {{simultaneously}} {{by the same}} contractor for a concession for the Zermatt-Gornergrat railway, and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one. The Gornergrat railway was constructed, and has been working since 1899, {{but there has been}} no <b>more</b> <b>talk</b> of the other. The project essentially consisted of a line which went up to the Hörnli, and continued thence in a rectilinear tunnel about two kilometres long, built under the ridge, and issuing near the summit on the Zmutt side. Sixty years later in 1950, Italian engineer Count Dino Lora Totino planned a cable car on the Italian side from Breuil-Cervinia to the summit. But the Alpine Museum of Zermatt sent a protest letter with 90,000 signatures to the Italian government. The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.|$|E

500|$|In the Fifth Victory Test, under {{overcast}} conditions {{against a}} swinging and seaming ball, Miller struck 14 {{from his first}} over and finished 77 not out, in a display that featured strong cutting and driving. Australia could manage only 173, and England were on top. Miller took one wicket with the ball but managed only four in the second innings as England won, to square the series 2–2. Hassett wrote {{at the end of}} the series that [...] "This is cricket as it should be... let's have no <b>more</b> <b>talk</b> of [...] "war" [...] in cricket". Miller topped the batting averages for the series, with 443 runs at 63.28. His aggregate exceeded those of Hammond and Hutton, and he also took 10 wickets at 27.70. Of Miller's batting, Hassett said that [...] "as a strokeplayer he is second to none", and his performance earned comparisons to Jack Gregory, who had a similar breakthrough after World War I.|$|E
500|$|The Victory Tests were {{expected}} to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured {{a large number of}} draws due to defensive play. Australia unexpectedly drew the series 2–2, and Hassett wrote {{at the end of the}} series that [...] "This is cricket as it should be ... These games have shown that international cricket can be played as between real friends—so let's have no <b>more</b> <b>talk</b> of [...] "war" [...] in cricket". The series was regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 watching the bright and attacking play. In the five Victory Tests, Hassett made 277 runs at 27.70, including two fifties. The Services and Australian Imperial Force teams played separate matches in England during the season, which lasted until September, although only one other Services match was given first-class status. Hassett scored three centuries in matches for the Services.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{described}} book as clever, well written, engaging, amusing, and fun. The prose {{was described}} as [...] "effortless", [...] "colorful", [...] "kinetic and often witty". Numerous reviewers thought the Dr. Impossible character was {{the highlight of the}} novel. The Library Journal review [...] "highly recommended [...] for all public libraries" [...] calling it [...] "fun and thought-provoking book". In The New York Times Book Review reviewer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel [...] "can't completely measure up , but its ambition and persistence in the face of formidable odds make it an admirable addition to the genre". The Publishers Weekly review noted that the comic book scenario written in a prose novel, with [...] "thoughtfully portrayed" [...] characters, would broaden the appeal of the genre. Similarly, regarding the comic book set-up written in prose, Mat Johnson in USA Today wrote that Grossman's [...] "fabulist vision is meticulously captured so that it might be gleefully explored, nostalgically, within its traditional boundaries". Journalist Carlo Wolff wrote that [...] "it takes some time to engage because...Grossman is so enamored of the worlds he's fashioning that he overstuffs them... is a fresh, warm take on comic books, science fiction and pop culture." [...] The Kirkus Reviews summary notes that the action scenes are [...] "unimpressive, interrupted by <b>more</b> <b>talk</b> as...the battle seesaws in an arbitrary fashion. For all the special effects, a debut novel that's lifeless and inert." [...] Both the reviewers for Entertainment Weekly and Christian Science Monitor gave the book a [...] "B" [...] grade, though The A.V. Club gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade.
