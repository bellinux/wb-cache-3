500|$|They fire [...] {{projectiles}} using a [...] gunpowder cartridge. Though {{they were}} insufficient against contemporary battleships, {{they were seen}} as adequate for the light cruisers that the fort was expected to face. The carriages weighed [...] and moved on semi-circular traverses. The guns were loaded either manually—using the Woolwich (derrick) system—or via the Armstrong <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader.</b> The Armstrong system enabled loading of the guns from behind {{the protection of the}} rampart whereas the manual system required at least two crew to be exposed on the rampart's top. Despite this the guns were manually loaded for most of their operational life as the Armstrong cable drive was faulty and too difficult to maintain. The guns had a 14-man crew and loading took about 2 minutes, a rate of fire that was only slightly faster using the Armstrong equipment.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{corrugated}} iron shelter of recent construction is located {{just to the}} west of the workshops. This covers two Jenbach, diesel locomotives. An enclosure near the number three portal contains a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader</b> and a mechanical coal cutter.|$|E
50|$|Cane lifts became {{redundant}} {{after the}} widespread introduction of chopper mechanical harvesters. Mechanical harvesting was attempted with little real success {{from the late}} 19th century. The development of mechanical harvesters accelerated from World War II. The first harvesters cut the cane as whole stalks. This meant that the labour-intensive task of bundling whole cane stalks and loading them continued. From the early 1950s, <b>mechanical</b> <b>loaders</b> alleviated this problem to some extent.|$|R

50|$|Several {{manufacturers}} {{display their}} construction {{machinery and equipment}} in a dedicated outdoor demonstration area called INTERMAT Demo, providing the opportunity to highlight machinery and equipment performance in simulated working conditions. The programme includes demonstrations of site machinery: backhoe <b>loaders,</b> <b>mechanical</b> diggers, mini-excavators, <b>loaders</b> and graders.|$|R
50|$|The gun {{was mounted}} {{longitudinally}} in the fuselage centreline, at a depressed angle, {{and had a}} powerful recoil, which the 27 tonne (30 ton) airframe was able to absorb. The amount of ammunition that could be carried was around 50-60 rounds for the main gun, as well as up to three standard torpedoes or two radio-guided torpedoes (a secret weapon which was never used in combat), and for the defensive wing and fuselage turrets. The 102 mm (4 in) gun {{was intended to be}} fitted with a ballistic sight with an analogue computer, and a six or 12 round <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's {{design has}} traded off {{interior}} space {{in return for}} a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader.</b> The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed. The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks. This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the SU-152G was the D-50/D-1 152-mm howitzer. It {{was completely}} unified for ballistic characteristics, internal devices and ammunition with the D-1 152 mm towed howitzer. The barrel {{was connected to}} the breech, and a muzzle brake was fixed to the barrel. A vertical wedge gate was installed in the breech, along with a semi-automatic, free-floating ejector. To ease the loading process, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader</b> was placed as well. A ZIS-3 panoramic sight along with an OP1-7 direct-fire sight were needed for firing from closed positions to sighted targets. The ammo rack of the SU-152G was capable of holding 42 shells.|$|E

50|$|A coal trestle is a {{rigid frame}} trestle {{supporting}} train tracks above chutes, used to deliver fuel to boats or trains beneath it. At {{the top of}} the trestle, train rolling stock, typically hopper cars, open doors on their undersides or on their sides to discharge cargo. The coal trestles were also used to transfer coal from mining railroads to rail cars on lines traveling further away. Coal trestles were prominent when coal was an important fuel for rail locomotion and steamships and before coal trestles were replaced with <b>mechanical</b> coal <b>loaders</b> in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Keying was {{accomplished}} by setting each switch in a matrix of switches to one of several positions. This was done using a separate <b>mechanical</b> key <b>loader</b> (KYK-28) that had a matching matrix of pins that could be set to different heights as instructed by a key list. The key loader was pushed into a matrix of holes, one hole for each switch. The loader also had two larger index pins that also cocked a spring that would return each switch to their initial position when the door covering the hole matrix was reopened, zeroizing the equipment.|$|R
50|$|They fire 400 lb {{projectiles}} using a 130 lb gunpowder cartridge. Though {{they were}} insufficient against contemporary battleships, {{they were seen}} as adequate for the light cruisers that the fort was expected to face.

40|$|Malaysia is {{the second}} largest palm oil {{producer}} in the world. Despite oil palm industry is the fourth largest contributor to the national economy, this industry has been suffering from shortage of labour. Increasing land usage for the oil palm industry raises number of worker demand and increase the production cost. Thus, farm mechanization such as tractor mounted mechanical grabber loader with trailer is introduced for in-field collection and evacuation of FFB to reduce manpower dependency as well lowering the production cost. The data is measured and collected directly at the Johawaki Plantation estate in Lekir, Perak {{with the cooperation of}} the managing staff. This study compares the material capacity, effective field capacity and production cost between mechanical grabber loader and semi-mechanised tractor loader for in field FFB collection operation. Result indicates that material capacity, tonne per hour increased by 1. 4 times with mechanical grabber loader compared to semi-mechanised tractor loader. Furthermore, the effective capacity of mechanical grabber is 2. 56 hectare/hour which is higher compared to semi-mechanised tractor loader, 2 hectare/hour. Besides, the production cost, cost per tonne for <b>mechanical</b> <b>loader</b> system obtained is 2. 5 fold lower than semi-mechanised tractor loader at the study site...|$|E

50|$|In 1928 {{with the}} entry of new shareholders, the name was changed and {{important}} work begins such as a new aerial cable and a plant with large dimensions in Rio (Cabeço do Pião). Production returns to values close to 30 t of concentrate per month. New production stoppage period from 1931 to 1934. At this time a tin smelting furnace was installed in Rio. In 1934 {{there was a new}} increase of the wolfram prices and consequent growth of the activity in the three main exploration areas of the concession (Panasqueira, Barroca Grande and Rio). This cycle associated with the Second World War was remarkable with 750 workers in 1934; 4,457 in 1942 and 10,540 workers in 1943. The Plant at Rio reached a capacity of 300 t per day and Panasqueira 1,000 t per day. The monthly production of concentrates reached 300 t, more {{than the rest of the}} country. It is at that time that the connection is made Underground from Barroca Grande to Panasqueira. At the time of the Second World War, Panasqueira was the largest mine in the country and one of the largest wolfram mines in the world. The price of the wolfram dropped drastically at the end of the Second World War, only increasing again in 1950 due to the Korean War. During this period there was a great modernization of the company with the introduction of scrapers and <b>mechanical</b> <b>loaders.</b> Mules were replaced by locomotives. The production of cassiterite was increased to compensate the low prices of wolfram. The production of copper concentrates began in 1962. From 1957 to 1965 there was a further decrease in the price of wolfram which resulted in a reduction of production in order to control cost. During this period the company increaed the production of tin to compensate the low wolfram prices. In 1966, there was a positive evolution that peaked in 1970 and this corresponded to a period of expansion. However, soon afterwards prices suddenly dropped again. During this period the production was stockpiled instead of selling below the production price, but due to the financial expenses it was decided to increase the capital with {{the entry of}} new Shareholders.|$|R
