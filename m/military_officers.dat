5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to proclaim that any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> and students, and in the following years, several German <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E

5|$|After the Saur revolution, Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led {{to the establishment of}} three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.|$|E
5|$|Against the {{judgement}} {{of many of}} {{his senior}} <b>military</b> <b>officers,</b> Hitler ordered an attack on France and the Low Countries, which began in May 1940. They quickly conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium and France surrendered on 22 June. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever.|$|E
5|$|German <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> were {{disappointed}} by the limited extent of the attack, which ultimately achieved more political goals than strategic ones. Russia's Black Sea Fleet was not seriously damaged by the raid. The gunboat Donetz was later raised and returned to service.|$|E

5|$|Kozelsk and Starobelsk {{were used}} mainly for <b>military</b> <b>officers,</b> while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers.

5|$|Like scholar-officials, {{military}} generals {{were ranked}} in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations {{every five years}} (as opposed to three years for officials). However, <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> had less prestige than officials. This was due to their hereditary service (instead of solely merit-based) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence (wu) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge (wen). Although seen as less prestigious, <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> were not excluded from taking civil service examinations, and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills. In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period, the Ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector. In the early half of the dynasty, men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office; this trend was reversed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E

5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later.

5|$|Although the Marine Direct Air Support Center was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} to trust the sensors (which in fact replaced ground patrolling), they were soon convinced of their utility.

5|$|Although {{weakened}} {{and pushed}} south beyond the Huai River, the Southern Song found {{new ways to}} bolster its strong economy and defend itself against the Jin dynasty.
