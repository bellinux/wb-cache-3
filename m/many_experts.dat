Defensively Copenhagen only conceded goals in six games, with <b>many</b> <b>experts</b> {{claiming}} that he was one of the best players of the spring season.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bush {{announced}} the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution {{through the use}} of emissions trading programs. <b>Many</b> <b>experts</b> argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.

5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and <b>many</b> <b>experts</b> do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with <b>many</b> <b>experts</b> believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film.

The game was the final competition of the 2007 football season for each team and resulted in a 41–38 East Carolina victory, even though sportsbooks favored Boise State to win by 10½ points. <b>Many</b> <b>experts</b> believed East Carolina to be big underdogs to Boise State, which had defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl.

5|$|Various {{conflicting}} accounts {{exist that}} describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The {{first of these}} rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to <b>many</b> <b>experts</b> that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron {{was used in the}} treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye.|$|E

He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by late in his freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American. By {{the beginning of his}} senior season, he was considered to be a top 5 player by most talent evaluators and his stock was still on the rise.

He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.|$|E
5|$|The close {{similarities}} between Gorgosaurus libratus and Albertosaurus sarcophagus have led <b>many</b> <b>experts</b> to combine them into one genus over the years. Albertosaurus was named first, so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus, which is sometimes considered its junior synonym. William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted {{the distinction of}} the two genera as early as 1922. Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus (as Albertosaurus libratus) by Dale Russell in 1970, and many subsequent authors followed his lead. Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus Albertosaurus. Other experts maintain the two genera as separate. Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims {{there are as many}} anatomical differences between Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus as there are between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always kept separate. He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska, New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation. Gregory S. Paul has suggested that Gorgosaurus libratus is ancestral to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. <b>Many</b> <b>experts</b> believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E
