5|$|Aptitude is {{a command}} line tool that {{also offers a}} text-based user interface. The program comes with {{enhancements}} such as better search on package <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.0a was {{released}} on April 8, 2015 and added support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) video with static <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the <b>metadata</b> associated with metagenomic projects. <b>Metadata</b> includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, <b>metadata</b> and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|Database {{forensics}} is {{a branch}} of digital forensics relating to the forensic study of databases and their <b>metadata.</b> Investigations use database contents, log files and in-RAM data to build a timeline or recover relevant information.|$|E
5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a {{repository}} providing free and unrestricted access to annotated DNA and RNA sequences. It also stores complementary {{information such as}} experimental procedures, details of sequence assembly and other <b>metadata</b> related to sequencing projects.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.0b was {{released}} March, 2016. HDMI 2.0b initially supported the same HDR10 standard as HDMI 2.0a as {{specified in the}} CTA-861.3 specification. In December 2016 additional support for HDR Video transport was added to HDMI 2.0b in the recently released CTA-861-G specification which extends the static <b>metadata</b> signaling to include Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG).|$|E
5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including <b>metadata</b> and file data. <b>Metadata</b> and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 Ã— 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E
25|$|In PDF 1.4, {{support was}} added for <b>Metadata</b> Streams, using the Extensible <b>Metadata</b> Platform (XMP) to add XML standards-based {{extensible}} <b>metadata</b> {{as used in}} other file formats. This allows <b>metadata</b> to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, {{as well as the}} whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metadata</b> Authority Description Schema (MADS), an XML schema for an {{authority}} element set {{that may be}} used to provide <b>metadata</b> about agents (people, organizations), events, and terms (topics, geographics, genres, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The indecs Content Model as used {{within the}} DOI system {{associates}} <b>metadata</b> with objects. A small kernel of common <b>metadata</b> {{is shared by}} all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the <b>metadata</b> for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.|$|E
25|$|As an example, <b>metadata</b> is used {{in media}} {{purchased}} from Apple's iTunes Store for DRM-free as well as DRM-restricted versions of their music or videos. This information is included as MPEG standard <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pools {{and their}} {{associated}} ZFS file {{systems can be}} moved between different platform architectures, including systems implementing different byte orders. The ZFS block pointer format stores filesystem <b>metadata</b> in an endian-adaptive way; individual <b>metadata</b> blocks are written with the native byte order of the system writing the block. When reading, if the stored endianness does not match the endianness of the system, the <b>metadata</b> is byte-swapped in memory.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this, {{there is a}} growing awareness amongst the research community that sample <b>metadata</b> is vital for understanding the underlying data. Further, chances for re-use, aggregation and integration of data are increased with improved <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Agents, Plex can {{automatically}} gather <b>metadata</b> {{information and}} artwork for media {{stored in the}} Plex library. These <b>metadata</b> are fetched from the following sites using web scraping: The Movie Database (TMDb) for synopses and thumbnails for movies and TV shows, TheTVDB just for TV show <b>metadata</b> and thumbnails, Fanart.tv, Freebase, CineMaterial, VEVO Music Videos for clips (only available with Plex Pass), Last.fm and LyricFind for lyrics and OpenSubtitles.org for subtitles.|$|E
25|$|In {{accord with}} the W3C's Semantic Web initiative, SVG allows authors to provide <b>metadata</b> about SVG content. The main {{facility}} is the <metadata> element, where the document can be described using Dublin Core <b>metadata</b> properties (e.g. title, creator/author, subject, description, etc.). Other <b>metadata</b> schemas may also be used. In addition, SVG defines <title> and <desc> elements where authors may also provide plain-text descriptive material within an SVG image to help indexing, searching and retrieval {{by a number of}} means.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metadata</b> Working Group {{was formed}} by a {{consortium}} of companies in 2006 (according to their web page) or 2007 (as stated in their own press release). Version 2.0 of the specification was released in November 2010, giving recommendations concerning the use of Exif, IPTC and XMP <b>metadata</b> in images.|$|E
25|$|Standards for identified-object <b>metadata</b> (examples): vCard, Dublin Core, etc.|$|E
25|$|The Zune {{software}} organizes {{the media}} in its library and allows users {{to add to the}} library by ripping from CDs, syncing with a Zune device, and downloading from the Zune Marketplace. The Zune software also allows one to organize song <b>metadata.</b> It can automatically download album art and <b>metadata</b> tag data for content in the library.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its library services, the Library of Congress is also actively involved in various standard activities in areas related to bibliographical and search and retrieve standards. Areas of work include MARC standards, <b>Metadata</b> Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), <b>Metadata</b> Object Description Schema (MODS), Z39.50 and Search/Retrieve Web Service (SRW), and Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU).|$|E
25|$|Ogg Skeleton is {{emerging}} as the way to approach machineable <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
25|$|METSRights is an {{extension}} schema to the METS packaging <b>metadata</b> standard.|$|E
25|$|Extensible <b>Metadata</b> Platform (XMP) is an ISO standard, {{originally}} {{created by}} Adobe Systems Inc., for the creation, processing and interchange of standardized and custom <b>metadata</b> for digital documents and data sets. IPTC {{was developed in}} the early 1990s by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) to expedite the international exchange of news among newspapers and news agencies.|$|E
25|$|Continuous Media Markup Language: a text/application codec for timed <b>metadata,</b> captioning, and formatting.|$|E
25|$|All {{resources}} found from a query of the SafetyLit database {{are directly}} {{available to the}} free Zotero reference management software. Records may also be downloaded in RIS, ENW, and BibTeX formats for import into other software such as EndNote, Mendeley, Papers, etc. The <b>metadata</b> for each SafetyLit record is silently available in COinS, unAPI, and Google Scholar/Highwire Press <b>metadata</b> formats.|$|E
25|$|Ditto blocks: Configurable data {{replication}} per filesystem, with zero, {{one or two}} extra copies requested per write for user data, and with that same base number of copies plus one or two for <b>metadata</b> (according to <b>metadata</b> importance). If the pool has several devices, ZFS tries to replicate over different devices. Ditto blocks are primarily an additional protection against corrupted sectors, not against total disk failure.|$|E
25|$|File <b>metadata</b> is {{displayed}} in columns, including album, artist, beats per minute, bit rate, composer, date added, date modified, disc number, genre, last played, last skipped, plays, purchase date, size, skips, time, track number, year, {{and a few}} fields that may be supplied by users, such as description, kind, and rating. <b>Metadata</b> fields not loaded with the song, or added by a user, remain blank.|$|E
25|$|Windows Search uses {{property}} handlers {{to handle}} <b>metadata</b> from file formats. A property handler needs a property description and a schema {{for the property}} for Windows Search to index the <b>metadata.</b> Protocol handlers are used for indexing specific data stores. For example, files are accessed using File System Protocol Handler, Microsoft Office Outlook data stores using the Outlook Protocol Handler and Internet Explorer cache using the IE History/Cache Protocol Handler.|$|E
25|$|The <b>metadata</b> utility {{can read}} and write Nero Digital, iTunes, and Memory Stick format tags to MPEG-4 containers.|$|E
25|$|The privacy {{problem of}} Exif {{data can be}} avoided by {{removing}} the Exif data using a <b>metadata</b> removal tool.|$|E
25|$|The Exif tag {{structure}} is borrowed from TIFF files. On several image specific properties, {{there is a}} large overlap between the tags defined in the TIFF, Exif, TIFF/EP, and DCF standards. For descriptive <b>metadata,</b> there is an overlap between Exif, IPTC Information Interchange Model and XMP info, which also can be embedded in a JPEG file. The <b>Metadata</b> Working Group has guidelines on mapping tags between these standards.|$|E
25|$|Windows Photo Gallery is a {{photo and}} video library {{management}} application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom <b>metadata</b> {{based on the}} Extensible <b>Metadata</b> Platform. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, resizing, cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom <b>metadata</b> {{to be added to}} images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports raw image format natively and can open and organize any image format for which image codecs are installed in the Windows Imaging Component. Images and videos may be viewed in the Windows Photo Gallery Viewer with options to zoom, pan and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the Info pane to view and edit <b>metadata</b> about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The Photo Print Wizard has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, Windows Live Photo Gallery allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of Windows Live services.|$|E
25|$|The Ogg {{container}} format can multiplex {{a number}} of independent streams for audio, video, text (such as subtitles), and <b>metadata.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Version tab that {{appeared}} for binary files with version information in Windows XP and the Summary tab {{that appeared}} for all files on NTFS volumes have been combined {{into a single}} Details tab. If a Property handler is installed, the Details property sheet allows editing file <b>metadata</b> similar to the Details pane. Windows Explorer has built-in ability to remove any extra <b>metadata</b> associated with the file (Remove Properties and Personal Information).|$|E
25|$|The OS uses <b>metadata</b> to {{distinguish}} file formats. Some common file formats from other systems are mapped to filetypes by the MimeMap module.|$|E
25|$|As {{all stripes}} are of {{different}} sizes, RAID-Z reconstruction has to traverse the filesystem <b>metadata</b> {{to determine the}} actual RAID-Z geometry. This would be impossible if the filesystem and the RAID array were separate products, whereas it becomes feasible {{when there is an}} integrated view of the logical and physical structure of the data. Going through the <b>metadata</b> means that ZFS can validate every block against its 256-bit checksum as it goes, whereas traditional RAID products usually cannot do this.|$|E
