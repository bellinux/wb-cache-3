40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{mechanisms of}} <b>mercury</b> and <b>tin</b> organic derivatives {{are still under}} debate. Generally the presence of organic moieties in their molecules makes these compounds lipophilic and membrane active species. The recent results suggest that Hg and Sn compounds deplete HS-groups in proteins, glutathione and glutathione-dependent enzymatic systems; this process also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), the enhancement of membrane lipids peroxidation and damage of the antioxidative defence system. The goal of this review is to present recent results in the studies oriented towards the role of organomercury and organotin compounds in the xenobiotic-mediated enhancement of radical production and hence in the promotion of cell damage as a result of enhanced lipids peroxidation. Moreover the conception of the carbon to metal bond cleavage that leads to the generation of reactive organic radicals is discussed as one of the mechanisms of <b>mercury</b> and <b>tin</b> organic derivatives toxicity. The possible use of natural and synthetic antioxidants as detoxification agents is described.

40|$|Due {{to human}} activities, the {{concentrations}} of organometallic compounds {{in all parts of}} the environment have increased in recent decades. The toxicity and some biochemical properties of <b>mercury</b> and <b>tin</b> present in the environment depend on the concentration and chemical form of these two elements. The ever-increasing demand for determining compounds at very low concentration levels in samples with complex matrices requires the elimination of interfering substances, the reduction of the final extract volume, and analyte enrichment in order to employ a detection technique, which is characterised by high sensitivity at low limits of quantification. On the other hand, in accordance with current trends, the analytical procedures should aim at the miniaturisation and simplification of the sample preparation step. In the near future, more importance will be given to the fulfilment of the requirements of Green Chemistry and Green Analytical Chemistry in order to reduce the intensity of anthropogenic activities related to analytical laboratories. In this case, one can consider the use of solvent-free/solvent-less techniques for sample preparation and microextraction techniques, because the use of the latter leads to lowering the quantity of reagents used (including solvents) due to the reduction of the scale of analysis. This paper presents an overview of microextraction techniques (SPME and LPME) used in the procedures for determining different chemical forms of <b>mercury</b> and <b>tin...</b>|$|R

The first chapter introduces the technique of e. s. r. and covers the historical development of the technique, the relation of the electronic structure of the paramagnetic molecule to its experimental e. s. r. spectrum, factors effecting e. s. r. linewidths, experimental methods of e. s. r. and the interpretation of e. s. r. powder spectra.;The second chapter deals with the study of the electronic properties of impurity doped crystalline solids. The electronic structures of VK centres, silver atom and Ag 2 + complexes, formed in irradiated alkali halides, were determined by e. s. r. and their subsequent reactions, upon warming up the samples, were studied by both e. s. r. and thermoluminescence techniques. The significance of these results for silver doped alkali halide systems and for silver halide systems are discussed.;The third chapter deals with the properties of some paramagnetic ions of silver, <b>mercury,</b> <b>tin</b> and lead. The properties of silver atoms on a silica gel surface, mercury ions formed in frozen, irradiated, solutions of mercury salts, the ions Sn 3 + and Pb 3 + in irradiated, pure, tin and lead salts, lead centres in irradiated, hydrated and anhydrous, plumbous acetate and some unidentified paramagnetic centres are discussed. Chapter four deals with the properties of alkyl and phenyl complexes of tin and lead. The ion PbMe 2 +, trialkyl tin and trialkyl lead radicals, trimethyl and triphenyl lead halide anions and some other, related, paramagnetic tin centres are discussed.

Beverages may be alcoholic (wine, spirits, and beers) or non-alcoholic (soft drink, energy drinks, candies, chocolates, milks).
