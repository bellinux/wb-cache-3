Significant modifications included a double-articulated folding wing mechanism and a pusher engine. It still retained Ercoupe features, such as the twin tail and the center section. The first flight was in 1953, and the <b>model</b> <b>II</b> flew 65 hours. The Model III with a single wing-fold mechanism crashed in 1974, killing Bryan.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} to {{differentiate}} between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens, MINOX introduced an edge code in the negative. Since the MINOX C (the first camera released with the new minox lens) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera. The reason was that commercial processors used MINOX enlargers. As the minox lens replaced the complan, so the enlargers had to change lenses: MINOX II enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses, MINOX III enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses. Ironically, owners of Rigas and <b>model</b> <b>II</b> cameras would get better results from a MINOX III enlarger than a MINOX II enlarger.|$|E

The customers demand i. i. d. service times. Three different models are considered. In Model I, a customer who finds the server busy can be queued, whereas in <b>Models</b> <b>II</b> and III, any customer finding the server busy upon arrival will make repeated attempts to enter service until he eventually finds the server free. <b>Models</b> <b>II</b> and III differ in the retrial policy.

50|$|BASIC was {{provided}} on disk {{rather than in}} the system ROMs, partially to give the <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> a more professional and less of a home-computer appearance. The <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> BASIC was similar to Level III Disk BASIC on the Model I/III, but had cassette support removed and incorporated several enhancements from the then-latest version of Microsoft BASIC-80, which included enhanced string-handling features, an improved editor, octal number conversion, and error-trapping. On the downside, the PEEK and POKE commands were removed from <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> BASIC which made it less hacker-friendly. However, if CP/M was used, the user had access to MBASIC for CP/M which was very similar to <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> BASIC and did allow PEEK/POKE.|$|E

However, the Model II's video circuitry was significantly improved in the interest of better picture quality, as one of the criticisms of the Model I was that the included monitor was merely an RCA television set with the RF, IF, and sound stripped out. The <b>Model</b> <b>II,</b> in contrast, used a dedicated monochrome composite monitor with higher-quality and better-adjusted components than the modified TV set provided with the Model I. The text display on the <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> was 80x24 rather than the Model I/III's 64x16 text and also added lowercase letters, one major feature that the Model I was lacking. In addition, it could be operated in 40x24 text mode. The character set in the <b>Model</b> <b>II</b> was somewhat different from the Model I/III. It de-emphasized graphics characters and replaced them with additional currency and mathematical symbols.|$|E
