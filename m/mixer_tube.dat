One such concept is the Integrated Mixer-Flame Holder (IMFH). This report describes a series of IMFH analyses performed with KIVA-II, a multi-dimensional CFD code for problems involving sprays, turbulence, and combustion. To {{meet the needs of}} this study, KIVA-II's boundary condition and chemistry treatments are modified. The study itself examines the relationships between fuel vaporization, fuel-air mixing, and combustion. Parameters being considered include: <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> length, <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> geometry (converging-diverging versus straight walls), air inlet velocity, air inlet swirl angle, secondary air injection (dilution holes), fuel injection velocity, fuel injection angle, number of fuel injection ports, fuel spray cone angle, and fuel droplet size. Cases are run with and without combustion to examine the variations in fuel-air mixing and potential for flashback due to the above parameters. The degree of fuel-air mixing is judged by comparing average, minimum, and maximum fuel/air ratios at the exit of the <b>mixer</b> <b>tube,</b> while flame stability is monitored by following the location of the flame front as the solution progresses from ignition to steady state. Results indicate that fuel-air mixing can be enhanced by a variety of means, the best being a combination of air inlet swirl and a converging-diverging <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> geometry.

Two-dimensional exciplex fluorescence was used to characterize the degree of fuel vaporization and mixing at the combustor inlet under non-combusting conditions. These tests were conducted at a pressure of 4 atm., a temperature of 400 C, a <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> velocity of 100 m/sec and an equivalence ratio of. 8, using a mixture of tetradecane, 1 methyl naphthalene and TMPD as a fuel simulant. Fuel-air mixtures with two distinct spatial distributions were studied. The exciplex measurements showed that there was a significant amount of unvaporized fuel at the combustor entrance in both cases. One case, however, exhibited a very non-uniform distribution of fuel liquid and vapor at the combustor entrance, i. e., with most of the fuel in the upper half of the combustor tube, while in the other case, both the fuel liquid and vapor were much more uniformly distributed across the width of the combustor entrance. The lean limit and emissions measurements were all made at a pressure of 4 atm. and a <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> velocity of 100 m/sec, using Jet A fuel and both fuel-air mixture distributions. Contrary to what was expected, the better mixed case was found to have a substantially leaner operating limit.

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has become the mainstream approach for removing heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine NOx emissions. Highly efficient SCR systems are a key enabling technology allowing engines to be calibrated for very high NOx output with a resultant gain in fuel consumption while still maintaining NOx emissions compliance. One key to the successful implementation of high efficiency SCR at elevated engine out NOx levels is the ability to introduce significantly more AdBlue into the exhaust flow while still ensuring complete ammonia production and avoiding the formation of deposits. This paper presents a body of experimental work conducted on an exhaust test bench using optical techniques including high-speed imaging and phase Doppler interferometry (PDI), applied under representative exhaust conditions to a HD diesel engine after-treatment system with optical access inside the <b>mixer</b> <b>tube.</b> Two different sprays were used to dose AdBlue onto the mixing device. A three-hole injector and a single-hole pressure-swirl injector were characterised in ambient and heated exhaust flow conditions. A metallic two-stage mixer and an uncoated cordierite ceramic substrate mixer were compared and demonstrated the ability of the substrate mixer to reduce deposit formation at higher dosing rates inside the <b>mixer</b> <b>tube</b> when used with the correct spray type. High-speed imaging revealed the ability of the substrate to absorb injected AdBlue spray at cooler exhaust temperatures. However, using the incorrect spray can lead to liquid saturation inside the substrate channels, which is detrimental due to the formation of deposits on the rear face of the substrate...|$|E

Effective mixing of the digester contents is important for process stability, maximizing gas production, minimizing scum and foam formation, and preventing solids deposition in the digester.

With the concern regarding electrical power cost and the interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there is a renewed focus on reducing the power required for digester mixing.

The residence time section for the second reaction step is equipped with orifices for interfacial area renewal, needed for ensuring mass transfer between the two immiscible phases. The strong dependence of the reaction performance {{on the size of}} the interfacial area is demonstrated by using a setup with 4 orifices (distance of 52 cm), giving a HPLC yield of 71 ¿% at a residence time of 8 s and a reaction temperature of 23 ¿°C. A further shortening of orifice distances helped to shorten the residence time down to 1. 5 s and 0. 5 s (using 9 orifices and 3 orifices with a distance of 5 cm). When using these setups, the produced heat could not be removed from the system sufficiently quickly (¿T= 38 K). The achieved yields (ca. 70 ¿% by HPLC) are close to the state of the art (cascaded batch processing) and provide an indication that the tert-butyl peroxypivalate synthesis can be performed at higher temperatures or at least, a more flexible process control can be allowed compared to high-volume batch reactors. Processing at higher reaction temperatures up to 70 ¿°C shows a slight optimum at reaction temperatures between 40 ¿°C to 50 ¿°C, depending on the setup used.

This reactor is formed based on consecutive combination of the batched <b>mixer</b> and the <b>tube</b> furnace with flowing solution. The flow rate of this reactor was ca. 100 times larger than common microfluidics reactors. In order to synthesize high quality CIS/ZnS NCs, we adjusted the concentrations of reactants and the growing temperature. First, CIS core NCs were thermally grown at 210 °C for reaction times of 1  min and then ZnS shell overcoating was consecutively conducted via the thermolysis method (320 °C for 2  min). The resulting NCs were subsequently overcoated with a ZnS shell using a mixture of zinc acetate, oleic acid, 1 -dodecanethiol, and trioctylamine. During the shell growth, the PL quantum yield (QY) strongly increased to values of 20 % to 60 %. The resulting CIS/ZnS NCs exhibited emissions of yellow with a maximum quantum yield of 61.4 %. Both band gap and peak emission energies of CIS/ZnS core/shell NCs were substantially blueshifted compared to that of the original CIS core counterparts (red emission).

The new design uses the same premixer types as the stepped-dome design: integrated <b>mixer</b> flameholder (IMFH) <b>tubes</b> and a cyclone swirler pilot. The IMFH fuel system has been taken {{to a new level}} of development. Although the IMFH fuel system design developed in this Task is not intended to be engine-like hardware, it does have certain characteristics of engine hardware, including separate fuel circuits for each of the fuel stages. The four main stage fuel circuits are integrated into a single system which can be withdrawn from the combustor as a unit. Additionally, two new types of liner cooling have been designed. The resulting lean blowout data was found to correlate well with the Lefebvre parameter. As expected, CO and unburned hydrocarbons emissions were shown to have an approximately linear relationship, even though some scatter was present in the data, and the CO versus flame temperature data showed the typical cupped shape. Finally, the NOx emissions data was shown to agree well with a previously developed correlation based on emissions data from Configuration 3 tests performed at GEAE.

The amount of sewage sludge produced continues to be increased as the environmental regulations become more stringent and the treatment capacity of {{wastewater treatment}} plant enlarges. Therefore, treatment and disposal of sewage sludge becomes an important environmental issue. One of the environmentally acceptable treatment methods is the biological digestion to reduce the volume and to recycle the useful resource of the sewage sludge {{for the benefit of the}} community. Anaerobic sludge digestion has been commonly adopted because of several advantages such as the productions of methane as an energy resources and solids residue as a soil conditioner, reduction in mass and volume of sludge, and reduction of odor nuisance and pathogens. The anaerobic process is mainly controlled by the bacteria that are sensitive to pH, substrate composition, temperature and other factors. In order to provide a favorable environment for the microorganisms to survive, it is necessary to have efficient mixing in the anaerobic sludge digester. Three-dimensional (3 -D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to study the mixing in an egg-shaped anaerobic digester. The mixing is provided by a mechanical draft <b>tube</b> <b>mixer</b> and eight nozzles in the digester.

40|$|Powder mixing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a number of industries ranging from phar- maceuticals and food to ceramics and explosives. Given its fundamental technological im- portance [1, 2], surprisingly little is known about the basic kinematics of flowing and mixing granular materials. For instance, no theory can suggest the optimal method or time required to mix medicinal powders to a specified uniformity. To suggest why this is so, consider that from a theoretical viewpoint, mixing problems appear complex and unwieldy, while from an applied viewpoint, it is often expedient to focus on the details of particular cases without ever searching for underlying structure. As a step towards uncovering basic principles, it is clearly desirable to identify granular mixing problems admitting clean and focused experi- mentation together with a healthy measure of theoretical tractability. A quasi- two-dimensional disk partially filled with differently colored passive particles and rotating about its axis seems to satisfy these requirements. This geometry could be con- sidered a two-dimensional <b>tube</b> or drum <b>mixer.</b> Because of their industrial use and because they display axial segregation bands, many people have considered three-dimensional <b>tube</b> <b>mixers.</b> To our knowledge only Hogg et al. [3 J have previously considered transverse mixing in the cross-section of a tube. Here we report the results of experiments and a model based only on geometric considerations. Comparison of mixing patterns from experiment and the simulated model shows excellent agreement. Moreover, we can predict with the model and measure mixing rates and (with differently sized particles) demixing rates as a function of the fill level f in the disk. Experimentally, the disk is thin enough for the dynamics to occur in a plane and be visually apparent. The particles are dyed table salt, which are cubes with a mean side length of 0. 5 mm. When we wish to provoke segregation, the particles are a mixture of salt and sugar balls, which have a size ratio of 1 / 5. As the cell rotates, the flat material surface rotates until it reaches an angle Of M 60 &# 0176;, at which point the static equilibrium of the particles fails and an avalanche occurs. After the avalanche the surface returns to its angle of repose 8, M 52 ". The rotation speed is slow enough so that avalanche motion ceases completely before the next avalanche begins. Note that the rotation of the disk is steady, but the motion of the surface, which causes mixing, is iterative. This is important to our being able to reduce the dynamics of the mixing to a map. We call the flow quasi-two-dimensional because, even though individual particles may move between the front and back bounding surfaces as the particles avalanche down the surface, we observe through the front and back glass covers that the macroscopic structures-boundaries, streaks, and core-extend entirely through the material layer. While individual grains in the experiment may take a three-dimensional path during an avalanche, large-scale structures remain planar. 17 The basis of the geometric model is to notice that the angles Of and 8, define a wedge. To the extent that the surface can be considered a straight line, it is the material inside this wedge that the avalanche takes from one side of the container to the other. As a first ap- proximation the motion of grains is modeled as taking the upper surface wedge and flipping it across the center line. The mixing is accomplished by a mathematical map of the wedge into itself. The results to date have used both a random map, i. e. the points in the wedge are rearranged randomly, and a simple deterministic map. Other maps could be devised to more closely probe the mixing dynamics, but the simple random map does a surprisingly good job. The geometric reasoning is not limited to circular domains. Based only on an examination of the geometry of wedges and their intersections, several predictions can be made. (1) Mixing should be faster for lower fill levels for f 1 / 2 +E whose fractional area grows as f 2 and where E is the size of the surface boundary layer. Each prediction of the model is testable and is found qualitatively in the experiments. Mixing rates are determined by tracking the positions of the centroids of the colors. The centroid positions are normalized (for both experiment and computation) to that of the whole material so each centroid starts one unit from the overall center of mass. When the material is perfectly mixed, the color centroids coincide with each other at the origin. The centroids&# 8217; orbits oscillate and decay exponentially. The decay time-constant 7 and oscillation period are measured as a function off. The simulations verify the predictions from geometric reasoning: mixing is fast for lower f and decreases to near zero at f = l/ 2, though the calculated mixing rates are consistently higher than those measured from the experiment. As a practical matter we would like to know how efficient a powder mixer a rotating disk might be. The area mixed is A(f), where A is the area of the disk and without loss of generality we may take A = 1. The characteristic mixing time (in units of revolutions) is l/y. The most efficient operation point is that which maximizes rA(f) the area mixed per time. The maximum efficiency measured efficiency of O. $A/revolution occurs around f = 0. 2. The mixing flow in the thin drum is asymmetric with in principle a large number of de- grees of freedom. It is extraordinary that so simple a model based only on geometry does so well. For the subject of granular solids mixing the quasi-two-dimensional mixer is an excel- lent system with which to make precise measurements and physically motivated models...|$|R
