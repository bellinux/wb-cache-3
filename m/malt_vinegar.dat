500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, <b>malt</b> <b>vinegar,</b> bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
