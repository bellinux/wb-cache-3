5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things,</b> to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game was one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called it possibly the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ {{was the most important thing}} to happen to PC gaming in 2012.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> {{about the}} fantastical creatures carved of wood {{is that every}} piece is removable, it's how you can tell you have a piece carved {{by one of the}} {{original}} great carvers. The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> to {{take into}} {{consideration}} when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work so well and how to improve scenarios.|$|E

[...] But he also declared The Lady with the Dog [...] "one of the greatest stories ever written" [...] in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing [...] "the way one person relates to another the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Madgwick {{was born}} on 10 May 1905 in North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He was the second of three sons of Australian-born parents Richard Charlton Madgwick and Annie Jane Elston. Madgwick's father was a tram-driver in Sydney and his mother a dressmaker. Both were active members of an Anglican church. Madgwick stated later that his parents taught him that, [...] "all {{men and women were}} sacred, and poverty and {{injustice}} were in some way contrary to God's teaching." [...] Madgwick described the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> in his young life as family, church, and school.|$|E

According to Shindo, {{although}} Mizoguchi made more than eighty films, {{most of them were}} boring, with only about five or six good films, but without the failures there would never have been successes like Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|R

500|$|Interviewed at {{the time}} of the album's release, Nicky Wire said that the track [...] "Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit'sworldwouldfallapart" [...] was [...] "not a {{completely}} anti-American song", but instead was about [...] "how the most empty culture in the world can dominate in such a total sense". [...] "Of Walking Abortion" [...] is about right-wing totalitarianism, of which Wire commented: [...] "there's a worm in human nature that makes us want to be dominated". [...] "Archives of Pain", dealing with the glorification of serial killers and seemingly advocating capital punishment, he said [...] "was the song that me and Richey worried about most [...] the song isn't a right wing statement, it's just against this fascination with people who kill". Later in 1994, Bradfield described the song as [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> we've done" [...] but said it was also [...] "very right-wing" [...] and [...] "miscalculated".|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> in life. He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
