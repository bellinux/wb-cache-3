40|$|Motor {{intentional}} {{disorders in}} right hemisphere stroke 2 / 23 2 Objective: Damage to premotor and prefrontal regions results in motor intentional disorders (<b>MIDs)</b> that disrupt initiation, maintenance, and termination of volitional movements. <b>MIDs</b> occur more frequently after right than left hemisphere injury. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the prevalence of <b>MIDs</b> in patients with right hemisphere stroke and the factors that have influence on <b>MIDs.</b> Methods: Subjects consisted of 25 consecutive patients with right hemisphere stroke and 12 normal controls. They underwent a series of experiments using force dynamometer along with bedside examination. Results: It was identified that the force control test screened for <b>MIDs</b> with a higher sensitivity than bedside exams: motor akinesia (38 % vs. 11 %), motor impersistence (50 % vs. 10 %), and motor perseveration (47 % vs. 25 %). The patients were significantly inferior to the controls in terms of force control capabilities in the four force control phases (1. 6 - 17. 0 times). The location and area of lesion and space of force production were not related to the severity of <b>MIDs</b> whereas the presence of neglect was related to the severity of <b>MIDs.</b> Conclusions: Our results suggest force dynamometer is a sensitive method to detect <b>MIDs</b> and the presence of neglect may influence the frequency of <b>MIDs...</b>|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. August 2013. Major: Microbial Engineering. Advisor: Igor G. Libourel. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 96 pages, appendices A-D. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) {{is a technique}} used to elucidate intracellular reaction rates (fluxes) in a metabolic network. Intracellular fluxes are determined by providing substrate enriched with stable, heavy isotopic label and subsequently measuring the incorporation of label into metabolic end products. This results in metabolic end products consisting of isomers of discrete mass states, termed isotopomers. The resulting isotopomer distributions (<b>MIDs)</b> for each metabolic end product are then used to infer fluxes. Typically, metabolic end products used for MFA are derivatized protein-bound amino acids. Protein is extracted from the sample and hydrolyzed into constitutive amino acids, resulting in a amino acid pools derived from all cellular protein. Each amino acid pool contains amino acids potentially synthesized from different subcellular compartments, subspecies within a culture, or from different time points within the cell cycle. Thus, fluxes inferred from hydrolyzed total protein lack spatial and temporal resolution. However, if amino acid <b>MIDs</b> were to be measured directly from individual proteins, one could derive the fluxes {{at the time and}} place for which that particular protein was synthesized. Therefore, obtaining amino acid <b>MIDs</b> from individual proteins could enable spatial and temporal resolution for metabolic flux analysis. One solution would be to purify individual protein and hydrolyze and measure amino acid <b>MIDs.</b> This approach would require a significant amount of protein, is manually intensive and expensive. A much more viable solution utilizes high-throughput and high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify and identify peptide <b>MIDs,</b> which can be used to infer constitutive amino acid <b>MIDs.</b> However, there is no well-defined, automated framework for the extraction and quantification of peptide <b>MIDs</b> from raw mass spectra. In the first chapter, the conceptual framework and vocabulary need for mass spectrometry and peptide-based MFA are provided, with a statistical emphasis. Chapter 2 provides a review of proteomics instrumentation for peptide based MFA followed by the algorithmic considerations and potential software solutions available for the extraction of peptide <b>MIDs.</b> Chapter 3 will describe the methods developed for the automated extraction and quantification of isotopically enriched peptides, including parameter optimization of existing methods and description of novel clustering and quantification methods. Chapter 4 describes the validation of the methods using three different sets of labeled peptide <b>MIDs.</b> Chapter 5 provides a brief discussion of method and software improvements for both identification and quantification followed by a brief discussion of future work...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Used {{extensively}} in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, Medical Imaging Devices (<b>MIDs),</b> such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) machines, {{play an important role}} in medicine today. <b>MIDs</b> are increasingly connected to hospital networks, making them vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting the devices' infrastructure and components, which can disrupt digital patient records, and potentially jeopardize patients' health. Attacks on <b>MIDs</b> are likely to increase, as attackers' skills improve and the number of unpatched devices with known vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited grows. Attackers may also block access to <b>MIDs</b> or disable them, as part of ransomware attacks, which have been shown to be successful against hospitals. Method and Materials: We conducted a comprehensive risk analysis survey at the Malware-Lab, based on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model, in collaboration with our country's largest health maintenance organization, to define the characteristics of cyber-attacks on <b>MIDs.</b> The survey includes a range of vulnerabilities and potential attacks aimed at <b>MIDs,</b> medical and imaging information systems, and medical protocols and standards such as DICOM and HL 7. Results: Based on our survey, we found that CT devices face the greatest risk of cyber-attack, due to their pivotal role in acute care imaging. Thus, we identified several possible attack vectors that target the infrastructure and functionality of CT devices, which can cause: 1. Disruption of the parameters' values used in the scanning protocols within the CT devices (e. g., tampering with the radiation exposure levels); 2. Mechanical disruption of the CT device (e. g., changing the pitch); 3. Disruption of the tomography scan signals constructing the digital images; and 4. Denial-of-Service attacks against the CT device. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
