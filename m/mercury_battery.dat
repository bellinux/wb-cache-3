5|$|The <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, {{a primary}} cell, that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E

25|$|Implantable {{pacemakers}} {{constructed by}} engineer Wilson Greatbatch entered use in humans from April 1960 following extensive animal testing. The Greatbatch innovation varied {{from the earlier}} Swedish devices in using primary cells (<b>mercury</b> <b>battery)</b> as the energy source. The first patient lived for a further 18 months.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> {{were much}} used as {{convenient}} voltage references especially in portable instruments such as photographic light meters; <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> {{had a very}} stable discharge voltage over their useful life.|$|R
50|$|The {{power supply}} for the {{instrumentation}} {{was provided by}} <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R

25|$|Minox BL uses a PX625 button cell {{to power}} the CdS {{exposure}} meter; Minox C, LX, EC, used a 5.6v PX27 <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> {{to power the}} exposure meter and electromagnetic shutter. TLX, CLX, ECX use four 1.5v 386 silver oxide button cell in an adapter; this adapter combo {{can also be used}} to replace the discontinued 5.6v PX27 battery for Minox C, LX and EC.|$|E
25|$|The {{preceding}} implantable devices all {{suffered from}} the unreliability and short lifetime of the available primary cell technology which was mainly that of the <b>mercury</b> <b>battery.</b> In the late 1960s, several companies, including ARCO in the USA, developed isotope-powered pacemakers, but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the lithium iodide cell by Wilson Greatbatch. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} some {{instances}} that a hearing aid uses a rechargeable battery or a long-life disposable battery, the majority of modern hearing aids use one of five standard button cell zinc–air batteries. (Older hearing aids often used <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> cells, but these cells have become banned in most countries today.) Modern hearing aid button cell types are typically referred to by their common number name or {{the color of their}} packaging.|$|E
50|$|For a {{time during}} and after World War II, <b>batteries</b> made with <b>mercury</b> became a popular power source for {{portable}} electronic devices. Due {{to the content of}} toxic mercury and environmental concerns about its disposal, the sale of <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> is now banned in many countries. Both ANSI and IEC have withdrawn their standards for <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Powering the {{electro-mechanical}} shutter {{and light}} meter were two PX 625 1.35 volt <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> using a mercury(II) oxide cathode {{have a very}} flat {{discharge}} curve, holding constant 1.35 V (open circuit) voltage {{until about}} the last 5% of their lifetime, when their voltage drops rapidly. The voltage remains within 1% for several years at light load, and over a wide temperature range, making <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> useful as a voltage reference in electronic instruments and in photographic light meters.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{types of}} battery have been commercialized and {{represent}} an important practical application of electrochemistry. Early wet cells powered the first telegraph and telephone systems, {{and were the}} source of current for electroplating. The zinc-manganese dioxide dry cell was the first portable, non-spillable battery type that made flashlights and other portable devices practical. [...] The <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> using zinc and mercuric oxide provided higher levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury pollution from discarded cells.|$|E

50|$|In 1942 {{inventor}} Samuel Ruben with Mallory {{developed a}} practical balanced form of <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> {{which was used}} for portable electronic equipment during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} batteries, a silver oxide battery {{has a higher}} open circuit {{potential}} than a <b>mercury</b> <b>battery,</b> and a flatter discharge curve than a standard alkaline battery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> with cathodes {{made of a}} mix of {{mercuric oxide}} and {{manganese}} dioxide have output voltage of 1.4 V and a more sloped discharge curve.|$|R
5000|$|The {{uncontaminated}} {{mercury in}} the sealed glass vials has a modest salvage value; worn-out fluorescent tubes, <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries,</b> and <b>mercury</b> thermometers are often {{collected at the}} same locations for recycling.|$|R
50|$|Zinc-air {{batteries}} {{can be used}} {{to replace}} now discontinued 1.35 V <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> (although with a significantly shorter operating life), which in the 1970s through 1980s were commonly used in photo cameras.|$|R
50|$|The Lynx 5000 was {{introduced}} in 1962. It was an upgrade to the Lynx 1000 and replaced the photovoltaic cell with a cadmium sulfide (CdS) photoresistor, requiring a <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> for the light meter.|$|E
50|$|The Electro 35 was {{designed}} to operate using a 5.6V <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> but these have now been banned due to environmental concerns. However, a 6V alkaline battery (PX28A or 4LR44) may be used, with a purchased adaptor.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the <b>mercury</b> <b>battery</b> has a {{life span}} of several years, {{compared}} to a few months for the alkaline battery. This degree of incorrect exposure is tolerable with negative colour or black-and-white films, but is more noticeable with slide films.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> of {{the same}} {{dimensions}} are no longer manufactured because of their toxicity. Former mercury cells such as the Mallory RM401, Duracell RM-401, IEC-MR1, etc. were supplanted by the alkaline Kodak KN.|$|R
50|$|It has the new Konica Bayonet II mount, {{which is}} also often called K/AR mount. PX675 type <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> are only needed for the light meter. Shutter speeds run from 1s to 1/1000 and B.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, in 1992 {{the state}} of New Jersey {{prohibited}} sales of <b>mercury</b> <b>batteries.</b> In 1996 the United States Congress passed the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act that prohibited further sale of mercury-containing batteries unless manufacturers provided a reclamation facility, effectively banning their sale.|$|R

50|$|Many {{users will}} use a 1.4-volt hearing aid battery or {{adapters}} with Schottky diodes that allow use of SR-44 battery with better results. A zinc-air replacement battery can also be used. This battery has the same voltage as the PX625 <b>mercury</b> <b>battery,</b> and therefore {{is seen as a}} viable replacement by many.|$|E
50|$|With over 100 inventions {{credited}} to him personally, {{one of the}} most important was the dry electrolytic aluminum capacitor, the solid-state magnesium/cupric sulfide rectifier (a device that converted regular household electric current for use in radios), and the vacuum tube relay, the quick heater vacuum tube, and the concept of a balanced-cell <b>mercury</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> were {{formerly}} {{made in this}} size. They {{had higher}} capacity than the then-standard carbon-zinc types, a nominal voltage of 8.4 volts, and very stable voltage. Once used in photographic and measuring instruments or long-life applications, {{they are no longer}} manufactured as mercury is an environmental pollutant.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> {{use either}} pure mercury(II) oxide (HgO)—also called mercuric oxide—or {{a mixture of}} HgO with {{manganese}} dioxide (MnO2) as the cathode. Mercuric oxide is a non-conductor, so some graphite is mixed with it; the graphite also helps prevent collection of mercury into large droplets. The half-reaction at the cathode is: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>batteries</b> powered the {{high-power}} transmitter for 31 {{days and}} the low-power transmitter for 105 days. Explorer 1 stopped transmission of data on May 23, 1958 when its batteries died, but remained in orbit for more than 12 years. It reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean on March 31, 1970 after more than 58,000 orbits.|$|R
