500|$|Hay {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from {{the death of his}} son Adelbert, writing in 1904 to his close friend Lizzie Cameron that [...] "the death of our boy made <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> old, at once {{and for the rest of}} our lives". Gale described Hay in his final years as a [...] "saddened, slowly dying old man".|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait of <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, {{in the summer of}} 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I reckon we're goin' for them. 'Tain't likely <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> {{would want}} to pull up stakes at our age," [...] said the old man, sorrowfully.|$|E
5000|$|When Donnall Thomas {{was awarded}} a Nobel Prize in 1990 for the couple's work, he responded [...] "I'm pleased for <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> for my team and for the cancer center." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that is bad news," [...] said Umslopogaas, [...] "for know, Nada, I desire {{now that}} you should love me more than ever--that you should be <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> love <b>me</b> as your husband!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{am quite}} sure," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{it would have}} afforded as much {{satisfaction}} to you as it would to <b>my</b> dear <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> if we could only have had our sedate friend, Big Otter--" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{marriage}} {{was like the}} marriage of other people, and of no special interest to any one except <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> It took place at Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where her father was {{the manager of a}} bank. We were not very rich, having about 400 a year on which to live.|$|E
60|$|SHEMUS. I {{thought you}} were.... but that's no matter now-- There had been words between <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> Because I said I would be master here, And ask in what I pleased or who I pleased And so.... {{but that is}} nothing to the point, Because it's certain that you are but merchants.|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought you}} were ... but that's no matter now-- [...] There had been words between <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> [...] Because I said I would be master here, [...] And ask in what I pleased or who I pleased [...] And so.... but that is nothing to the point, [...] Because it's certain that you are but merchants.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so?" [...] said Kari. [...] "Well, learn, Master, {{that this}} prince is my brother, he whom I hate, he {{who has done}} me bitter wrong, he who stole away <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> {{poisoned}} <b>me.</b> Urco is his name. Does this lady Quilla love him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whilst you, my {{beautiful}} Suzanne," [...] he rejoined lightly, [...] "are mine ... irrevocably, irretrievably mine ... mine because I love you, {{and because you}} are <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> ... <b>and</b> owe <b>me</b> that obedience which you vowed to Heaven that you would give me.... That is so, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very well," [...] he returned, growing very serious. [...] "You {{know that}} as well as I do. You must know, dear Miss Starbrow, that I have admired you for a long time. Perhaps you also know that I love you. Miss Starbrow, will you be <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> make <b>me</b> happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will understand, Mr. Foster, {{that this}} has been a painful {{interview}} to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> You were our guest and my son's friend; but I do not know what has happened and we have no news of him. If you can bring him back, I will ask your forgiveness for all that I have said." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then John Caldigate {{wrote back}} as follows:--'All this that has befallen <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> {{prevents}} us from going anywhere. She {{is at the}} present moment with her own people at Chesterton, but when she returns I shall not leave her. Give my kindest love to Julia, and ask her from me to accept the little present which I send her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now Jenny was the {{youngest}} of our flock, and therefore, in a certain way, regarded by <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> as perennially [...] "the baby;" [...] and these little, old-fashioned, decisive ways of announcing her opinions seemed {{so much a part of}} her nature, so peculiarly [...] "Jennyish," [...] as I used to say, that my wife and I only exchanged amused glances over her head when they occurred.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} do you mean?" [...] roared out Rawdon; [...] "do {{you mean that}} you ever heard a fellow doubt about <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> didn't tell <b>me,</b> Mac?" ...|$|R
60|$|Great Scott! But {{here the}} girl turned and stomped {{off and the}} matter ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> family {{regarded}} <b>me</b> in wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want you}} to marry me. I {{want you to}} play the game of life with me as an honest woman should. Come <b>and</b> live with <b>me.</b> Be <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> squaw. Bear <b>me</b> children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} glad later, but not now! Gentlemen, I have asked my friends Aristides Homos and Eveleth Homos to {{accompany}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> this morning because Eveleth is an American, and will understand your position, {{and he has}} lately been in America and {{will be able to}} clarify the situation from both sides. We wish you to believe that we are approaching you in the friendliest spirit, and that nothing could be more painful to us than to seem inhospitable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dusante looked {{surprised}} and troubled, {{and he turned}} toward me. [...] "My dear sir," [...] said I, [...] "those two good women are very sensitive in regard to right and justice, and I {{think it will be}} well not to press this subject upon them. As for <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> neither of us would consent to touch money which was placed in that jar by Mrs. Lecks with the expectation that no one but you or one of your family would take it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very accommodating. We're immensely {{obliged to}} you; you must really {{let me say}} it. My wife has {{probably}} expressed to you what we feel. Touchett has been on our minds all winter; it has looked more than once {{as if he would}} never leave Rome. He ought never to have come; it's worse than an imprudence for people in that state to travel; it's a kind of indelicacy. I wouldn't for the world be under such an obligation to Touchett as he has been to--to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> Other people inevitably have to look after him, and every one isn't so generous as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall {{give me a}} fair open kiss, honestly, before I leave you,--in truth you shall. If {{you love}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> wish to be <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> intend <b>me</b> to {{understand}} that you and I are now pledged to each other beyond the power of any person to separate us by his advice, or any mother by her fears, give me a bold, honest kiss, and I will understand that it means all that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Barnes {{credits his}} being {{prescribed}} antidepressants with {{the making of}} the album. [...] "The real issue was a chemical thing, so when I finally got on medication, that balanced it out. So that helped me have a better perspective on things and helped my relationship with <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> helped <b>me</b> through [...]" [...] "Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse", the album's first single, chronicles his struggle with chemical imbalance and mood disorders.|$|R
50|$|Winston {{was born}} in Lexington, Mississippi, and raised in Greenville, Mississippi, where she {{attended}} local schools, which were segregated at the time. Leaving the South, she began her career onstage in New York City. Winston starred in the Broadway hit The Tap Dance Kid; she also appeared on Broadway in Two Gentlemen of Verona, I Love <b>My</b> <b>Wife,</b> <b>and</b> The <b>Me</b> Nobody Knows. She {{was a member of}} the Negro Ensemble Company.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll {{break into}} no house, sir. I {{give you my}} solemn word upon that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the {{necessary}} arrangements will have been made {{and he will be}} on his way to South America. For God's sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,--... So much said, I {{come with}} guilty speed to what more {{immediately}} concerns myself. Spare us {{a month or}} two for old sake's sake, and make <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> happy and proud. We are only fourteen days from San Francisco, just about a month from Liverpool; we have our new house almost finished. The thing can be done; I believe we can make you almost comfortable. It is the loveliest climate in the world, our political troubles seem near an end. It can be done, it must! Do, please, make a virtuous effort, come and take a glimpse of a new world I am sure you do not dream of, and some old friends who do often dream of your arrival.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was my desire, is my desire, {{to share}} with you what I have that is best; and that, I take it, is not the least {{valuable}} of my possessions, such as they are! And why not? You have given to me all that makes life sweet; without which it would be unbearable. That child who came to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> when I was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to us both. Had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments when my child was quivering between life and death, I would have cheerfully purchased them with not half but all! Sir, I should have given my soul! I can say this now, for gratitude is above all barter; and surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of his child!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did the law keep {{my family}} from bein' broke up by this devil? <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> left <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> own brother won't {{speak to me}} because I wouldn't say he was my Savior and my God." ...|$|R
60|$|CHR. Yes; <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> {{children}} saw <b>me</b> at the first, <b>and</b> {{called after}} <b>me</b> to turn again; also, {{some of my}} neighbours stood crying <b>and</b> calling after <b>me</b> to return; but I put my fingers in my ears, and so came on my way.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{do these}} things," [...] he said, [...] "because others do them; but I was bred a plain man at my father's frugal table, and I should like well would <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> family permit <b>me</b> {{to return to}} my sowens and my poor-man-of-mutton." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{same week}} Dr. Pusey died—a name that filled so large {{a space in}} the {{religious}} history of England for some thirty years of the century. Between Mr. Gladstone and him the old relations of affectionate friendship subsisted unbroken, notwithstanding the emancipation, as we may call it, of the statesman from maxims and principles, though not, so far as I know, {{from any of the}} leading dogmatic beliefs cherished by the divine. “I hope,” he wrote to Phillimore (Sept. 20, 1882), “to attend Dr. Pusey’s funeral to-morrow at Oxford.... I shall have another mournful office to discharge in attending the funeral of the Dean of Windsor, more mournful than the first. Dr. Pusey’s death is the ingathering of a ripe shock, and I go to his obsequies in token of deep respect and in memory of much kindness from him early in my life. But the death of Dean Wellesley is to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> an unexpected and very heavy blow, also to me an irreparable loss. I had honoured and loved him from Eton days.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} try if I were you. Were {{you in on}} a life {{sentence}} for murder, or still worse, as a political prisoner, I would say try if you like, for you would have nothing to lose; but you have a good prospect now. I am sure you must have been a political, but now that you have been a wanderer you are so no longer. You have won the governor's good-will, and as soon as your time is up, perhaps before, you will be allowed to live outside the prison. If you go away in the spring you will, when you return as winter comes on, forfeit all this, and have to begin again. When you come out there will be my little hut ready for you, and such a welcome from <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> that you will forget how small and rough it is, and there you will live with us till your five years are up, and you can go anywhere you like in Siberia." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{then gave}} the screw a half-turn more, {{and told him}} to walk and run. He started off, at first slowly, then he made long strides, then he began to run, and then to skip and jump. It had been many years since Mr. Gilbert had skipped and jumped. No one was in sight, and he was free to gambol as much as he pleased. [...] "Could you give it another turn?" [...] said he, {{bounding}} up to me. [...] "I want to try that wall." [...] I put on a little more negative gravity, and he vaulted over a five-foot wall with great ease. In an instant he had leaped back into the road, and in two bounds was at my side. [...] "I came down as light as a cat," [...] he said. [...] "There was never anything like it." [...] And away he went up the road, taking steps at least eight feet long, leaving <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> laughing heartily at the preternatural agility of our stout friend. In a few minutes he was with us again. [...] "Take it off," [...] he said. [...] "If I wear it any longer I shall want one myself, and then I shall be taken for a crazy man, and perhaps clapped into an asylum." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> {{approached}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> took <b>my</b> hand in hers, {{which was}} as cold as ice. [...] "Be strong and firm," [...] she said. [...] "A great danger threatens us, but you must brace yourself against it. Be strong and firm." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the words}} of Harriet Arbuthnot, {{who was in the}} Duke's carriage, 'Huskisson was caught by it, thrown down & the engine passed over his leg & thigh, {{crushing}} it in a most frightful way. It is impossible to give an idea of the scene that followed, of the horror of everyone present or of the piercing shrieks of his unfortunate wife, who was in the car. He said scarcely more than, [...] "It's all over with <b>me.</b> Bring <b>me</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> let <b>me</b> die.|$|R
40|$|Thank you for {{inviting}} me {{to be with you}} today. It is a real pleasure, and I look forward to visiting with you both individually and collectively, now and in the future. I 2 ̆ 7 d looked forward to meeting with you all earlier in the year, but a death in our family took <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> Virginia <b>and</b> <b>me</b> to Texas at the time of your April meeting, so I am very glad to have this opportunity to be with you now...|$|R
