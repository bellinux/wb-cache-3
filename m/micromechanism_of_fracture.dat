Evidence of both cracking and debonding of M-A phase and carbides was found, and many of the cracks appeared to develop by linking-up of voids resulting from debonding. The importance of the dihedral angle, 2 θ, in determining the interfacial energy of the two main morphologies of the M-A phase, blocky and elongated stringer particles, was considered.

This involved reheating to 1350 degrees C, rapid cooling (Delta t(8 / 5) = 24 s) to room temperature and then reheating to either 750 degrees C or 800 degrees C. The toughness of the HAZs was assessed using both Charpy and CTOD tests. Microstructural features were characterised by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Fractographic examinations of the Charpy and CTOD specimens were carried out to understand the <b>micromechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> under different microstructural and test conditions. The CGHAZ toughness was similar for the steels except that Steel C-Mn- 0. 05 V had a slightly lower ITT {{compared to the other}}s.

Raising the level of vanadium to 0. 11 % caused a decrease in ICCGHAZ toughness. Steel C-Mn-Nb exhibited a greater degradation of impact toughness after the intercritical cycles. The presence of M-A constituents was the dominant factor in determining the toughness of the ICCGHAZs. The size and area fraction of the M-A constituents were the smallest in Steel C-Mn- 0. 05 V. Increasing vanadium level to 0. 11 % resulted in a greater area fraction of the M-A constituents, larger average and maximum sizes of M-A particles, and significantly more fields containing the M-A.

40|$|AbstractCharacterization of {{materials}} requires {{a large number}} of experimental tests with various loading modes {{in order to ensure that}} it meets the design requirements. The aim of his work is to develop a numerical model to predict the behaviour of cracked panels, in place of expensive and complex experiments to generate data for designers. In particular, the model has to simulate toughness test and fatigue crack propagation at high level of ΔK for a wide variety of metallic alloys including aluminium alloys, titanium alloys and steels. The proposed model is based on a thermodynamic approach within the framework of Continuum Damage Mechanics which provides numerical robustness as well as a precise description of the physical <b>micromechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture.</b> An extension of a classical CDM approach, named Lemaitre model [1], is presented in this paper. Lemaitre model [1], which has been shown to be particularly well suited to describe ductile damage under monotonic loading, has been only applied separately to low cycle fatigue and high cycle fatigue. The extension has to simulate fatigue crack propagation. Experimental results have evidenced that the role of two distinct mechanisms in the high fatigue crack growth rate regime. In order to account for the different mechanisms involved in fatigue crack propagation test two damage variables are introduced in the Lemaitre model [1]. The first variable, called static damage, represents the damage variable associated with ductile fracture modes. While the static damage evolution law is consistent with the classical Lemaitre model [1], the second variable is assumed as a consequence of cumulated plastic strain and does not influence plasticity. It is named cyclic damage. Then, to correctly predict fatigue crack propagation rates, an internal length has to be defined. An energetic equivalence criterion has been inserted to model crack propagation and to reduce mesh dependence. This method, originally developed by J. Mazars and G. Pijaudier-Cabot [2], fills the gap between damage and fracture and avoids the introduction of additional boundary conditions or complex code developments associated with non-locality. The damage law coefficients have been calculated by taking into account the size of the elements. This model has been implemented in the commercial finite element code ABAQUS/CAE. Explicit computations have been performed to highlight drawbacks and advantages of the method...|$|E
40|$|This work {{contributes}} to the fundamental understanding of fracture properties of Particle Reinforced Metal Matrix Composites (PRMMCs), by identifying the key microstructural parameters that control fracture. To this end, PRMMCs with a high volume fraction of ceramic reinforcement (40 - 60 vol. %) are produced by gas-pressure infiltration. These composites are considered as model ductile/brittle twophase materials in that (i) : the particles are homogeneously distributed in the matrix, (ii) : the matrix microstructure is kept simple, and (iii) the composites are free of processing defects. The reinforcements used are alumina (Al 2 O 3) particles of various shape (angular, polygonal) and size (5 to 60 µm), and boron carbide (B 4 C) particles (5 to 60 µm). The matrix materials are (i) : pure Al, (ii) : Al-Cu 2 % alloy, and (iii) : Al-Cu 4. 5 % alloy, all being chosen {{in order to obtain}} a single-phase matrix (Cu in solid-solution for the Al-Cu alloys), and to minimize chemical reactivity with the reinforcement. Pure Al matrix composites exhibit marked R-curve behaviour; they are characterized by J-integral fracture testing. The fracture toughness increases with the interparticle distance. At a given particle size, polygonal Al 2 O 3 particle composites are the toughest, followed by B 4 C particle composites, and by angular Al 2 O 3 particle composites. Al-Cu matrix composites feature a flatter R-curve, and are tested by a Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) method: the chevron-notch test. Again, polygonal particles yield tougher composites than angular ones. In the as-cast condition, coarse intermetallics formed at the interface matrix/reinforcement during solidification are strongly detrimental to the toughness. After heat-treatment, on the other hand, toughness of the alloyed matrix composites is improved and increases as the matrix is strengthened by raising the Cu content in the matrix. Using an arrested-crack technique, it is found that the dominant micromechanisms of fracture of pure Al matrix composites are strongly dependent on the particle type, shape and size: the stronger the reinforcement, the more the crack tends to propagate by a ductile mechanism of nucleation, growth, and coalescence of micro-cavities. With weaker particles, cracking of the composite is promoted by premature particle cracking. A stereoscopic method coupled with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging is used to reconstruct the fracture surfaces in 3 D. The final dimple size (diameter, depth) is found to depend on the microstructural length scale of the composites, i. e. the interparticle distance. Data obtained from two types of measurement (quantitative metallography, dimple depth) are used to estimate the local energy necessary to create the fracture profile, by using simple micromechanical models. At the global scale, surface strain fields are revealed by photoelasticity. The observed crack-tip strain fields are fully confirmed by 3 D Finite Element (FE) computations. Although most of the fracture energy is spent in the plastic zone, it is shown that toughness is controlled by the local fracture energy that is dissipated in the crack-tip process zone: the macroscopic fracture toughness is an "amplification" of the local fracture energy. This simple and linear correlation breaks down when, for a given ceramic particle type and size, a transition in the dominant <b>micromechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> occurs as the matrix is strengthened. The local/global correlation is discussed in more detail, using a simplified approach based on the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) for ductile fracture: the fundamental parameters allowing to achieve attractive toughness are identified as: (i) the intrinsic particle strength, and (ii) the high local stress triaxiality between the closely spaced particles, made possible by the strong interfacial bonds between matrix and reinforcement. Overall, the composites feature very high toughness for materials made of up to 60 vol. % of brittle phase. The toughest pure Al matrix composites feature a KJeq as high as 40 MPa·m 1 / 2. For Al-Cu matrix composites, KIv (the plane-strain chevron notch fracture toughness) exceeds 30 MPa·m 1 / 2 (a value, to our knowledge, never reported for this class of materials) together with a Young's modulus of 180 GPa, a yield strength of 400 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength approaching 500 MPa.

The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a method for the suppression of damage growth in CFRP laminates. It is certified that one of the key technologies is bonding properties between SMA foils and CFRP laminates. In this paper, improvement of bonding properties between SMA foils and CFRP and confirmation of suppression effects of damage growth are described. Some surface treatments (sol-gel method, anodic-oxidation method and spattering method) were performed on SMA foils. Then, peel resistance and single lap shear strength tests were performed using surface treated SMA foils. It was found that treatment by 10 %NaOH is the most effective treatment for improvement of bonding properties. The treated surface was found porous and rough, which is supposed to provide anchoring effects of SMA/CFRP interfaces.

The <b>micromechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> have been investigated {{by a combination of}} fractographic and dynamic techniques. Matched fracture halves have been obtained from the composites and the fracture processes elucidated. Fracture proceeded by a ductile void nucleation, growth and coalescence mechanism. Void nucleation occurred at the reinforcing phase, with a change in nucleation mechanism on varying the micrstructural parameters. A simple critical stress criterion has been proposed for the nucleation process. Support for this proposal has been obtained by the study of sections through the failed tensile specimens. In situ scanning electron microscopy fracture studies have been performed. These revealed void nucleation before the onset of macroscopic cracking. Crack propagation has been shown to occur by the concurrent formation of microcracks ahead of the crack tip and failure of the joining matrix ligaments. The magnitude of matrix deformation has been shown {{to determine the extent of}} microcracking. Acoustic emissions have been monitored during tensile straining. Void nucleation events have been recorded from the onset of plastic deformation and continuing throughout the plastic régime until final failure.

More precisely, we have developed new extensions of a Gurson-type constitutive model describing the growth and coalescence of spheroidal voids, possibly not oriented parallel to the main loading direction. These extensions are essentially (i) a description of the void rotation and deformation under shear, (ii) a generalization of the Thomason criterion for the onset of coalescence accounting for the localization plane orientation, (iii) a new geometrical model for the internal necking process. The full model has been implemented in a home-made finite element code and validated towards finite element unit-cell calculations. Based on this model, we have investigated the influence of the microstructural features of homogeneous metallic materials on the different fracture mechanics parameters characterizing the fracture resistance such as JIc, CTOD, CTOA, plastic zone size, and JR. The multiscale modelling tool developed has been also applied to heterogeneous alloys with a specific focus on 7 xxx aluminium alloys involving precipitate free zones along the grain boundaries and displaying a competition between transgranular and intergranular fracture modes. The study has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the effect of the microstructural features, flow properties of the grain, and loading conditions on the preferential fracture mode, fracture strain tearing resistance, and crack path.

40|$|After {{pointing}} out {{many of the}} complexities that attend high temperature metal fatigue beyond those already studied in the sub-creep range, a description <b>of</b> the <b>micromechanisms</b> <b>of</b> deformation and <b>fracture</b> is presented for several classes of materials that were studied over the past dozen years. Strainrange Partitioning (SRP) {{is used as a}} framework for interpreting the results. Several generic types of behavior were observed with regard both to deformation and fracture and each is discussed in the context <b>of</b> the <b>micromechanisms</b> involved. Treatment <b>of</b> cumulative fatigue damage and the possibility of ""healing'' of damage in successive loading loops, has led to a new interpretation of the Interaction Damage Rule of SRP. Using the concept of ""equivalent micromechanistic damage'' [...] that the same damage on a microscopic scale is induced if the same hysteresis loops are generated, element for element [...] it turns out the Interaction Damage Rule essentially compounds a number of variants of hysteresis loops, all of which have the same damage according to SRP concepts, into a set of loops each containing only one of the generic SRP strainranges. Thus the damage associcated with complex loops comprising several types of strainrange is analyzed by considering a combination of loops each containing only one type of strainrange. This concept is expanded to show how several independent loops can combine to ""heal'' creep damage in a complex loading history...|$|R

Chemical composition of individual meltages was regulated alternatively by ferrosilicon (FeSi) and carburizer or metallurgical silicon carbide (SiC). The paper shows that SiC additive positively influences the microstructure, mechanical properties and <b>micromechanisms</b> <b>of</b> failure of nodular cast iron, {{especially in the}} meltages with higher ratio of steel scrap in the charge. Moreover, production of synthetic nodular cast irons with SiC additive is economically advantageous...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{work the}} change in fracture for the Al- 12 Al 4 C 3 system was investigated and analysed at temperatures from 20 to 400 °C and strain rates from 2. 5 · 10 – 5 to 10 – 1 s– 1. At room temperature 20 °C, during tensile testing at strain rates in the tested region, the strain is first controlled by work hardening, expressed by the exponent n. In the second generally smaller part the deformation is limited by local straining and forming the neck. There is a marked decrease of plastic properties for the strain rate ε & = 2. 5 · 10 – 5 s– 1 {{with the growth of}} temperature in the investigated region. It is explained by changes in the <b>micromechanism</b> <b>of</b> deformation and <b>fracture.</b> Fracture surface shows the transition from ductile fracture with dimples at 20 °C, to intercrystalline fractures, with the growth of the temperature, an indication of exhausted grain boundary plasticity. The intercrystalline fracture initiation tends, it is supposed, to be localized in triple points. At temperatures 400 °C, and ε & = 10 – 1 s– 1 there is a marked growth of plastic properties. The first part of the strain characterized by work hardening is very short. After the short growth of the stress to maximum, a deformation mechanism, showing presence of thermally and mechanically activated dynamic recovery processes takes place. The strain is this way uniform all over the body of the test piece. The fracture process ends with the increase of cavities and transcrystalline fracture with deep pimples...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} mechanical behavior of metallic glasses (MGs) was made over the past decade, particularly on mechanisms of plastic deformation. However, recent research thrust has been on exploring the mechanics and physics <b>of</b> <b>fracture.</b> MGs can be very brittle with K-Ic values similar to silicate glasses and ceramics or very tough with K-Ic akin to high toughness crystalline metals. Even the tough MGs can become brittle with structural relaxation following annealing at temperatures close to glass transition temperature (T-g). Detailed experimental studies coupled with complementary numerical simulations of the recent past have provided insights on the <b>micromechanisms</b> <b>of</b> failure as well as nature of crack tip fields, and established the governing fracture criteria for ductile and brittle glasses.
