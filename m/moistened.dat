Basal salt solutions and tap water resulted in higher LA production as compared to D/W alone. Enzyme production using Toyama’s salt solution (pH 5.0) was significantly higher than other <b>moistening</b> agents and it was therefore selected as the <b>moistening</b> agent in further experiments. Our studies are in line with the reports on LA production with <b>moistening</b> agent (distilled water) at acidic pH using Cladosporium sp. (Kumara et al. 2013).

30|$|In {{terms of}} time, the first {{interesting}} {{feature in the}} water budget was the large negative value of total tendency at 13 LST/ 06 UTC, as shown in Fig. 9 a. It was just {{before the onset of}} the convective heavy precipitation. The <b>moistening</b> was mostly dominated by <Q 2 >, as shown in Fig. 9 a. The vertical cross section of Q 2 (Fig. 9 d) indicates that the <b>moistening</b> occurred mostly in the lower troposphere (between 900 and 700  hPa). Previous studies demonstrated that environmental moisture strongly promotes the deepening of cumuliform convection (e.g., Sherwood 1999; Takemi et al. 2004). Similar preceding lower-tropospheric <b>moistening</b> in the diurnal cycle over land was also reported (e.g., Shinoda and Uyeda 2002). These findings strongly suggest that such <b>moistening</b> {{plays an important role in}} the diurnal cycle observed in the present study. The large contribution of Q 2 on the total <b>moistening</b> in the lower troposphere means that the <b>moistening</b> is associated with subarray-scale vertical transport of moisture. Later, we discuss the possible mechanisms promoting this <b>moistening.</b>|$|R

40|$|The role of {{convective}} {{processes in}} <b>moistening</b> the atmosphere during suppressed periods of the suppressed {{phase of a}} Madden-Julian oscillation is investigated in cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations, {{and the impact of}} <b>moistening</b> on the subsequent evolution of convection is assessed as part of a Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study (GCSS) intercomparison project. The ability of single-column model (SCM) versions of a number of state-of-the-art climate and numerical weather prediction models to capture these convective processes is also evaluated. During the suppressed periods, the CRMs are found to simulate a maximum <b>moistening</b> around 3 km, which is associated with a predominance of shallow convection. All SCMs produce adequate amounts of shallow convection during the suppressed periods, comparable to that seen in CRMs, but the relatively drier SCMs have higher precipitation rates than the relatively wetter SCMs and CRMs. The relatively drier SCMs dry, rather than <b>moisten,</b> the lower troposphere below the melting level. During the transition periods, convective processes act to <b>moisten</b> the atmosphere above the level at which mean advection changes from <b>moistening</b> to drying, despite an overall drying effect for the column. The SCMs capture some essence of this <b>moistening</b> at upper levels. A gradual transition from shallow to deep convection is simulated by the CRMs and the wetter SCMs during the transition periods, but the onset of deep convection is delayed in the drier SCMs. This results in lower precipitation rates for these SCMs during the active periods, although much better agreement exists between the models at this time...|$|R

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be <b>moistened</b> (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If <b>moistened,</b> these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when <b>moistened,</b> then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

40|$|The eastward-propagating intraseasonal {{oscillation}} {{represented by}} the Chikira-Sugiyama cumulus scheme in a general circulation model was investigated focusing on the variation of the free-tropospheric humidity. The net effect of the vertical advection and cloud process amplifies the positive moisture anomaly in the mature phase, supporting the moisture-mode theory. The horizontal advection causes the eastward propagation of the field. The variation of the moisture profile is accurately understood by using environmental vertical velocity outside cumuli. The velocity is regulated by a thermodynamic balance under a weak temperature gradient. A nondimensional parameter α {{plays an important role}} in the moisture variation, which characterizes the efficiency of <b>moistening</b> (drying) induced by external heating (cooling). In the middle and lower troposphere, the major <b>moistening</b> factor is the radiative warming anomaly, which induces the upward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. The reevaporation of the precipitation works as drying, since its cooling effect induces the downward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. Snow melting significantly cools and thereby dries the midtroposphere. The <b>moistening</b> of the midtroposphere is important for <b>moistening</b> the lower troposphere through the reduction of α. The efficiency of <b>moistening</b> depends on the heating profile, and congestus clouds play an important role in it. The heating profile, which maximizes the <b>moistening</b> of the free troposphere, is realized in the mature phase. The atmosphere is marginally unstable even in the mature phase, which is a favorable condition for the congestus clouds to occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{factors that}} control the {{influence}} of deep convective detrainment on water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere are examined using observations from multiple satellites {{in conjunction with a}} trajectory model. Deep convection is confirmed to act primarily as a moisture source to the upper troposphere, modulated by the ambient relative humidity (RH). Convective detrainment provides strong <b>moistening</b> at low RH and offsets drying due to subsidence across a wide range of RH. Strong day-to-day <b>moistening</b> and drying takes place most frequently in relatively dry transition zones where the frequency of deep convective events is neither very high nor very low. Many of these strong <b>moistening</b> events can be directly attributed to detrainment from recent tropical convection. The temporal and spatial limits of the convective source are estimated to be about 36 – 48 h and 600 – 1500 km, respectively, consistent with the lifetimes of detrainment cirrus clouds. Larger amounts of detrained ice and smaller ice particle sizes are both associated with enhanced upper tropospheric <b>moistening...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{theories}} for the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) {{focus on}} diabatic processes, particularly {{the evolution of}} vertical heating and <b>moistening.</b> Poor MJO performance in weather and climate models is often blamed on biases in these processes and their interactions with the large-scale circulation. We introduce one of three components of a model-evaluation project, which aims to connect MJO fidelity in models to their representations of several physical processes, focusing on diabatic heating and <b>moistening.</b> This component consists of 20 -day hindcasts, initialised daily during two MJO events in winter 2009 - 10. The 13 models exhibit a range of skill: several have accurate forecasts to 20 days' lead, while others perform similarly to statistical models (8 - 11 days). Models that maintain the observed MJO amplitude accurately predict propagation, but not vice versa. We find no link between hindcast fidelity and the precipitation-moisture relationship, in contrast to other recent studies. There is also no relationship between models' performance {{and the evolution of}} their diabatic-heating profiles with rain rate. A more robust association emerges between models' fidelity and net moistening: the highest-skill models show a clear transition from low-level <b>moistening</b> for light rainfall to mid-level <b>moistening</b> at moderate rainfall and upper-level <b>moistening</b> for heavy rainfall. The mid-level <b>moistening,</b> arising from both dynamics and physics, may be most important. Accurately representing many processes may be necessary, but not sufficient for capturing the MJO, which suggests that models fail to predict the MJO for a broad range of reasons and limits the possibility of finding a panacea...|$|R
