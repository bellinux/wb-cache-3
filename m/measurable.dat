5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a <b>measurable</b> space of functions, defining a suitable <b>measurable</b> mapping from a probability space to this <b>measurable</b> space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E

30|$|From {{the physics}} perspective, the <b>measurables</b> that remote sensing systems can {{directly}} acquire are all derived from sensor-reaching radiance and include the spectrally modified sunlight reflected from surface features, the emitted radiation from warm surfaces and the vertical locations of objects derived from laser or radio ranging systems. Second-order metrics are often inferred or modeled from these fundamental physics <b>measurables.</b> These secondary measures can include {{an estimate of}} fractional cover from multi-spectral data or object heights from structural (LiDAR) data. Tertiary metrics can include derived parameters used in applied problems such as assessments of carbon stocks and net primary productivity.|$|R
30|$|We {{propose that}} {{accurate}} prediction requires careful {{consideration of the}} interplay between the intrinsics of a process and the social dynamics which are its realization. We therefore adopt an inherently dynamical approach to predictive analysis: given a social process, a set of <b>measurables,</b> and the behavior of interest, we formulate prediction problems as questions about the reachability properties of the system. Toward that end, the behavior about which predictions are to be made is used to define the system state space subsets of interest (SSI), while the particular set of candidate <b>measurables</b> under consideration allows identification of the candidate starting set (CSS), that is, the set of states and system parameter values which represent initializations that are equivalent under the assumed observational capability. This setup permits predictability assessment, and the related task of identifying useful <b>measurables,</b> to be performed in a systematic manner. Roughly speaking, the proposed approach to predictability assessment involves determining how probable it is to reach the SSI from a CSS and deciding if these reachability properties are compatible with the prediction goals. If a system’s reachability characteristics are incompatible with the given prediction question – if, say, “hit” and “flop” in a cultural market are both likely to be reached from the CSS – then the prediction objectives should be refined in some way. Possible refinements include relaxing the level of detail to be predicted or introducing additional <b>measurables.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of rainfall by remote sensors is investigated. One parameter radar rainfall measurement is limited because both reflectivity and rain rate {{are dependent on}} at least two parameters of the drop size distribution (DSD), i. e., representative raindrop size and number concentration. A generalized rain parameter diagram is developed which includes a third distribution parameter, the breadth of the DSD, to better specify rain rate and all possible remote variables. Simulations show the improvement in accuracy attainable through the use of combinations of two and three remote <b>measurables.</b> The spectrum of remote <b>measurables</b> is reviewed.

5|$|The 2s {{electrons}} of beryllium {{may contribute}} to chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding.

5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} blocks continued even after their collision, generating strike-slip faults. The Saravan fault east of Taftan is one such fault; the 2013 Saravan earthquake occurred on this fault.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the quality of the PMS at the Estonian Ministry of Agriculture by ana-lyzing whether the PMS meets certain {{requirements}}. The requirements applicable to the PMS could be split into two categories: system requirements and measure requirements. The research particularly fo-cuses on the system requirements, such as balance, the cause-effect model, linkage to strategy, and multi-dimensionality. The authors use the archival research strategy in order to uncover the origins of the design of the current PMS and to describe the current state of affairs regarding PM in the public sector in Estonia. Secondary data, documentation publicly available from the web portals of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture of Estonia, is the main source of information. Content analysis is used to carry out the study of the current PMS of the ministry. Based on the analysis made we can conclude that although the <b>measurables</b> are not distributed homoge-neously among the categories, all the defined categories are covered. The PMS at the Ministry of Agricul-ture demonstrated a relatively good level of compliance with the requirements applicable to a modern PMS. However, the following recommendations are offered based on the results of the research:  split <b>measurables</b> in such a way that they would only represent a single area of performance,  review <b>measurables</b> that cannot be assigned to any of the defined categories,  consider improving the cause-effect model by separating inputs and outputs represented by actions...|$|R

Natural thorium consists of 0.02(2)% 230Th and 99.98(2)% 232Th; natural protactinium consists of 100% 231Pa; and natural uranium consists of 0.0054(5)% 234U, 0.7204(6)% 235U, and 99.2742(10)% 238U.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a <b>measurable</b> pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E

30|$|Intuitively, those <b>measurables</b> {{for which}} {{predictability}} is most sensitive {{are likely to}} be the ones that can most dramatically affect the predictability of a given problem. Note that we do not specify a particular measure of sensitivity to be used when identifying <b>measurables</b> with maximum predictive power, as such considerations are ordinarily application-dependent (see [39] for some useful specifications). Definitions A 2.1 and A 2.2 focus on the role played by initial states in the predictability of social processes. In some cases it is useful to expand this formulation to allow consideration of states other than initial states. For instance, we show in [18] that very early time series are often predictive for PEP, suggesting that it can be valuable to consider initial state trajectory segments, rather than just initial states, when assessing predictability. This extension can be naturally accomplished by redefining the CSS, for instance by augmenting the state space X with an explicit time coordinate [18].|$|R
50|$|Although {{oxidation}} numbers can {{be helpful}} for classifying compounds, they are unmeasurable and their physical meaning can be ambiguous. Oxidation numbers require particular caution for molecules where the bonding is covalent, since the oxidation numbers require the heterolytic removal of ligands, which in essence denies covalency. Spectroscopic oxidation states, as defined by Jorgenson and reiterated by Wieghardt, are <b>measurables</b> that are benchmarked using spectroscopic and crystallographic data.|$|R
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a <b>measurable</b> temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly <b>measurable</b> with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
