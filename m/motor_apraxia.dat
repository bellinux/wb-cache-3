50|$|Oculomotor apraxia (OMA), {{also known}} as Cogan ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> or saccadic {{initiation}} failure (SIF) is the absence or defect of controlled, voluntary, and purposeful eye movement. It was first described in 1952 by the American ophthalmologist David Glendenning Cogan. People with this condition have difficulty moving their eyes horizontally and moving them quickly. The main difficulty is in saccade initiation, {{but there is also}} impaired cancellation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Patients have to turn their head in order to compensate for the lack of eye movement initiation in order to follow an object or see objects in their peripheral vision, but they often exceed their target. There is controversy regarding whether OMA should be considered an apraxia, since apraxia is the inability to perform a learned or skilled motor action to command, and saccade initiation is neither a learned nor a skilled action.|$|E

Although a portion of cases with COMA were found to be associated with other abnormalities, COMA in most patients is an isolated disorder. The most charac-teristic appearance of these patients is compensatory head thrusts which usually become less evident with increasing age. Since Cogan first described COMA in 1952, many cases have been reported. The majority of these occurred sporadically with only a few exceptions. We report on 4 patients with COMA.

40|$|Although apraxia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} signs in corticobasal degeneration, the phenomenology of this disorder has not been formally examined. Hence 10 patients with corticobasal degeneration were studied with a standardised evaluation for different types of apraxia. To minimise the confounding effects of the primary <b>motor</b> disorder, <b>apraxia</b> was assessed in the least affected limb. Whereas none of the patients showed buccofacial apraxia, seven showed deficits on tests of ideomotor apraxia and movement imitation, four on tests of sequential arm movements (all of whom had ideomotor apraxia), and three on tests of ideational apraxia (all of whom had ideomotor apraxia). Ideomotor apraxia significantly correlated with deficit in both the mini mental state examination and in a task sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction (picture arrangement). Two of the three patients with ideomotor apraxia and ideational apraxia showed severe cognitive impairments. The alien limb behaviour was present only in patients with ideomotor apraxia. In conclusion, ideomotor apraxia is the most frequent type of apraxia in corticobasal degeneration, and may be due to dysfunction of the supplementary motor area.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} an unusual form of acquired ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> Methods: Case reports with electronic eye movement recordings. Results: Three patients had {{surgery to repair}} aortic root or arch dissections or aneurysms. A few days after surgery, all had ophthalmoplegia. Neuro-ophthalmic examination found complete absence of horizontal and vertical volitional and reflex saccades in 1 patient and slow, hypometric saccades in 2 others. However, smooth pursuit, slow phases of optokinetic nystagmus, and the vestibulo-ocular response (VOR) were intact. Fast phases of the VOR were absent in 2 patients but were intact in the other. Video and electronic eye movement recordings documented the findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 1 patient showed small infarcts in a cerebellar hemisphere, pons, and cerebral hemispheres. The other patients ’ MRIs showed no significant lesions. Conclusions: Acquired ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> with profoundly impaired volitional saccades after aortic surgery is a distinctive syndrome, but its pathophysiology is unclear. Studies of neurologic damage in animals and patients undergoing similar surgical procedures provide conflicting data. However, knowledge about the complex neural pathways generating saccades from animal and human studies, and detailed clinical observations, as in the patients described here, can help to determine the location of lesions.

Damage to these areas {{has been associated}} with two conditions - the speech <b>motor</b> programming disorder <b>apraxia</b> of speech (AOS) and the linguistic / grammatical disorder of Broca’s aphasia. Here we focus on AOS, which is most commonly associated with damage to posterior Broca's area and adjacent cortex. We provide an overview of our own studies into the nature of AOS, including behavioral and neuroimaging methods, to explore components of the speech motor network that are associated with normal and disordered speech motor programming in AOS. Behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling studies are indicating that AOS is associated with impairment in learning feedforward models and/or implementing feedback mechanisms and with the functional contribution of BA 6. While functional connectivity methods are not yet routinely applied to the study of AOS, we highlight the need for focusing on the functional impact of localised lesions throughout the speech network, as well as larger scale comparative studies to distinguish the unique behavioral and neurological signature of AOS. By coupling these methods with neural network models, we have a powerful set of tools to improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie AOS, and speech production generally...|$|R

Assessments took place at baseline, after an 8 week treatment period and 5 months after baseline (follow up). Patients were assessed on <b>apraxia,</b> <b>motor</b> functioning, and activities of daily living (ADL). The primary outcome measure was a standardized ADL-observation by a blinded research assistant. Additional ADL measures were used as secondary outcome measures (Barthel ADL Index, ADL-rating by occupational therapist and by patient). After 8 weeks of treatment, patients who received strategy training (n= 43) improved significantly more than patients in the usual treament group (n= 39) on the ADL-observations (mean change 0. 24; 90 % Cl [0. 15 - 0. 34] vs 0. 12 [0. 03 - 0. 21]). This shows a small to medium effect (effect size 0. 37) of strategy training on ADL-functioning. With respect to the secondary outcome measures, a medium effect (effect size 0. 47) was found on the Barthel ADL Index. No beneficial effects of strategy training were found after 5 months (at follow up).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The nosological {{assignment}} of congenital ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> type Cogan (COMA) is still controversial. While {{regarded as a}} distinct entity by some authorities including the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man catalog of genetic disorders, others consider COMA merely a clinical symptom. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter data collection study with re-evaluation of clinical and neuroimaging data of 21 previously unreported patients (8 female, 13 male, ages ranging from 2 to 24  years) diagnosed as having COMA. RESULTS: Ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> (OMA) was recognized {{during the first year}} of life and confined to horizontal pursuit in all patients. OMA attenuated over the years in most cases, regressed completely in two siblings, and persisted unimproved in one individual. Accompanying clinical features included early onset ataxia in most patients and cognitive impairment with learning disability (n[*]=[*] 6) or intellectual disability (n[*]=[*] 4). Re-evaluation of MRI data sets revealed a hitherto unrecognized molar tooth sign diagnostic for Joubert syndrome in 11 patients, neuroimaging features of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome in one case and cerebral malformation suspicious of a tubulinopathy in another subject. In the remainder, MRI showed vermian hypo-/dysplasia in 4 and no abnormalities in another 4 patients. There was a strong trend to more severe cognitive impairment in patients with Joubert syndrome compared to those with inconclusive MRI, but otherwise no significant difference in clinical phenotypes between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Systematical renewed analysis of neuroimaging data resulted in a diagnostic reappraisal in the majority of patients with early-onset OMA in the cohort reported here. This finding poses a further challenge to the notion of COMA constituting a separate entity and underlines the need for an expert assessment of neuroimaging in children with COMA, especially if they show cognitive impairment...|$|E
40|$|Mirror writing’ – the {{production}} of backwards facing script - occurs frequently in semi-literate children with the dominant right hand, and involuntarily with the non-dominant left hand amongst brain damaged adults, and both involuntarily and intentionally under experimental conditions. Its underlying theoretical mechanisms are disputed; whilst the classic motor hypothesis posits mirror writing to be {{a consequence of the}} non-dominant hand reversing dominant hand canonical writing <b>motor</b> sequences, directional <b>apraxia</b> claims it {{is the product of a}} directionality malfunction, resulting in a reversion to innately preferred outwards movements, regardless of handedness. Although both theories hypothesise more reversals with the left hand amongst dominant right-handers in dextrad (left-to-right) scripts, their predictions for sinistrad (right-to-left) scripts differ. Following anecdotal reports of cognitive load inducing mirror writing (Fuller, 1916;Critchley, 1928), an audio-visual dual task was designed, with naïve English speaking Arabic sinistrad (N= 11) and dextrad (N= 11) bilinguals simultaneously executing the Eriksen Flanker Task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974) and dictated letter transcription on a digitalising touchscreen. Writing on a table under-side - known to yield mirror writing - was briefly studied, with the introduction of the un-investigated manipulation of left hand writing. Participants performed secondary dexterity and directionality tasks, to observe any script culture effects, though most differences between groups were marginal or non-significant. Whilst the dual-task effectively induced mirror writing, script direction had no effect, indicating the superiority of the classic motor hypothesis in experimentally produced mirror writing in healthy adults...|$|R

In the second analysis, selected movement data from the subject’s fluent speech were compared to her dysfluent speech samples to gain more insight into potential underlying speech motor control mechanisms. Overall, the findings indicated that the subject with AOS and Broca’s aphasia was very similar to her age matched controls with respect to fluent speech kinematics. However, in comparing different utterances, specific differences in movement characteristics were identified, especially for upper lip movements and lip coordination. Comparing these results from the fluent speech samples with the changes in gestural motion and coordination for dysfluent speech, the fluent speech characteristics suggest the use of compensatory motor control strategies.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{transfer}} of the effects of cognitive strategy training for stroke patients with apraxia from trained to non-trained tasks. In strategy training, the occurrence of transfer is expected as the training programme is aimed, not at relearning specific tasks, but at teaching patients new ways to handle the problems resulting from the impairment. Exploratory analyses were conducted on data previously collected in a randomised controlled trial on the efficacy of the strategy training. A total of 113 left hemisphere stroke patients were randomly assigned to a strategy training group and a group receiving occupational therapy as usual. Assessment of <b>apraxia,</b> <b>motor</b> functioning and activities of daily living (ADL) took place at baseline, after an eight-week treatment period, and five months after baseline. The primary outcome measure consisted of standardised ADL observations of trained and non-trained tasks. The analyses showed that in both treatment groups, the scores on the ADL observations for non-trained tasks improved significantly after eight weeks of training as compared with the baseline score. Change scores of non-trained activities were larger in the strategy training group as compared with the usual treatment group. By using previously collected data we are able to illustrate the potential transfer of treatment effects in a large sample of stroke patients. We found indications for the occurrence of transfer, although the study was not originally designed for the purpose of evaluating transfer. Therefore these results are worth exploring more profoundly. We will further investigate our preliminary conclusions in a new prospective study which is specifically designed to examine the transfer of training effects. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

The patient’s ocular motor findings were consistent with acquired ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> (OMA), which is characterised by loss of voluntary eye movements with preserved reflex eye movements. 1 In this patient, OMA was due to lesions involving both frontal eye fields, which lie in the caudal middle frontal gyrus and control all voluntary eye movements, including saccades, smooth pursuit and vergence. 1 e 3 The frontal eye fields receive input from the parietal eye field, supplementary eye field and prefrontal cortex. 1 2 The parietal eye field is mainly responsible for reflexive saccades to novel stimuli, 4 which were relatively intact in our patient because this area was spared. Although the frontal and parietal eye fields have specific saccadic functions, the eye fields have complementary roles in saccade generation such that only bilateral lesions to both the frontal and parietal eye fields will cause persistent OMA. 5 Our patient regained some voluntary saccadic initiation several days following presentation, likely due to preservation of the parietal eye fields.

The primary cilium is a subcellular organelle that has key roles in development and in many cellular functions, making Joubert syndrome part of the expanding family of ciliopathies. Notable clinical and genetic overlap exists between distinct ciliopathies, which can co-occur even within families.

However, the core speech disorder subserving CMS is still unclear. Case presentation This study investigates the speech and language symptoms following posterior fossa medulloblastoma surgery in a 12 -year-old right-handed boy. An extensive battery of formal speech (DIAS 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 009 Diagnostic Instrument Apraxia of Speech) and language tests were administered during a follow-up of 6 weeks after surgery. Although the neurological and neuropsychological (affective, cognitive) symptoms of this patient are consistent with Schmahmann 2 ̆ 019 s syndrome, the speech and language symptoms were markedly different from what is typically described in the literature.

40|$|Diagnosis of {{the speech}} <b>motor</b> planning/programming disorder, <b>apraxia</b> of speech (AOS), has proven challenging, largely due to its common co-occurrence with the language-based {{impairment}} of aphasia. Currently, diagnosis is based on perceptually identifying and rating the severity of several speech features.

This population-based case-control study involved a sample of 72 cases, using the outcome measure of expert judgment on presence of AOS and including a large number of independently collected candidate predictors representing behavioral measures of linguistic, cognitive, nonspeech oral motor, and speech motor ability. We constructed a predictive model using multiple imputation to deal with missing data; the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) technique for variable selection to define the most relevant predictors, and bootstrapping to check the model stability and quantify the optimism of the developed model. Two measures were sufficient to distinguish between participants with AOS plus aphasia and those with aphasia alone, (1) a measure of speech errors with words of increasing length and (2) a measure of relative vowel duration in three-syllable words with weak-strong stress pattern (e. g., banana, potato). The model has high discriminative ability to distinguish between cases with and without AOS (c-index= 0. 93) and good agreement between observed and predicted probabilities (calibration slope= 0. 94). Some caution is warranted, given the relatively small sample specific to left-hemisphere stroke, and the limitations of imputing missing data. These two speech measures are straightforward to collect and analyse, facilitating use in research and clinical settings. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Head thrusts {{are well}} {{documented}} in Joubert syndrome and ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> We provide a detailed clinical characterization of head titubation in 13 {{young children with}} Joubert syndrome. Method: Detailed characterization of head titubation was assessed by targeted clinical evaluation and/or analysis of videos. Results: In 12 of 13 children (eight males, five females; median age 6 y, range 2 mo– 15 y) head titubation was first recognized in the first 2 months of age and decreased in severity until spontaneous resolution. In all children, the head titubation was horizontal, high frequency (3 Hz), had small amplitude (5 – 10 °), was never present during sleep, and did {{not interfere with the}} neurodevelopment during infancy. In the majority of children, emotion, anxiety, and tiredness were worsening factors for head titubation. Interpretation: Head titubation is a benign, early presentation of Joubert syndrome. Head titubation in hypotonic infants should prompt a careful search for Joubert syndrome. Awareness of its occurrence in Joubert syndrome may avoid unnecessary investigations...|$|E
40|$|Formalin is a main {{fixative}} in {{the field}} of pathology. Molecular biological analysis of formalin-fixed samples was difficult because formalin fixation decreased the quality of isolated DNA. Therefore, we compared the quality of DNA obtained by using DNA extraction kit (Sepa GeneR) to that using proteinase K. Using proteinase K, it was possible to extract high quality DNA, and obtain DNA from samples of 3 months fixative. Moreover, by proteinase K method, it was also possible to analyze aprataxin gene exon 5 in DNA extraction from formalin-fixed human brain tissues from a suspected case of early-onset ataxia with ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH). The aprataxin gene exon 5 DNA sequences were obtained following in vitro gene amplification using nested-PCR. Mutation on aprataxin gene exon 5 was not observed in the suspected case of EAOH; however, it was possible to perform sequence analysis of aprataxin gene exon 5. This method was more useful for DNA extraction and direct sequencing of formalin-fixation samples than the kit method...|$|E
40|$|Cerebellar {{dysplasia}} with cysts and abnormal {{shape of}} the fourth ventricle, {{in the absence of}} significant supratentorial anomalies and of muscular involvement, defines recessively inherited Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome (PBS). Clinical features comprise non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability of variable degree, language impairment, ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> and frequent occurrence of myopia or retinopathy. Recently, loss-of-function variants in the LAMA 1 gene were identified in six probands with PBS. Here we report the detailed clinical, neuroimaging and genetic characterization of 18 PBS patients from 15 unrelated families. Biallelic LAMA 1 variants were identified in 14 families (93 %). The only non-mutated proband presented atypical clinical and neuroimaging features, challenging the diagnosis of PBS. Sixteen distinct variants were identified, which were all novel. In particular, the frameshift variant c. [2935 delA] recurred in six unrelated families on a shared haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. No LAMA 1 variants could be detected in 27 probands with different cerebellar dysplasias or non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, confirming the strong correlate between LAMA 1 variants and PBS...|$|E
40|$|Feedback is {{considered}} one of the most important variables in motor learning. The method of its application, however, can determine whether it exerts positive or negative influences on different aspects of motor control and learning. Thus, a principled approach must govern its use, particularly in the treatment of motor impairments. This dissertation examined the effects of theory-driven feedback manipulations on treatment of the speech <b>motor</b> programming disorder <b>apraxia</b> of speech (AOS). Motor learning research shows that delaying or reducing the frequency of feedback promotes retention and transfer of skills. In contrast, immediate or frequent feedback may temporarily enhance performance during acquisition, yet interfere with learning. The first two experiments in this dissertation tested these predictions in the context of a common treatment for AOS. The results provided evidence that reducing or delaying feedback provision promotes learning in some individuals with AOS, but also raised questions about how to determine which feedback manipulations provide optimal learning conditions for particular individuals. The general motor learning literature has shown that allowing learners to control their own feedback schedules facilitates learning, suggesting that it enables learners to receive feedback when they need it. Experiments 3 and 4 extended these notions to speech motor programming and learning in healthy speakers and those with AOS. Results from healthy speakers indicated that learner-controlled feedback manipulations affected different stages and aspects of motor programming (i. e., the translation of language units to speech motor commands), and that the benefits of learner-controlled feedback may be related to promotion of self-evaluation skills. Results from speakers with AOS provided qualified support for the application of learner- controlled feedback to the treatment of this disorder and provide impetus for further investigation. Overall, this research has demonstrated that individuals with AOS benefit from structured intervention, and that it is important to consider the influence of feedback variables when implementing AOS treatment. It has also demonstrated that the speech motor control system may share properties in common with general motor control, and that by extending general motor principles to the speech domain, we may increase our understanding of normal and disordered speech motor control and learnin...|$|R
40|$|Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive spinocerebellar ataxia which {{in the majority of}} cases is associated with a GAA-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of Frataxin gene located on chromosome 9. The clinical features include progressive gait and limb ataxia, cerebellar dysarthria, neuropathy, optic atrophy, and loss of vibration and proprioception. Ataxia with ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> type 1 (AOA 1) is another {{autosomal recessive}} cerebellar ataxia which is associated with oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Here we describe two siblings (13 - and 10 -year-old) display overlapping clinical features of both early-onset FRDA and AOA 1. Almost all of laboratory test (including urinary analysis/culture, biochemistry, peripheral blood smear, C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate- 1 h) results were within the normal range for both patients. Due to the normal laboratory test results; we concluded that the diagnosis was more likely to be FRDA than AOA 1. Therefore, neurologists should bear in mind that clinical presentations of FRDA may vary widely from the classical phenotype of gait and limb ataxia to atypical manifestations such as oculomotor apraxia...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: We report {{prenatal}} and neonatal neuroimaging {{findings in}} a case of oral-facial-digital syndrome type VI (OFDS VI). Prenatal MR imaging at 29 weeks ’ gestation showed hypoplastic cerebellar vermis and hemispheres, the molar tooth sign, and a hypothalamic hamartoma. Neonatal MR imaging confirmed these findings. The neonate developed breathing abnormalities and exhibited frontal bossing, multiple bucco-alveolar frenula, and postaxial hexadactyly of both hands. If the molar tooth sign and a hypothalamic hamartoma are present, prenatal diagnosis of OFDS VI is possible. Oral-facial-digital syndrome type VI (OFDS VI) or Váradi-Papp syndrome (OMIM 277170) is a rare autosomal reces-sive syndrome 1, 2 belonging to Joubert syndrome and related dis-orders (JSRD), 3 whereof less than 40 cases have been reported. The genetic basis remains unknown. JSRD and OFDS VI can presentwith similarneurologic symptoms suchashypotonia, de-layed milestones, ataxia, cognitive impairment, irregular breath-ing in the neonatal period, and ocular <b>motor</b> <b>apraxia</b> 4 as well as facial dysmorphic signs. 5 However, postaxial polydactyly is a typ-ical finding in OFDS VI but is only rarely observed in JSRD. ...|$|E
