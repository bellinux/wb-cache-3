40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Changes in the {{pollinator}} {{communities of}} <b>marginal</b> plant <b>populations</b> can affect their pollination quantity or quality. Geographic variation in pollination success {{can alter the}} reproductive advantage that female plants require to persist within gynodioecious populations. Particularly valuable is determining the pollination success at the prezygotic stage in self-compatible gynodioecious species whose females do not exhibit enhanced seed production. METHODS: In core and <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> of Daphne laureola, we analyzed the differences between hermaphrodites and females {{in the proportion of}} flowers visited, the stigma pollen loads, and the quantity of pollen tubes in styles. We also examined the relationship between the number of pollen tubes in styles vs. the number of pollen grains on stigmas using piecewise regression and binomial generalized linear mixed models. KEY RESULTS: Pollinators deposited larger pollen loads on flowers in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations.</b> In <b>marginal</b> <b>populations,</b> female flowers received more pollinator visits and more pollen grains on their stigmas, and they had more pollen tubes in their styles than did female flowers in core populations. Both piecewise regression and binomial GLMM analyses showed that females in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> had a lower proportion of grains that developed tubes than females in the core populations, which suggests decreased pollination quality. CONCLUSIONS: More efficient pollination services in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> decreased the overall differences in the prezygotic pollination success between the sex morphs. Our results also suggest that pollination quality is lower in females of <b>marginal</b> <b>populations,</b> which could be counteracting the increased pollination in females in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Marginal</b> <b>populations</b> are {{expected}} to provide the frontiers for adaptation, evolution and range shifts of plant species under the anticipated climate change conditions. <b>Marginal</b> <b>populations</b> are predicted to show genetic divergence from central populations due to their isolation, and divergent natural selection and genetic drift operating therein. <b>Marginal</b> <b>populations</b> are also expected to have lower genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne) and higher genetic differentiation than central populations. We tested these hypotheses using eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) {{as a model for}} keystone, long-lived widely-distributed plants. All 614 eastern white pine trees, in a complete census of two <b>populations</b> each of <b>marginal</b> old-growth, central old-growth, and central second-growth, were genotyped at 11 microsatellite loci. The central populations had significantly higher allelic and genotypic diversity, latent genetic potential (LGP) and Ne than the <b>marginal</b> <b>populations.</b> However, heterozygosity and fixation index were similar between them. The <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> were genetically diverged from the central populations. Model testing suggested predominant north to south gene flow in the study area with curtailed gene flow to northern <b>marginal</b> <b>populations.</b> Signatures of natural selection were detected at three loci in the marginal populations; two showing divergent selection with directional change in allele frequencies, and one balancing selection. Contrary to the general belief, no significant differences were observed in genetic diversity, differentiation, LGP, and Ne between old-growth and second-growth populations.

40|$|Many species {{expanded}} their geographic ranges from core "refugium" populations when the global climate warmed after the Pleistocene. The bottlenecks that occur during such range expansions diminish genetic variation in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations,</b> rendering them less responsive to selection.

We compared inbreeding depression among 20 populations across the expanded range of a common European plant, and found that <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> had greatly reduced inbreeding depression.

Low inbreeding depression is predicted to ease conditions {{for the evolution of}} self-fertilization, and selfing is known to be particularly frequent in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations.</b> Therefore, our findings expose a remarkable aspect of evolution at range margins, where a history of expansion can reverse the direction of selection on the mating system, providing a parsimonious explanation for the high incidence of selfing in <b>marginal</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R

The Confederates had hoped that they could trap the Federals at the river, but they had already crossed before any plan could materialize. The 1890 Census puts the population of Hallsville at a mere 24 persons. In 1899, however, Hallsville became the upper-most loading point for the steamship Saint Peter, which made runs to the port of Wilmington. [...] The primary export of Hallsville during this period was lumber and naval stores. The community, now being serviced by a steamship, saw a sudden, although <b>marginal,</b> <b>population</b> increase. The upper stretch of the [...] "Northeast River", however, could be quite treacherous and was not conducive to frequent travel by steamship. When the Kinston Carolina Railroad Company laid track through the eastern portion of Duplin County in 1916, Hallsville was bypassed. With the incorporation of nearby Beulaville at the advantageous intersection of several major thoroughfares the following year, the importance of Hallsville was negated and the remainder of the community's population began dispersing, save but a few families.|$|E

Here we investigate the metabolic and reproductive plasticity in response to water temperature and salinity variation of two populations of the eurythermic saline water bug Sigara selecta: one population located close to the northern edge of its distribution, in a relatively cold, thermally stable region (SE England – ‘marginal’), and one close to the range centre, in a warmer and more thermally variable Mediterranean climate (SE Spain – ‘core’). We compared metabolic and oviposition rates and egg size, following exposure to one of four different combinations of temperature (15 and 25 °C) and salinity (10 and 35 g L¯¹). Oviposition rate was significantly higher in the <b>marginal</b> <b>population,</b> although eggs laid were smaller overall. No significant differences in oxygen consumption rates were found between core and marginal populations, although the <b>marginal</b> <b>population</b> showed higher levels of plasticity in both metabolic and reproductive traits. Our results suggest that population-specific responses to environmental change are complex and may be mediated by differences in phenotypic plasticity. In S. selecta, the higher plasticity of the <b>marginal</b> <b>population</b> may facilitate both its persistence in current habitats and northward expansion with future climatic warming. The less plastic core population may be able to buffer current environmental variability with minor changes in metabolism and fecundity, but could be prone to extinction if temperature and salinity changes exceed physiological tolerance limits in the future...|$|E

The spatial distribution of the tree in the administrative Region (Abruzzo) was used to define the ecological traits while three modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, Random Forest) were used to build a Species distribution model according to two climatic scenarios. Main results: The marginal population's range was predicted to shift at higher elevations as consequence of climatic adaptation. Many zones, represented by the higher part of the mountains surrounding the study area (currently bare and inhospitable for trees), were identified as suitable in future for the species. However, {{in the case of a}} rapid climate change, this <b>marginal</b> <b>population</b> may not be able to move as fast as necessary. An in-situ adaptive management integrated with an assisted migration protocol might be considered to enforce the natural regeneration and improve the richness and variability of the genetic pool. Research highlights: Most of the genetic richness is held in small populations at the borders of natural distribution of forest species. Monitoring this MAP could be useful to understand the adaptive processes of the species and could support the future management of many other within-core populations.

In this study, we analysed the level of neutral genetic differentiation among populations of the long-lived shrub Daphne laureola (Thymelaeaceae) across the Baetic Ranges, a glacial refugium and biodiversity hotspot in the western Mediterranean Basin. Within this area, core and <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> of D. laureola were compared {{with regard to their}} spatial isolation, size, genetic diversity and differentiation. A spatially explicit analysis conducted on {{the vast majority of the}} species' known populations in the study area (N= 111) showed that <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> (western and eastern) present larger spatial isolation than core populations, but are not smaller. We compared genetic diversity and differentiation between core and <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> using a subsample of 15 populations and 225 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Core and <b>marginal</b> <b>populations</b> did not differ in genetic diversity, probably because of the occurrence of large populations on the local margins.
