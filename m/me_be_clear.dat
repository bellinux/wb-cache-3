60|$|Dearest Mr. Boyd,--Let <b>me</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> of your reproaches for {{not going}} to you this week. The truth is that I have been so much shocked and shaken by the dreadful suicide of poor Mr. Haydon, the artist, I had not spirits for it. He was not {{personally}} my friend. I never saw him face to face. But we had corresponded, {{and one of his}} last acts was an act of trust towards me. Also I admired his genius. And all to end so! It has naturally affected me much.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR BRIGHT,—(Let us bid {{farewell}} to Misters.) ... As to the [...] parliamentary future {{of the question of}} education, we had better [...] talk when we meet. I remember your saying well and wisely how we [...] should look to the average opinion of the party. What we want at [...] present is a positive force to carry us onward as a body. I do [...] not see that this can be got out of local taxation, or out of the [...] suffrage (whether we act in that matter or not, and individually [...] I am more yes than no), or out of education. It may possibly, I [...] think, be had out of finance. Of course I cannot as yet see my [...] way on that subject; but until it is cleared, nothing else will to [...] <b>me</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear.</b> If it can be worked into certain shapes, it may [...] greatly help to mould the rest, at least for the time. I think the [...] effect of the reconstruction may be described as follows: First, [...] we have you. Secondly, we have emerged from the discredit and [...] disgrace of the exposures by an administration of mild penal [...] justice, which will be complete all round when Monsell has been [...] disposed of. Thirdly, we have now before us a clean stage for the [...] consideration of measures in the autumn. We must, I think, have a [...] good bill of fare, or none. If we differ on the things to be done, [...] this may end us in a way at least not dishonourable. If we agree [...] on a good plan, it must come to good, whether we succeed or fail [...] with it. Such are my crude reflections, and such my outlook for [...] the future. Let me again say how sensible I am of the kindness, [...] friendship, and public spirit with which you have acted in the [...] whole of this matter.|$|E

6000|$|The Vision of Sir Launfal and the Fable for Critics, {{published}} in the same year, illustrate the two dominant and strikingly contrasted qualities of his nature, a contrast of opposites which he himself clearly perceived.

It was the Saint Francis of New England, the moral and spiritual enthusiast in Lowell's nature that produced the poem and gave it power. Thus we see that notwithstanding its antique style and artificial structure, it was a perfectly direct and spontaneous expression of himself.|$|R
