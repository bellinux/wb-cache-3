5|$|On 7 June 1917, II ANZAC Corps—along {{with two}} British corps—launched an {{operation}} in Flanders {{in order to}} eliminate a salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds (454,545kg) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of Messines included nearly 6,800 <b>men.</b> <b>I</b> ANZAC Corps then {{took part in the}} Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau, between September and November 1917. Individual actions took place at Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks of fighting the Australians suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
