Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent, comedy tent and circus. To the south are the green fields, which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King's Meadow, the hill at the far south of the site, is a modern small <b>megalith</b> circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated with the summer solstice, and since 1990 represents a stone circle.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{stone or}} <b>megalith,</b> {{referred to as}} the Lochmabonstone by Logan Mack in 1926, has, in the Borders context, an unsurpassed extent of history attached to it. It is an erratic, 7 feet high and 18 feet in girth and weighs approximately ten tons. It is composed of weathered granite, exposed to severe glacial action.|$|E
25|$|The {{monument}} of Msoura is {{the best-known}} megalithic monument in northwest Africa. It {{is composed of}} a circle of megaliths surrounding a tumulus. The highest <b>megalith</b> is longer than 5 meters. According to legend, it is the sepulchre of the mythical Berber king Antaeus. Another megalithic monument was discovered in 1926 to south of Casablanca. The monument was engraved with funerary inscriptions in the Berber script known as Tifinagh.|$|E

French: Les <b>Megaliths</b> du Haut Laos) is a 1930 work of {{archaeology}} by Madeleine Colani, examining and cataloging approximately ten thousand <b>megaliths</b> in Upper Laos. [...] Prior to Colani's work, the <b>megaliths</b> were {{considered among the}} more mysterious <b>megaliths.</b> [...] Colani, after reviewing the Plain of Jars for decades, cataloged the <b>megaliths</b> and argued [...] "convincingly" [...] in The <b>Megaliths</b> of Upper Laos that they were urns, used in Bronze Age funerary rites.|$|R
50|$|The Gornaya Shoria <b>megaliths</b> (Mount Shoria <b>megaliths)</b> are rock {{formations}} {{that are part}} of Gornaya Shoria (Горная Шория) in southern Siberia, Russia, lying to the east of the Altay Mountains. Popular, often fringe, articles have claimed these {{rock formations}} to be gigantic prehistoric man-made blocks, or <b>megaliths.</b> It is reported that the largest pieces or blocks of stone have estimated weights between three and four thousand tons, which would make them larger than the <b>megaliths</b> at Baalbek, in Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 400 granite <b>megaliths</b> in the area, of which about 30 {{represent}} human forms. They vary {{in size from}} a few centimetres to ca.4.5 m. The original purpose of the <b>megaliths</b> is unknown. Other <b>megaliths</b> {{in the area are}} large stone pots (Kalamba) accompanied by stone lids (Tutu'na). The <b>megaliths</b> are spread over the Napu, Behoa (Pokekea Megalithic Site) and Bada valleys. Various archaeological studies have dated the carvings from between 3000 BC to 1300 AD.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the late}} Neolithic stone balls have diameters differing by only a millimetre. The {{discovery}} of {{this led to the}} suggestion that they might have been meant to be used together. By plotting the find sites on a map it can be demonstrated that often these petrospheres were located in the vicinity of Neolithic recumbent stone circles. Models using small wooden balls placed in a groove in parallel longitudinal pieces of wood 'sleepers' with a carrying board above have shown such <b>megalith</b> transport to be practical in some situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} architectural activity in Portugal {{date from the}} Neolithic and consist of structures associated with <b>Megalith</b> culture. The Portuguese hinterland is dotted {{with a large number}} of dolmens (called antas or dólmens), tumuli (mamoas) and menhirs. The Alentejo region is particularly rich in megalithic monuments, like the notable Anta Grande do Zambujeiro, located near Évora. Standing stones can be found isolated or forming circular arrays (stone circles or cromlechs). The Almendres Cromlech, also located near Évora, is the largest of the Iberian Peninsula, containing nearly 100 menhirs arranged in two elliptical arrays on an East-West orientation.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the process of {{quarrying}} the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles. One exception is at Vestra Fiold in Orkney, where Colin Richards led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface. These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the <b>megalith</b> to be moved. One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Megaliths</b> in South Asia is dated before 3000 BC, {{with recent}} {{findings}} dated back to 5000 BC in southern India. <b>Megaliths</b> {{are found in}} almost {{all parts of the}} South Asia and there is also a broad timeevolution with the <b>megaliths</b> in central India and upper Indus valley where oldest <b>Megaliths</b> are also found, whilethose in the east are of much later date. A large fraction of these are assumed to be associated with burial or post burial rituals including memorials for those whose remains {{may or may not be}} available. The case-example is that of Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1975) and helped establish the culturesequence in south Indian prehistory. However, there is another distinct class of <b>megaliths</b> that do not seem to be associated with burials.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not known}} what {{language}} these early Scandinavians spoke. It might have been similar to Basque, due to {{the distribution of the}} monuments by early <b>megalith</b> builders. Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, they were overrun by new groups who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European, the Battle-Axe culture. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. This new culture was individualistic and patriarchal with the battle axe as a status symbol, and were cattle herders. However, soon a new invention would arrive, that would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|Aughanduff was {{probably}} first {{settled in the}} Bronze Age. No prehistoric remains of note appear {{to survive in the}} area, however, bar an undated site listed on the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's Monuments and Buildings Record. This is thought to have been an enclosure 60m in diameter, set on a localised height within the townland at Irish Grid Reference H9736023370. Photographic records show a series of earthworks and although a field inspection in 2004 failed to locate upstanding remains, it is noted that the site would have been an excellent position for a settlement. The townland lies just over a mile (2km) from An Aughnaclough mullion, where in 1815 the first, and reportedly most remarkable, <b>megalith</b> tomb in Ireland (subsequently destroyed) was discovered by Mr. John Bell of Newry. Several prehistoric stone structures have been found and documented in the area but many have been lost over the years. An example of such a structure was a ring fort named 'the Lis' which appears on the map of 1827 as being in the field adjacent to where the Church now stands, however this structure is no longer visible and must be presumed to have been destroyed.|$|E
500|$|For example, in June 1979, {{an unknown}} benefactor under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "R. C. Christian" [...] {{had a huge}} granite <b>megalith</b> built in the U.S. state of Georgia, which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed. The [...] "Georgia Guidestones" [...] have subsequently become a spiritual and political Rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and neo-pagans revere it as a ley-line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian [...] "Ten Commandments." [...] Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer’s original intention.|$|E
25|$|The {{sites of}} Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa {{were added to}} the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000.

30|$|Let {{us first}} discuss why the authors claim Claim 2.1. Take Valley Temple, Egypt (BC 2500 ?) and Parthenon, Athens (BC 447 - 432), for example, {{which are made}} of <b>megaliths.</b> At that period around those areas, {{there were plenty of}} <b>megaliths</b> available, {{therefore}} they made Valley Temple and Parthenon of <b>megaliths</b> which are very suitable for edifices. On the other hand, let us turn to Colosseum, Rome (AD 70 - 80). Its bailey or external wall being made of <b>megaliths,</b> its interior structure is infilled with stones, bricks, sand and Roman cement as bonding material (ash, for example), which we take for the origin of the concrete. It may be because of the shortage of the <b>megaliths</b> in Rome about 2000 years ago. Note that the structure of Colosseum still exists more than 2000 years after its foundation. Hence we claim that the primitive concrete materials applied to the interior infill wall of Colosseum have been playing their important role as the substitutes for the <b>megaliths</b> very well for milleniums, {{which is one of the}} reasons why the authors claim Claim 2.1.|$|R
500|$|There {{are also}} {{large numbers of}} {{chambered}} tombs and cairns from this period. Many different types have been identified, {{but they can be}} roughly grouped into passage graves, gallery graves and stone cists. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab. Maes Howe, near Stenness on the mainland of Orkney (dated 3400–3200 BCE) and Monamore, Isle of Arran (dated approximately 3500 BCE) are passage graves, of <b>megalith</b> construction, built with large stones, many of which weigh several tons. Gallery graves are rectangular gallery-like spaces, where the entrance at one end is the width of the gallery. These were sometimes lined or roofed with slabs and then covered with earth. Among the most impressive surviving monuments of the period are the first sets of standing stones in Scotland, such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE, of four stones, the tallest of which is [...] in height.|$|E
500|$|The {{rich history}} of Strandzha has left {{important}} vestiges across {{the territory of}} the park. The Thracians worshipped a Sun god as early as the Bronze Age and many of their rock sanctuaries and dolmens have been preserved in Strandzha. One of the main characteristics is the presence of <b>megalith</b> structures. Among the most important monuments of that epoch is the Thracian cult complex in Mishkova Niva, one the south-eastern slopes of Golyamo Gradishte peak [...] from Malko Tarnovo. The complex, constructed in honour of a local chief and high priest, included a domed mound, a fortified edifice for the priests, a mould necropolis, a mine and a fortress. The domed mound has a diameter of , built by three rows and white marble blocks, and has been preserved up to a height of [...] The fortress is situated on Golyamo Gradishte peak, the highest point of the park; its diameter is 10 and the walls are [...] thick. In the 5th–3rd century BC it was a dolmen and it was reconstructed as a monumental sanctuary in the 3rd–2nd century BC. The complex had a prominent place in the religious life of the Thracian tribes from all over the mountain.|$|E
500|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. Britain was largely forested in this period, with Kent only seeing widespread forest clearance in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone — a <b>megalith</b> in the vicinity of Chestnuts Long Barrow — supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life.|$|E

2500|$|Fragments {{of stone}} {{used in the}} {{construction}} of the monument underwent a petrological examination at the British Museum in London, where it was established that they were a form of oolithic limestone that was local to the area around the Rollrights. Archaeologist George Lambrick argued that the stones had been discovered by prehistoric peoples as naturally occurring surface boulders, rather than having been quarried, because of certain weathering patterns that could be found on them and which were consistent with those found on surface boulders. He went on to argue that the most likely place that such surface boulders would have been found in the late prehistoric was [...] "on the sides of the ridge at or near the level of the strong spring line between the Inferior Oolithic and the Lias clay." [...] If this had indeed been the place where the <b>megalith</b> builders had found the boulders, then they would have had to be transported up hill, at a gradient averaging about 1 in 15 on the shortest routes, for either 250 metres (for the Whispering Knights), or 450 metres (for the King Stone and King's Men).|$|E
