5|$|During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh had <b>maintained</b> <b>an</b> {{embryonic}} bureaucracy in {{an attempt}} to prove his leadership ability to the people.

5|$|In 1797, he {{was elected}} as member of Parliament for Leominster, a {{position}} that gave him immunity from his creditors. When that parliament dissolved in 1802, he fled to France.

5|$|In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and {{appointed}} Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead.

The irregular elevation of Photios, however, riled with Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.|$|E
