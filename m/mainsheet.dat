500|$|That same day, Jackalow, {{anchored}} on {{a nearby}} yawl boat and was taken aboard the schooner Thomas F. French (of Suffolk, Virginia), captained by James Webb, who believed Jackalow to be a kanaka. (Other accounts call him a lascar.) Jackalow gave contradictory accounts of {{the fate of the}} Leetes. He told Webb that Jonathan was sick in the cabin and that Elijah had been knocked overboard by the boom, but he subsequently changed his story, claiming that one brother had fallen overboard from the bowsprit, and the other had been knocked overboard by the <b>mainsheet.</b> [...] Webb sailed to Little Egg Harbor, finding the Lucinda and its captain and hearing Willis's account of the collision. Webb made no attempt to detain Jackalow, who accompanied him ashore in a small row boat before immediately disappearing into a crowd.|$|E
2500|$|As these boats have an aft cockpit layout, {{for ease}} of {{handling}} all halyards and controls are led through rope clutches {{to a pair of}} two-speed winches at the aft corners of the cabin top. [...] The primary and secondary winches are positioned at the margins of the wide cockpit. <b>Mainsheet</b> control is through a <b>mainsheet</b> traveller with roller bearing car and crosshaul tackle recessed into the bridgedeck. [...] Two inboard genoa tracks with low lead genoa cars rolling on ball-bearing travelers to permit adjustment while under-way and there are additional inboard leads for the light Genoa inset at the aft corners of the cabin.|$|E
60|$|Lashing {{the wheel}} I ran forward, eased the fore and <b>mainsheets,</b> took {{in on the}} boom-tackles and trimmed {{everything}} for the quartering breeze which was ours. It was a fresh breeze, very fresh, but I resolved to run as long as I dared. Unfortunately, when running free, {{it is impossible to}} lash the wheel, so I faced an all-night watch. Maud insisted on relieving me, but proved that she had not the strength to steer in a heavy sea, even if she could have gained the wisdom on such short notice. She appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery, but recovered her spirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes. Then there were meals to be cooked in the galley, beds to make, Wolf Larsen to be attended upon, and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning attack upon the cabin and steerage.|$|R
60|$|The Ghost {{swung around}} into the wind, and I {{finished}} my work forward {{in time to}} run aft and lend a hand with the <b>mainsheet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Harry {{glanced over}} his shoulder. [...] "Sure," [...] he nodded. [...] "What's more, she's coming right along our track. Get in some <b>mainsheet</b> while I luff her." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry, still {{intent on}} Meringe, took {{advantage}} of the level footing to recover himself and scramble toward the rail. But he was deflected by the crash of the <b>mainsheet</b> blocks on the stout deck-traveller, as the mainsail, emptied of the wind and feeling the wind on the other side, swung crazily across above him. He cleared the danger of the <b>mainsheet</b> with a wild leap (although no less wild had been Van Horn's leap to rescue him), and found himself directly under the mainboom with the huge sail looming above him as if about to fall upon him and crush him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ready about," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Give me the wheel, White Man, and you {{stand by the}} <b>mainsheet.</b> Boom tackle, Mr. Hay, please, {{and then you can}} jump forward and attend head sails." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank let the <b>mainsheet</b> run and {{afterward}} leaned breathlessly upon the coaming with a thrill of relief {{as they drove}} out into the deeper water; but it appeared that his companion was not satisfied yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got to do}} it somehow," [...] he said. [...] "Stand by your lee {{jibsheet}} {{and tail}} on to the <b>mainsheet</b> the moment you let it run. Hold on till I tell you. We'll wait for a smooth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Mr. Van Weyden!” he cried, and I heard {{through the}} tumult {{as one might}} hear a whisper. “Stand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty! The rest of you tail aft to the <b>mainsheet!</b> Lively now! or I’ll sail you all into Kingdom Come! Understand?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand by main halyards!--Jump!" [...] {{he could}} hear Skipper {{shouting}} loudly; also he heard the high note of the <b>mainsheet</b> screaming across the sheaves as Van Horn, bending braces in the dark, was swiftly slacking the sheet through his scorching palms with a single turn on the cleat.|$|E
6000|$|The squall ceased as {{abruptly}} {{as it had}} struck. The Arangi righted with a jerk to an even keel, leaving Jerry {{stranded in}} the starboard scuppers. He trotted across the level deck to Skipper, who, standing erect on wide-spread legs, the bight of the <b>mainsheet</b> still in his hand, was exclaiming: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} helm with a bound, {{and all three}} {{struggled}} desperately with a rope, while as the bagged mainsail extended and straightened out a sea broke on board the boat. Then they floundered aft and dragged in the <b>mainsheet</b> with all their might, after which Mr. Oliver jumped for the helm again, while the boys flattened in the jib.|$|E
60|$|Frank obeyed him {{and when}} they hauled on the <b>mainsheet</b> the sloop once more {{gathered}} speed, while Frank glancing astern saw a strip of slanted sail appear {{around the corner of}} the head. Then he glanced ashore, and though he saw no sign of Mr. Oliver the slope to the beach was not remarkably steep and he fancied that the rancher would not have much trouble in ascending it.|$|E
60|$|It wasn't real. It was a dream. That canoe {{slid over}} the water like a streak of silver. I climbed out on the {{outrigger}} and supplied the weight to hold her down, while Tehei (pronounced Tayhayee) supplied the nerve. He, too, in the puffs, climbed part way out on the outrigger, {{at the same time}} steering with both hands on a large paddle and holding the <b>mainsheet</b> with his foot.|$|E
60|$|They let her drift {{while they}} looked gloomily to windward, where the island lay. It {{would need a}} stern effort to reach it unless the wind should change; {{a long stretch of}} foaming sea which the sloop must be driven across {{close-hauled}} divided the men from the wreck. They were all worn out and depressed; and neither of Moran’s comrades protested when he got up abruptly and slacked off the <b>mainsheet.</b>|$|E
60|$|The breeze {{came down}} fresher {{as they drove}} out through the Narrows. Carroll had gone below; and, {{brushing}} his thoughts aside, Vane busied himself hauling {{in some of the}} <b>mainsheet,</b> while the water splashed more loudly beneath the bows. The great black firs rolled by in somber masses over his port hand, and presently the last of the lights were blotted out. He was alone, flitting swiftly and smoothly across the glittering sea.|$|E
60|$|Frank helped drag {{some more}} <b>mainsheet</b> {{and then looked}} around again with a very {{unpleasant}} thrill of apprehension. The black bow seemed almost above them, and the sea leaped against a wall of plates as the great mass of iron swung slowly {{out of it and}} sank down again. Then from somewhere beside the smokestack a streak of white steam blew out and a great reverberatory roar came hurtling about them. Mr. Oliver's anxious face relaxed.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Moran {{recognized}} the urgent tone, for they {{felt by the}} change of motion that he was altering the boat’s course, but with characteristic coolness he neglected no seamanlike precaution. Jimmy heard the jib being hauled aback and the <b>mainsheet</b> got in, and she was hove to, rising and falling with an easy lurch, when Moran dropped through the scuttle. He stooped over the box, and after a time looked up with a heavy frown.|$|E
60|$|When {{the white}} turmoil on the reef was close ahead {{she saw a}} break in the rocks. The gap was dark and very narrow; {{spouting}} foam played about its mouth. Wyndham signed to the fisher lad at the <b>mainsheet,</b> blocks rattled, and Red Rose, swerving, listed over until her lee deck was in the foam. Showers of spray blew across her, she was sailing very fast, and Flora knew she would soon be broken on the rocks if Wyndham missed the harbor mouth.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Oliver put {{the helm}} {{up as the}} bows swung around, and when the sloop slanted over Jake made a futile grab at the dog. Then {{shouting}} to Frank, he dropped into the canoe and clutched the rail as the sloop forged ahead, but the boy was busy with the <b>mainsheet</b> and did not look up. In another moment Jake let go. Almost immediately afterward the sloop came round, and when she stretched away toward {{the mouth of the}} cove the canoe dropped astern.|$|E
60|$|The trade, {{which had}} laid the Arangi well {{up under the}} lee of this outjutting point of Malaita, was now failing, so that she began to roll in the easy swells with crashings of sheets and tackles and thunderous flappings of her sails. Jerry no more than cocked a contemptuous quizzical eye at the {{mainsail}} anticking above him. He knew already the empty windiness of its threats, but he was careful of the <b>mainsheet</b> blocks, and walked around the traveller instead of over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} I saved your life?" [...] {{returned}} the other, not deigning {{to look at}} him, his eyes travelling instead between the compass and the sails. [...] "Where would you have been if that boom had swung out and you bundled in the slack? No, sir, we'll have no more of you at the <b>mainsheet.</b> Seaport towns are full of mainsheet-men; they hop upon one leg, my son, what's left of them, and the rest are dead. (Set your boom tackle, Mr. Hay.) Struck you, did I? Lucky for you I did." ...|$|E
60|$|The Arangi {{was beating}} {{out between the}} coral patches of the narrow channel into {{the teeth of the}} brisk trade wind. This necessitated {{frequent}} tacks, so that, overhead, the mainsail was ever swooping across from port tack to starboard tack and back again, making air-noises like the swish of wings, sharply rat-tat-tatting its reef points and loudly crashing its <b>mainsheet</b> gear along the traveller. Half a dozen times, as it swooped overhead, Jerry leaped for it, mouth open to grip, lips writhed clear of the clean puppy teeth that shone in the sun like gems of ivory.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two they hung on, not daring to move and waiting until they {{gathered}} strength. Then they carefully worked their way to the inner end of the spar and dropped, exhausted, on the deck. There was however, no rest for them. The massive boom must be dragged back and dropped into its crutch. It could not be left to lurch about and smash all it struck. Marston was vaguely conscious that a gang of Krooboys ran to the <b>mainsheet</b> and Wyndham directed their efforts. He, himself, could do no more, and he leaned against the rail, breathing hard.|$|E
6000|$|Fortunately my {{companion}} was quick-witted and cool, and, {{standing at the}} helm, followed my instructions promptly, while I dragged at the halliards, and the loose folds of sailcloth rose thrashing overhead. I was breathless when the sail was set, but sprang aft to the helm, lifted the girl to the weather deck, and perched myself as high on that side as I could, with the <b>mainsheet</b> round my left wrist and my right hand on the tiller, wondering if the mast would bear the strain. The boat swayed down until her leeward deck was buried in a rush of foam and her bending mast slanted half way to the horizontal. Little clouds of spray shot up from her weather bow as, gathering way, she swept ahead, and then they gave place to sheets of water, which lashed our faces, and, sluicing deep along the decks, poured over the coaming ledge into the open well. Still, we were in comparatively smooth water where one could risk a little, and while the straining <b>mainsheet,</b> which I dare not make fast, sawed into my wrist, I glanced at {{my companion}}. Her hat was sodden--already her hair clung in soaked clusters to her forehead, and her wet face showed white against the dark water which raced past us. Yet it was still confident, and her voice was level as she said: [...] "Let me help you. That rope is cutting your wrist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Nigel," [...] {{said the}} hermit, [...] "unship the mast, reeve the halyard of this {{foresail}} {{through the top}} and then re-ship it. Moses {{will give you the}} mainsail when ready, and you can hook the halyards on to it. The thing is too simple to require explanation to a sailor. I attend to the foresail and Moses manages the <b>mainsheet,</b> but you have to mind the halyards of both, which, as you would see if it were light enough, run down alongside the mast. All I ask you to remember is to be smart in obeying orders, for squalls are sometimes very sudden here--but I doubt not that such a caution is needless." ...|$|E
60|$|This, as Wyllard recognised, was necessary, {{though he}} would sooner have had {{somebody}} by him, {{and the rest of}} them ready to let the <b>mainsheet</b> run, for he was a little to windward of the opening, and surmised that he would have to run the schooner down upon the boat. It was a few moments later when he saw her emerge from among the ice, and the men in her appeared to be pulling strenuously. They were, perhaps, half a mile off, and the schooner was sailing very fast and heading for the ice. Then he lost sight of her again, for a thin shower of whirling snow suddenly obscured the light. Dampier called to him.|$|E
60|$|He fancied {{he cried}} out in warning, but was never sure of it, though three men came running to seize the <b>mainsheet.</b> The {{schooner}} fell off a little, swinging until the boom-foresail came over with a thunderous bang and crash. She rolled down, heaving a wide strip of wet planking out of the sea, and now {{for a moment or}} two there were great breadths of canvas swung out on either hand. Then the ponderous main-boom went up high above his head, and he saw three shadowy figures dragged aft as they tried in vain to steady it The big mainsail was bunched up, a vast, portentous shape above him, and he set his lips, and pulled up the helm another spoke as it swung.|$|E
60|$|They let the jib fly, {{and jumping}} for the <b>mainsheet</b> hauled {{with all their}} might, while Jake helped them with one hand as the boat {{came up to the}} wind. Then as a comber fell upon her they sprang back to the {{jibsheet}} and hauled upon it, while the spray flew all over them. It struck Frank that if the boat did not come round there would very speedily be an end of her. While he watched, holding his breath, the bows swung around a little farther, and working in frantic haste they let the sheet fly and made fast the opposite one, which was now to lee. She forged ahead on the other tack--and the most imminent peril was past.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later Vane closed with the beach, and a break in the hillside, which was dotted with wind-stunted pines, opened up. While the two men {{struggled}} with the <b>mainsheet,</b> the big boom and the sail above it lurched madly over. The sloop rolled down until half her deck on one side was in the sea, but she hove herself up again and shot forward, wet and gleaming, into a space of smooth green water behind a head. Soon afterward, Vane luffed into a tiny bay, where she rode upright in the sunshine, with loose canvas flapping softly in a faint breeze while the cable rattled down. They got the canoe over, and when they had helped Mrs. Marvin and her little girl, both of whom looked very wobegone and the worse for the voyage, into her, Vane glanced around.|$|E
60|$|He {{put down}} his helm, and the sloop, forging round to windward, rose upright, with her heavy mainboom banging to and fro. After that, they were desperately busy {{for the next few}} minutes, and Vane wished they had engaged a hand in Vancouver, instead of waiting to hire a Siwash somewhere up the coast. There was a headsail to haul to windward, which was difficult, and the <b>mainsheet</b> to get in; and then the two men, {{standing}} on the slippery inclined deck, struggled hard to haul the canvas down to the boom. The jerking spar smote them in the ribs; once or twice the reefing tackle beneath it was torn from their hands; but they mastered the sail, tying two reefs in it, to reduce its size, and the craft afterwards drove away with her lee rail just awash.|$|E
60|$|The craft {{was coming}} round with her stern to the wind, {{and as she}} did so the canoe came up {{on the top of a}} sea and struck her with a crash. Frank had, however, no thought to spare for her. He was {{dragging}} at the <b>mainsheet</b> as the big boom tilted up into the darkness above his head, while the sloop rolled heavily. Then the upper part of the bagging sail swung over with a bang and he whipped the rope around something as the heavy spar followed it. The sloop rolled at the same time until half her deck was in the sea, the sheet was torn furiously through his hands, and the canoe hit her with another heavy thud as she swayed up again. Then it drove astern, and Frank had space to gather his breath and look about him as they swept on into smoother water.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was willing}} to learn all right, I'll say that much. But he was constitutionally unable to learn anything. He could no more box the compass than I could mix drinks like Roberts here. And as for steering, he gave me my first gray hairs. I never dared risk him at the wheel when we were running in a big sea, while full-and-by and close-and-by were {{insoluble}} mysteries. Couldn't ever {{tell the difference between}} a sheet and a tackle, simply couldn't. The fore-throat-jig and the jib-jig were all one to him. Tell him to slack off the <b>mainsheet,</b> and before you know it, he'd drop the peak. He fell overboard three times, and he couldn't swim. But he was always cheerful, never seasick, and he was the most willing man I ever knew. He was an uncommunicative soul. Never talked about himself. His history, so far as we were concerned, began the day he signed on the DUCHESS. Where he learned to shoot, the stars alone can tell. He was a Yankee--that much we knew from the twang in his speech. And that was all we ever did know.|$|E
60|$|He fancied {{he cried}} out in warning, but was never sure of it, though three men came running to seize the <b>mainsheet.</b> The {{schooner}} fell off a little, swinging until the boom-foresail came over with a thunderous bang and crash. She rolled down, heaving a wide strip of wet planking out of the sea, and now {{for a moment or}} two there were great breadths of canvas swung out on either hand. Then the ponderous mainboom went up high above his head, and he saw three shadowy figures dragged aft as they tried in vain to steady it. The big mainsail was bunched up, a vast, portentous shape above him, and then he set his lips, and pulled up the helm another spoke as it swung. He never quite knew what happened after that. There was a horrible crash, and the schooner appeared to be rolling over bodily. The spokes he clung to desperately reft themselves from his grasp, the deck slanted until one could not stand upon it, and something heavy struck him on the head. He dropped, and Dampier flung himself upon the wheel above his senseless body.|$|E
