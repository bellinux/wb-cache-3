Pt.Shukla in those days was residing in Andher-Deo. It was here that Bhawani Devi fell a victim of the dreaded plague. It was as if plague was now testing Pandit Shukla. With courage he nursed Bhawani Devi. He treated her with both the Ayurvedic system and modern medicine. The doctor advised him to administer <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> to her. Born in a stout Vaishnav family where staunch vegetarianism was practised for generations, to save her life, he decided to experiment with doctor’s advice and served her Brand’s Essence of Mutton and Chicken. The Vaidya advised him to administer her the mica-ash. With the spread of the epidemic the servants and the milkman died and the entire neighborhood was empty. He heartily continued nursing her on a day and night battle which lasted a full month and five days and finally saved her from the clutches of the dreaded disease. As soon as she was out of danger he decided to immediately move to Rajnandgaon. On 20 January 1903 he reached Rajnandgaon and, now that she was cured, he garlanded her with empty tin cans of Brand’s Essence and explained to her how he was compelled to resort to this treatment to save her life.|$|E

50|$|Meat extract {{was invented}} by Baron Justus von Liebig, a German 19th-century organic chemist.

Fuelled by a desire to help feed the undernourished, in 1840 he developed a concentrated beef extract, Extractum carnis Liebig, to provide a nutritious meat substitute for those unable to afford the real thing. However, it took 30 kg of meat to produce 1 kg of extract, making the extract too expensive.|$|R
50|$|However it is {{possible}} to significantly reduce carcinogens when grilling meat, or mitigate their effect. Garlic, rosemary, olive oil, cherries, and vitamin E have been shown to reduce formation of both HCAs and PAHs. V-profiled grill elements placed at an angle may help drain much of the <b>meat</b> <b>juices</b> and dripping fat, and transport them away from the heat source. Heat sources on the top (as in many electrical or gas ovens), or on the side (vertical grilling) avoid completely the burning of fat dripping from the meat, and the meat's contact with the flames. Another method is precooking the meat in the microwave, which can reduce HCA formation by reducing the time that meat must be in contact with high heat to finish cooking.|$|R
40|$|Tomatoes are a {{rich source}} of antioxidants; and they are {{commonly}} used for meat cooking in Mediterranean countries. The effects of tomato antioxidants on the formation of carcinogenic/mutagenic heterocyclic amines were investigated.

A freeze-dried bovine <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> (<b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> model system) was also used for some experiments. In both model systems, an inhibiting effect of tomato carotenoid fraction on the formation of imidazoquinolines (IQx, MeIQx and DiMeIQx) was observed.

40|$|Acute phase {{proteins}} (APPs) determination {{in different}} fluids like serum, saliva and <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> measured with ultrasensitive assays {{can be used}} to evaluate the disease status of porcine populations under field conditions. Liver is the main production site of serum APPs, but the origin of APPs that can be determined in body fluids different from blood remains unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} clarify the origin of three APPs: C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) in saliva and <b>meat</b> <b>juice.</b> The mRNA expression of these proteins was measured in liver, salivary gland and diaphragmatic muscle by quantitative PCR and compared with the protein levels in serum, saliva and <b>meat</b> <b>juice,</b> respectively in healthy and naturally diseased animals. As expected, concentrations of all APP were significantly higher in all body fluids from diseased animals. Levels of all APPs mRNA were very low in diaphragmatic muscle tissue, and the expression was independent of the disease status. In contrast, we found higher expression levels of SAA and Hp mRNA in the salivary gland of diseased animals, while CRP mRNA was not detected. Our data indicate that the APP present in <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> derived predominantly from serum. This assumption is also supported by the good correlation of the levels of both proteins in <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> with those in serum. Further, the lower variability of the APP levels within the two groups of animals, suggests <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> as an alternate sampling material. The APP levels that are determined in saliva, however, appear to result from an increased local production except for CRP, indicating that the salivary gland responds to disease.

Changes in the concentrations of Hp and CRP in serum, saliva and <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> samples were similar, peaking at 21 dpi.

Aims: Monitoring for Salmonella in {{slaughter}} pigs {{is important to}} enable targeted control {{measures to be applied}} on problem farms and at the abattoir. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether pooled serum and <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> could be used to identify finishing pig herds with a high prevalence of infection. Methods and Results: Samples of <b>meat</b> <b>juice,</b> serum, caecal contents, carcase swabs and pooled faeces from pig pens were taken from 20 commercial pig finishing farms and comparisons were made between the results of Salmonella culture, individual ELISA tests on serum and <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> and pooled samples of serum and <b>meat</b> <b>juice.</b> Salmonella was isolated from samples from 19 of 20 farms. None of the ELISA tests showed a statistically significant correlation with caecal carriage of Salmonella or contamination of carcases. Serum mean optical density (O. D.) from pools of five, 10 or 20 sera showed a significant correlation with the Salmonella status of farm pen faeces. All pooled serum O. D. and sample/positive control ratio results correlated significantly with the results of the conventional individual sample ELISA. There was a statistically significant correlation between the incidence of Salmonella in farm pen pooled faeces and the prevalence of Salmonella in caeca of {{slaughter pigs}}. Conclusions: The results show a generally poor correlation between serological and bacteriological results but pooled serum or <b>meat</b> <b>juice</b> samples could be used as a cheaper substitute for serological screening of farms for Salmonella than individual samples. Significance and Impact of the Study: The availability of a cheaper test should allow the costs of Salmonella monitoring of pig farms to be reduced or allow more regular testing to enhance the designation of farm Salmonella risk status...|$|E
