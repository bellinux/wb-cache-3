40|$|Post-lumbar {{puncture}} headache is {{the most}} common complication of lumbar puncture. This condition is thought {{to be the result of}} persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the puncture site, leading to low cerebrospinal fluid pressure and traction on the meninges and intracranial veins. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, auditory and vestibular symptoms. <b>Meningeal</b> irritation <b>signs</b> are unexpected as clinical findings unless serious medical conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis occur. We are present a case of headache and meningismus following by lumbar puncture. A 17 -year-old female presented to the emergency department suffering from headache, nausea and vomiting, starting one day after a lumbar puncture procedure. The characteristics of the headache were different and more severe than the previous form. Her vital signs and physical and detailed neurological examination were normal, except meningismus findings such as neck stiffness and Brudzinksy’s sign. Since the meningismus findings were unexpected, lumbar puncture was performed again to diagnose meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure, protein, glucose, microscopic examination, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were normal. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no pathological meningeal enhancement. In patients harboring uncontrollable factors, variables such as needle size, bevel orientation and the avoidance of traumatic lumbar puncture should be taken into consideration more seriously than ever. Furthermore, since, <b>meningeal</b> irritation <b>signs</b> such as neck stiffness and Brudzinksy’s and Kernig’s signs are not the expected clinical findings of post-lumbar puncture headache, serious medical conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and meningeal infections should be investigated in the emergency setting...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since delayed {{diagnosis}} and treatment of bacterial meningitis worsens patient prognosis, clinicians have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture or to start empiric antibiotic treatment in patients suspected of having meningitis. OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision rule, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices and clinical characteristics, to determine whether empiric antibiotic treatment should be started in children with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> DESIGN: Multivariable logistic regression analysis of retrospectively collected data. Bacterial meningitis was defined as a CSF leukocyte count of more than 5 / micro L with positive bacterial culture findings from CSF or blood specimens. SETTING: Pediatric emergency department of a pediatric university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 227 children (aged 1 month to 15 years) with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The diagnostic value of adding early obtainable CSF indices to clinical characteristics to predict bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Independent predictors of bacterial meningitis from early obtainable CSF indices were the CSF polymorphonuclear leukocyte count and the CSF-blood glucose ratio. The diagnostic value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of this CSF model was 0. 93. Application of the model together with clinical characteristics could predict early the absence of bacterial meningitis in 69 (30 %) of the 227 patients so that empiric antibiotic treatment could be safely withheld. CONCLUSION: A diagnostic decision rule that uses clinical characteristics at admission, the CSF polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and the CSF-blood glucose ratio is a useful tool for deciding whether to start empiric antibiotics in children with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pyogenic {{ventriculitis}} is a {{rare and}} severe cerebral infection characterized {{by the presence of}} suppurative fluid in the cerebral ventricles. It is a life-threatening condition and may present with an aspecific neurological picture. Brain imaging techniques usually demonstrate intraventricular debris and pus, but negative imaging along with a misleading clinical picture may delay the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The described patient underwent a number of surgical procedures and eventually developed an unusual clinical picture characterized by psychomotor slowing, facial dyskinesias and myoclonic jerks without complaint of headache and in absence of <b>meningeal</b> irritation <b>signs</b> or focal neurological deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid cultural examination showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin treatment lead to a complete recovery. Brain computed tomography scan was normal, while only diffusion magnetic resonance imaging sequences were able to define the presence of purulent material within the brain lateral ventriculi. CONCLUSION: The present case underlines the importance of taking into account the diagnosis of pyogenic ventriculitis even when the neurological picture does not match the suspect of a central nervous system infection. Moreover, brain computed tomography scan and standard magnetic resonance imaging sequences may be unable to confirm the diagnosis, whereas diffusion-weighted sequences prove a unique role in diagnosing cerebral pyogenic ventriculitis...|$|R

The objective of the present article is to describe one case of postoperative injected mercury dissemination. A 19 -year-old man presented severe neck pain including <b>meningeal</b> irritation <b>sign</b> and abdominal pain after injection of mercury for the purpose of suicide. Radiologic study showed injected mercury in the neck involving high cervical epidural space and subcutaneous layer of abdomen. Partial hemilaminectomy and open mercury evacuation of spinal canal was performed. For the removal of abdominal subcutaneous mercury, C-arm guided needle aspiration was done. After surgery, radiologic study showed disseminated mercury in the lung, heart, skull base and low spinal canal. Neck pain and abdominal pain were improved after surgery. During 1 month after surgery, there was no symptom of mercury intoxication except increased mercury concentration of urine, blood and hair. We assumed the bone work during surgery might have caused mercury dissemination. Therefore, we recommend minimal invasive surgical technique for removal of injected mercury. If open exposures are needed, cautious surgical technique to prohibit mercury dissemination is necessary and normal barrier should be protected to prevent the migration of mercury...|$|R

All the patients were examined daily by {{the same group of}} neurologists, using a standardized neurological examination. Patients with signs of encephalic lesions, unsatisfactory response to antibiotics or decreased level of consciousness were submitted to brain computer tomography. The overall lethality rate was 20. 3 % and cases whose causative agent was identified presented a higher lethality rate (23. 7 %) than those in which the agent was not found. The most important neurological abnormalities were <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> (88. 3 %) followed by decreased consciousness (47. 7 %), irritability (35. 2 %), seizures (22. 4 %), fontanel bulging (20. 6 %) and cranial nerve palsy (14. 2 %).

Methods Clinical data of 3 patients with NSCLC-LM collected from January 2015 to June 2016 were analyzed with a brief review. Results All 3 patients had adenocarcinoma histology harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 21 point mutations (m). Of the 3 cases, 1 was male, 2 were female. The mean age was 61. 3 years (range, 59 - 64 years). The main clinical manifestations and positive physical examination included headache (3 / 3), dizziness (3 / 3), nausea (3 / 3) and vomiting (3 / 3), epilepsy (2 / 3), diplopia (1 / 3), hearing loss (1 / 3) and <b>meningeal</b> stimulation <b>sign</b> (3 / 3). The median time from symptom to diagnosis of LM was 2. 3 months (range, 1 to 4 months). Except 1 patient with lung cancer and LM diagnosised at the same time, the other 2 cases received the diagnosis of LM after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy or chemotherapy respectively, the median time from diagnosis of NSCLC to LC was 8. 5 months.

Complications and sequele are more common in the group of sick children without antibiotic therapy before diagnosing bacterial meningitis. However, the presence of sequele in the group of children which were treated with antibiotics before completed diagnostics showed that treatment of bacterial meningitis must be done in a more effective way as well as an early antibiotics treatment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Serious {{infections in}} {{children}} (sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, and cellulitis) {{are associated with}} considerable mortality and morbidity. In children with an acute illness, the primary care physician uses signs and symptoms to assess {{the probability of a}} serious infection and decide on further management. AIM: To analyse the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms, and to create a multivariable triage instrument. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Primary care in Belgium. METHOD: Children aged 0 - 16 years with an acute illness for a maximum of 5 days were included consecutively. Signs and symptoms were recorded and compared to the final outcome of these children (a serious infection for which hospitalisation was necessary). Accuracy was analysed bivariably. Multivariable triage instruments were constructed using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3981 children were included in the study, of which 31 were admitted to hospital with a serious infection (0. 78 %). Accuracy of signs and symptoms was fairly low. Classical textbook <b>signs</b> (<b>meningeal</b> irritation impaired peripheral circulation) had high specificity. The primary classification tree consisted of five knots and had sensitivity of 96. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 83. 3 to 99. 9), specificity 88. 5 % (95 % CI = 87. 5 to 89. 5), positive predictive value 6. 2 % (95 % CI = 4. 2 to 8. 7), and negative predictive value 100. 0 % (95 % CI = 99. 8 to 100. 0), by which a serious infection can be excluded in children testing negative on the tree. The sign paramount in all trees was the physician's statement 'something is wrong'. CONCLUSION: Some individual signs have high specificity. A serious infection can be excluded based on a limited number of signs and symptoms...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a kidney transplant recipient who developed meningococcemia, without <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs,</b> 2 months after transplantation. Plasma levels of complement components C 3, C 4, and CH 50 were within the normal range. However, using a method to screen for the functional activity of all 3 pathways of complement, no activation via the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway could be detected (0 %). A subsequent quantification of MBL pathway components revealed normal levels of MASP 2 but undetectable amounts of MBL. To our knowledge, this is the first report of meningococcal disease after organ transplantation in a patient with MBL deficiency...|$|E
