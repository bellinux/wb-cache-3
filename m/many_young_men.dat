5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{household}} included <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of ability, {{including his}} successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in}} the early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E

5|$|Rupert {{arrived in}} England {{following}} his period of imprisonment and final release from captivity in Germany. In August 1642, Rupert, {{along with his}} brother Prince Maurice {{and a number of}} professional soldiers, ran the gauntlet across the sea from the United Provinces, and after one initial failure, evaded the pro-Parliamentary navy and landed in Newcastle. Riding across country, he found the King with a tiny army at Leicester Abbey, and was promptly appointed General of Horse, a coveted appointment at the time in European warfare. Rupert set about recruiting and training: with great effort he had put together a partially trained mounted force of 3,000 cavalry by the end of September. Rupert's reputation continued to rise and, leading a sudden, courageous charge, he routed a Parliamentarian force at Powick Bridge, the first military engagement of the war. Although a small engagement, this had a propaganda value far exceeding the importance of the battle itself, and Rupert became an heroic figure for <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in the Royalist camp.|$|E
5|$|The loss of so <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{during the}} Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club was fighting for Third Division survival.|$|E

Many launches were to ships that had been torpedoed or struck mines, including naval or merchant vessels on war duty; a notable example was the hospital ship [...] which foundered in 1914 and was attended by six lifeboats, saving 144 lives over a 50-hour rescue mission.|$|R

25|$|Growth was rapid after 1700, as Scottish ports, {{especially}} {{those on the}} Clyde, began to import tobacco from the American colonies. Scottish industries, especially linen manufacturing, were developed.

Of the total enlistment, more than 130,000 were foreign-born, including 20,000 from British North American possessions such as Canada. 51,000 were Irish and 37,000 German. The average age of the New York soldiers was 25 years, 7 months, although <b>many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>men</b> and boys may have lied about their age in order to enlist.|$|R
50|$|In the military, {{there are}} {{specific}} rules about {{when and where}} to wear a hat. Hats are generally worn outdoors only, at sea {{as well as on}} land; however, personnel carrying firearms typically also wear their hats indoors. Removing one's hat is also a form of salute. Many schools also have this rule {{due to the fact that}} <b>many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>men</b> tend to wear baseball caps and this being in relations to gangs depending on the side in which the hat is worn.|$|R
25|$|The Generals grew a {{reputation}} for treating its players well and signed <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> who {{would go on to}} National Hockey League fame. Players were admitted free to theatres, dancing, wrestling, roller skating and other attractions at the arena. Sponsors gave full scholarships to school and weekly stipends. Through the whole dynasty, the team was managed by Matt Leyden, and its secretary was Neil Hezzlewood. Both men would be inducted in the Oshawa Sports Hall of fame.|$|E
25|$|In late 1915, however, German generals {{were given}} control and invaded Serbia with Austrian and Bulgarian forces.

Instead Austria tried to depoliticize Serbia, to minimize violence, and {{to integrate the}} country into the Empire. Nevertheless, Serbian nationalism remained defiant and <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> slipped out to help rebuild the Serbian army in exile.|$|E
25|$|Australia's last Test before First World War {{was against}} New Zealand in July 1914. The war {{had a very}} {{negative}} effect on rugby union in Australia. All rugby union competitions in New South Wales and Queensland ceased during the War after the state bodies decided it was inappropriate to play football when so <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were fighting overseas. This resulted in competitions all but closed down in New South Wales and Queensland. In Queensland regular competitions did not commence again until 1928. This caused many players to switch to rugby league – which did not cease playing during the war.|$|E
