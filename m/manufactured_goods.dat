40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the welfare effect of {{international}} migration under {{the existence of}} trans-boundary pollution. We use a simplified Copeland and Taylor (1999) model? a two-country, two-sector and two-factor Ricardian general equilibrium model. The developed Home country (under-developed Foreign country) is superior (inferior) {{in terms of the}} pollution abatement technology and thus it has relative advantage in the production of the environmentally sensitive agricultural <b>good</b> (the <b>manufactured</b> <b>good</b> which emits pollution). If there is no trade, workers will migrate from the Foreign country to the Home country. Regardless of the method of remittance, generally speaking the Foreign country gains from migration, but whether the Home country gains depends on the technology gap and the magnitude of trans-boundary pollution. If a free trade equilibrium exists, international migration occurs when the demand for the <b>manufactured</b> <b>good</b> is not large and thus the Home country specializes in the production of <b>manufactured</b> <b>good.</b> Migration will expand the production of the <b>manufactured</b> <b>good</b> as well as international trade. ...|$|R

This was not an insignificant number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare.

It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload their cargo inside buildings.

5|$|The {{importance}} of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed. Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance, supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry's products. By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub {{of a network of}} forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> as far afield as the West Indies. These trading links gave Birmingham's metalworkers access to much wider markets, allowing them to diversify away from lower-skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale, towards a broader range of specialist, higher-skilled and more lucrative activities.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|By 1904 {{the line}} was {{operating}} fourteen steamships of between four and seven thousand tons, several built by the associated Furness Withy shipyards. Services to ports in eastern Canada were supplemented by regular sailings to Boston, Philadelphia, and the southern US cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Between 1904 and 1908 ML deployed three vessels including the Manchester City to the River Plate route, serving other UK ports as well Manchester. The main return cargo was frozen and chilled meat, and the City set a record for the largest meat consignment up to that time. Lord Furness, as he had become, died in 1912 and was succeeded as ML's chairman by R. B. Stoker {{until his death in}} 1919.

5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made an arm of British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{economic}} issues {{played a role}} in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, coffee from the West Indies began to replace tea in the United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an overstocked market, resulting in bankruptcies and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826–27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841–43, following the Panic of 1837.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the growth {{slowdown}} in Japan in the 1990 s was a consequence of an adverse terms-of-trade shock that {{was due to the}} emergence of low cost producers of <b>manufacture</b> <b>goods.</b> Prior to the 1990 s Japan had achieved a significant cost advantage in producing various <b>manufacture</b> <b>goods,</b> which led to an allocation of resources towards this sector. Indeed, the fraction of resources in the manufacture sector in Japan exceeded that of other countries in a similar stage of development. The emergence of largely populated developing countries, such as China, lowered the relative price of <b>manufacture</b> <b>goods</b> to that of primary commodities and capital. The response by Japan was classic: a reallocation of resources from the manufacture sector to the service sector, a fall in the price of service goods, an overall fall in the stock of capital, and a fall in output. The sustained rise of manufactureintensive developing countries throughout the 90 s led to the growth slowdown in Japan. This paper examines the available data to support this argument and develops a model to capture the various dependencies observed in the data and to make the interpretation of the data precise. ...|$|R

Australia's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food, materials and <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> needed for the defeat of Japan. As a result of this policy, the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards, though an offensive force of six infantry divisions (three AIF and three Militia divisions) was maintained {{until the end of the}} war. In early 1944 all but two of the Army's divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation. However, several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment. These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign, and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year.|$|E
