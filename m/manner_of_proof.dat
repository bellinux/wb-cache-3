I have no doubt that he credits me with the disfavour in which he is held by the prince; but I have never even mentioned his name before him, and the prince's misliking is but the feeling which a noble and generous heart has, as though by instinct, against one who is false and treacherous. At the same time we must grant that this traitor knight is a bold and fearless man-at-arms; he fought well at La Blanche Tache and Cressy, and he is much liked and trusted by my lord of Northampton, in whose following he mostly rides; 'tis a pity that one so brave should have so foul and treacherous a heart.

40|$|After {{more than}} 200 years, the Full Faith and Credit Clause remains poorly understood. The Clause first issues a {{self-executing}} command (that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given”), and then gives Congress power to prescribe the <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and the “Effect” of state records in other states. But if states must accord each other full faith and credit—and if {{nothing could be}} more than full—then what “Effect” could Congress give state records that they wouldn’t have already? And conversely, how could Congress in any way reduce or alter the faith and credit that is due? This article seeks to answer these questions in light of Congress’s early efforts, from the Founding to the 1820 s, to “declare the Effect” of state records—efforts which have largely escaped the notice of current scholarship on the Clause. Together with pre-Founding documents and the decisions of influential state courts, they suggest that the Clause was not generally understood to mandate the effect of state records in other states, but rather to leave such determinations to the legislative branch. Indeed, early interpreters of the Clause attributed far less importance to its first self-executing sentence, which was often understood as a rule of evidence, and far more importance to the Congressional power to determine substantive effect. Recovering this original meaning not only saves the Clause from obscurity, but also offers opportunities for deliberation and legislative choice over the structure of our federal system.

40|$|In {{adopting}} Bill 89, the National Assembly, {{while retaining}} {{most of the}} wording of the rules proposed by the Civil Code Revision Office, has changed their order and arrangement. This may entail substantive alterations. The first part of this paper shows that, on a first reading at least, the new provisions display some consistency. The terms « legitimacy » and « legitimate » are no longer used; children are treated alike, especially as regards the <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> whether they be born from wedlock or not. Maternity and paternity may now be proved by similar means. The various modes of proof are now hierarchically listed : first come acts of birth, followed in sequence of subsidiarity by possession of status, presumption as to the husband's paternity, and recognition. The traditional presumption is therefore significantly downgraded. In litigated cases, the action to disavow paternity is now open not only to the mother's husband, but also to the mother herself. Status may be challenged and a different one may be sought whenever the act of birth and possession of status are not congruent. Biological truth is given precedence over the protection of legitimacy In {{the second part of the}} paper, however, some inconsistencies in the new provisions are brought out. They relate mainly to two issues. The new provisions purportedly make no distinction between the proof of maternity and that of paternity. Yet, while maternity may be proved directly, the proof of paternity must remain somewhat uncertain, hence the use of presumptions. Most useful among these is the presumption as to the husband's paternity : yet the new provisions confine it to a very subsidiary role. According to the new scheme of rules, it is questionable whether anyone other than the mother's husband may rely on them to disavow paternity when his name appears on the act of birth. The new provisions also purport to abandon the concept of legitimacy. This, it might be claimed, entails the abandonment of marriage itself. Yet, not only does the new Code preserve marriage, but it also denies recognition to the union de fait. Neither have the presumption as to the husband's paternity, or the disavowal of children, been eradicated from the new provisions. The paper concludes by foreseeing many difficulties in the application of the new rules as to the proof of paternal filiation...|$|E
