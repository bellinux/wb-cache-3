Being <b>multishell,</b> the well-defined atomic periodicity is hardly realized in it because the periodic units of individual shells therein generally do not match except for very few cases, posing a challenge to understand its physical properties. Here we show that moiré patterns generated by superimposing atomic lattices of individual shells are decisive in determining its electronic structures. Double- walled carbon nanotubes, as an example, are shown to have spectacular variations in their electronic properties from metallic to semiconducting and further to insulating states depending on their moiré patterns, even when they are composed of only semiconducting nanotubes with almost similar energy gaps and diameters. Thus, aperiodic <b>multishell</b> nanowires can be classified into new one-dimensional moiré crystals with distinct electronic structures. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: In {{diffusion}} MRI, {{a technique}} known as diffusion spectrum imaging reconstructs the propagator with a discrete Fourier transform, from a Cartesian {{sampling of the}} diffusion signal. Alternatively, {{it is possible to}} directly reconstruct the orientation distribution function in q-ball imaging, providing so-called high angular resolution diffusion imaging. In between these two techniques, acquisitions on several spheres in q-space offer an interesting trade-off between the angular resolution and the radial information gathered in diffusion MRI.

40|$|Many {{diffusion}} MRI researchers, {{including the}} Human Connectome Project (HCP), acquire data using <b>multishell</b> (e. g., WU-Minn consortium) and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) schemes (e. g., USC-Harvard consortium). However, these data sets are not readily accessible to high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) analysis methods that are popular in connectomics analysis. Here we introduce a scheme conversion approach that transforms <b>multishell</b> and DSI data into their corresponding HARDI representations, thereby empowering HARDI-based analytical methods {{to make use}} of data acquired using non-HARDI approaches. This method was evaluated on both phantom and in-vivo human data sets by acquiring <b>multishell,</b> DSI, and HARDI data simultaneously, and comparing the converted HARDI, from non-HARDI methods, with the original HARDI data. Analysis on the phantom shows that the converted HARDI from DSI and <b>multishell</b> data strongly predicts the original HARDI (correlation coefficient > 0. 9). Our in-vivo study shows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical deconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with those from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion method can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to sacrifice angular resolution.

40|$|CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibit {{interesting}} opto-electronic properties. For example, {{they have}} narrow excitonic features and {{can therefore be}} used as monochromatic light emitters. Synthesis methods for CdSe NPLs emitting at 460 nm (460 NPLs), 510 nm (510 NPLs) and 550 nm (550 NPLs) were reported by Dubertret et al. This thesis reports that these synthesis methods are reproducible and that {{the surface of the}} NPLs can be modified. The knowledge obtained from investigating surface modifications of quantum dots and nanorods could be used to modify the surface of the NPLs. This resulted in the formation of CdSe/CdS core/shell NPLs. A CdS/Cd 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 S/ZnS shell using SILAR with oleyl amine as a coordination ligand was also synthesized. Synthesis of <b>multishell</b> quantum dots results in particles with a high quantum yield (QY), but the QY of the <b>multishell</b> NPLs was reduced compared to bare NPLs. Furthermore, the thickness of the <b>multishell</b> NPLs was not homogeneous. The edge of the particle was thicker and an excess of cadmium and sulphur could be found at the edge. Zinc and selenium were homogeneously distributed in the <b>multishell</b> NPLs. A second modification reported in this thesis is the cadmium-to-mercury ion-exchange of CdSe NPLs, but this modification did not result in stable dispersions of NPLs. The exchange was only partially successful on CdSe QDs with a <b>multishell.</b> Furthermore, an adaptation to the synthesis of 510 NPLs is reported. Instead of adding only cadmium acetate during the reaction, a mixture of cadmium- and sodium acetate was added. The cadmium acetate is added during the reaction to induce 2 D growth, but addition of different acetate salts also resulted in the formation of CdSe NPLs. When cadmium acetate is added, a small amount of thicker or thinner NPLs are present in the sample. Addition of a mixture of sodium acetate and cadmium acetate resulted in the formation of 510 NPLs only with a high QY of 60 %. The optical properties of CdSe NPLs are also investigated. Plausible energy transfer is observed between NPLs. The fluorescence intensity decay of the NPLs is multi-exponential. Photoluminescent lifetime measurements on NPLs in solvents with different refractive indices showed that none of the components of the multi-exponential decay are predominantly radiative. Trends obtained with these measurement could not be fitted by the models used in literature...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of papers which derives the matrix {{elements}} of the spin-dependent U(2 n) generators in a <b>multishell</b> spin-orbit basis, i. e., a spin adapted composite Gelfand-Paldus basis. The advantages of such a <b>multishell</b> formalism are well known and well documented. The approach taken exploits the properties of the U(n) adjoint tensor operator denoted by Delta(j) (i) (1 less than or equal to i,j less than or equal to n) as defined by Gould and Paldus [IJ. Chem. Phys. 92, 7394 (1990) ]. Delta is a polynomial of degree two in the U(n) matrix E=[E(j) (i) ]. The unique properties of this operator allow the construction of adjoint coupling coefficients for the zero-shift components of the U(2 n) generators. The Racah factorization lemma may then be applied to obtain the matrix elements of all the U(2 n) generators. In this paper we investigate the underlying formalism of the approach and discuss its advantages and its relationship to the shift operator method of Gould and Battle [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 5961 (1993) ]. The formalism is then applied, in the second paper of the series, to calculate the matrix elements of the del operator in a two-shell spin-orbit basis. This immediately yields the zero-shift adjoint coupling coefficients in such a basis. The del-operator matrix elements are required for the calculation of spin densities in a two-shell basis. In the third paper of the series we derive the remaining nonzero shift adjoint coupling coefficients all of which are required for the <b>multishell</b> case. We then use these coupling coefficients to obtain formulas for the matrix elements of the U(2 n) generators in a two-shell spin-orbit basis. This result is then generalized, in the fourth paper, to the case of the <b>multishell</b> spin-orbit basis. Finally, we demonstrate that in the Gefand-Tsetlin limit the formula obtained is equivalent to that of Gould and Battle for a single-shell system. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

In particular, hollow and/or <b>multishelled</b> Zn 1 -xCoxO cores (in wurtzite phase) serve as a support for the nanospheres of Co 1 -yZnyO (in rock-salt phase) in this latter method. Our findings indicate that while "multi-pot" synthesis is a prevailing methodology for composite nanoparticles, simpler "one-pot" synthesis {{can be an effective}} approach for preparation of more complex nanocomposite materials, especially for interdoped metal oxides. As an example, our as-prepared binary oxide composites Zn 1 -xCoxO/Co 1 -yZnyO have shown good catalytic activity for oxidation of carbon monoxide at relatively low reaction temperatures. © 2009 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|A novel growth {{technique}} for low density, non-icosahedral carbon onion-like structures on Cu surface is described. The technique differs with {{the formation of}} carbon onions inside the C 1 + implanted metal surfaces at high temperatures with densities ~ 2 g cm- 3 in the form of <b>multishelled</b> icosahedral fullerenes wrapped around C 60. We report spheroidal cage formation of shell with variable shell thickness, radii and curvature on C 1 +-irradiated Cu surfaces by the accumulating C atoms which emerge out of the edges of the implanted sheets and grids. Atom-by-atom C accreting structures grow along the edges, corners and crevices. These, in turn, form the open and closed multiple-shelled cages. Variable curvature is the most common feature of the growing structures. The growth at room temperature does not ensure sphericity of the cages due to the absence of high temperature annealing. These cages have very low density, hollow interiors and often exhibit the conspicuous cage-inside-cage structures. Another feature of the as-grown, non-spherical onions is the existence of spherical protrusions with different local radii within the same cage. Formation of cages with sizes ~ few nanometer to hundreds of nanometer depends upon the irradiation rate of C 1 +. In situ formation and transformations of the cages observed under 120 keV electron beam irradiation is described by using a nanoelastic model. Comment: 28 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
