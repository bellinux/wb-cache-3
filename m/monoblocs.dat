50|$|Honda {{produces}} {{many other}} head-block-crankcase <b>monoblocs</b> under {{a variety of}} different names, such as the GXV-series. They may all be externally identified by a gasket which would bisect the crankshaft on an approximately 45° angle.|$|E
50|$|The last of {{the sealed}} {{anamorphic}} <b>monoblocs,</b> the 2005 was built out of the cheap I.O.R.-made second iteration of the Pentacon Prakticar 50mm 2.4 pancake lens. The Iscorama 2005 was multicoated and had a Praktica B Mount.|$|E
50|$|Final {{sale price}} auction data {{indicate}} that the Iscorama 54 and original 1960s Iscorama are the most valuable of the true DSLR compatible Iscoramas (the projector lenses are worth relatively little), whilst the 2000 series sealed <b>monoblocs</b> fetch the least at auction.|$|E
50|$|The last {{engines to}} make {{widespread}} use of <b>monobloc</b> cylinder heads were large air-cooled aircraft radial engines, such as the Wasp Major. These have individual cylinder barrels, so access as a <b>monobloc</b> is less restricted than on inline engine. As they are also of high specific power and require the utmost reliability, {{the advantages of the}} <b>monobloc</b> remained attractive.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, any use of {{the term}} {{describes}} a deliberate single-unit construction, opposed to the more common contemporary practice. Where the <b>monobloc</b> technique has later become the norm, the specific term falls from favour. It is now usual and un-noteworthy practice to use <b>monobloc</b> cylinders and crankcases, but a <b>monobloc</b> head (for a water-cooled inline engine at least) would be regarded as peculiar and obsolescent.|$|R
40|$|Crouzon {{syndrome}} (CS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures, midface and supraorbital ridge retrusion, exorbitism, {{and in some}} clinical scenarios strabismus, parrot-beaked nose, short upper lip and hypertelorbitism. Treatment of CS is overlapped {{with the beginning of}} craniofacial surgery and is grounded on morphologic and functional objectives. The authors reported on the outcomes and complications of family members (mother and 2 siblings) with CS, who were operated on by different techniques of frontofacial advancement and have attained skeletal maturity. Operations were performed in different moments throughout the last 3 decades of craniofacial surgery history. A 10 -year-old Crouzon progenitor underwent a <b>monobloc</b> osteotomy with acute advancement, using rigid fixation and bone grafting in the osteotomy sites. An 8 -year-old Crouzon daughter underwent gradual lengthening of a <b>monobloc</b> segment, using an external, institutionally made distracter device. In addition, a 10 -year-old Crouzon son underwent gradual lengthening of a <b>monobloc</b> segment associated to facial bipartition, using an internal distracter device. After 30 years, the mother presented a mild relapse on the orbit level, but her children had satisfactory stable outcomes. The family members with CS have undergone different modifications of the <b>monobloc</b> approach based on different chronological momentum, from acute <b>monobloc</b> advancement, to <b>monobloc</b> distraction, to <b>monobloc</b> facial bipartition distraction...|$|R
5000|$|The company {{originated}} {{as a small}} {{hardware store}} in Palam, Delhi in May, 1984 by brothers Avinash and Amit Jain and was then known as [...] "Jain Brothers". Arise established its first manufacturing workshop in 1992 in Sonipat, Haryana. It specializes in <b>monoblocs</b> and submersibles pump sets and batteries. Another unit at Kala Amb, Himachal Pradesh manufactures UPS systems, inverters and gas and electric geysers.|$|E
50|$|Catalogues {{dating from}} c1910-1914 {{shows that the}} company made 4-cylinder {{automotive}} engines in five different sizes, fitted to 'Abeille' de Mesmay (AM) automobiles (models AM 1-5), vans (fr:'livraisons', AML I-III) and trucks (fr:'camions ', AMC I-II). These were sold as chassis or as complete vehicles. The cylinders of the two smaller engines were cast as <b>monoblocs,</b> the larger three had separate cylinders. Abeilles were available with different bodies ranging from 2-seater runabouts to Landaulettes, limousines and Double-Phaetons.|$|E
5000|$|Launched in 1996, the Scoot'elec {{was based}} on the Zenith, with which it shares body panels and {{suspension}} parts. It is powered by a [...] DC motor fed from three Saft nickel-cadmium <b>monoblocs</b> giving an 18 V, 100 A·h battery. Built around a [...] "double cradle", the frame holds the batteries low down between and behind the rider's feet, providing a very low centre of gravity. The electronic controller and onboard charger are housed under the seat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{communal}} {{water jacket}} of <b>monobloc</b> designs permitted closer spacing between cylinders. The <b>monobloc</b> design also improved the mechanical stiffness {{of the engine}} against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers, engine lengths, and power ratings increased.|$|R
5000|$|... 1982 saw the {{addition}} of the Iscorama 42 to the range, and in the early 1990s, ISCO introduced a new series of sealed <b>monobloc</b> 50mm focal length anamorphic lenses, plus a pair of matching anamorphic projector lenses, all under the Iscorama brand. The sealed <b>monobloc</b> and projector lenses remained on sale {{until the end of the}} Iscorama era, although it appears that they never matched the sales figures of the original detachable <b>monobloc</b> Iscorama from the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake discs}} are carbon ceramic, which shaves a {{significant}} 12.5 kg from the unsprung weight. At the front, there are 398 mm ventilated and drilled brakes with 6-piston alloy <b>monobloc</b> calipers. At the back, there are 360 mm ventilated and drilled brakes with 4-piston alloy <b>monobloc</b> calipers.|$|R
50|$|The Look 596 is {{constructed}} from high modulus carbon fibre, where aerodynamic efficiency {{was the top}} priority during the design phase. Each tube which makes up the frame is positioned to optimise airflow between the rider and the bike, with a claimed improvement in aerodynamic efficiency of 10%. The aerodynamics (and rigidity) of the bike were achieved by integration of the bottom bracket into the downtube, in one continuous piece. Like the track variant the 596 is constricted from three <b>monoblocs.</b> The front fork also acts as a fairing.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the V2 class during its service life. In 1946 a series of derailments was traced to the design of the leading pony truck, which was unduly sensitive to the often poor track conditions, a legacy of heavy wartime use and lack of maintenance. Modifications to the suspension cured the problem. During the 1950s cracked <b>monoblocs</b> became increasingly frequent, but replacement was expensive and in 1956 the decision was taken to replace the monobloc with separate cylinder castings. Seventy-one engines were thus modified: they can be identified by the presence of external steam pipes from smokebox to cylinders. Finally, around 1960 experiments were made with fitting double chimneys to two V2s. This yielded no significant performance gain, but eight engines were subsequently fitted with Kylchap exhausts. These so-called 'Super V2s' were reckoned to be fully equal in performance to the larger Pacifics. However, plans to fit Kylchap chimneys to the remainder of the class were abandoned once it became clear that replacement with diesel locomotives was imminent.|$|E
40|$|Several nonintrusive, {{continuous}} battery monitoring {{devices for}} lead-acid batteries in standby applications, such as uninterruptible power systems (UPS), are available {{today on the}} market. Some of them are using impedance measurements on every bloc of a battery string for determining the state of health of each bloc. The paper will present {{the results of an}} extensive validation test, comparing the results provided on the one hand by low cost monitoring devices {{and on the other hand}} by a full scale, laboratory impedance spectroscope. For the validation tests, accelerated ageing on many different lead-acid battery products have been performed. The batteries vary in terms of size (Ah), bloc voltage, battery brands and technologies. The targeted standby applications often use large batteries consisting of many single cells or <b>monoblocs</b> with six or twelve volts each connected in series. These batteries grow old during their utilization and show several ageing phenomena, which could lead to a reduced bridging time and, therefore, unforeseen failure of the system connected to the UPS in case of blackout. Nonhomogenous ageing of the cells or <b>monoblocs</b> is much more the normal case than homogenous ageing of all elements. The scope of the investigation is a detailed analysis on impedance as a measure for the ageing. The aim is to qualify devices and procedures for the use in UPS systems and to understand, in detail, which ageing effects can be detected at which frequencies. A low cost monitoring system has been evaluated with regard to its performance to make use of the information...|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} solution was the <b>monobloc</b> engine, where {{the block and}} head were formed as one piece. This solved the sealing problem, but complicated manufacture and maintenance. Particularly when routine maintenance still required frequent head removal for de-coking, on a <b>monobloc</b> engine this required {{the removal of the}} pistons from the crankshaft end beneath.|$|R
40|$|Resilon {{broadens}} {{the dimensions}} of endodontic adhesion by introducing the possibility of creating <b>monoblocs</b> between root canal filling materials and intraradicular dentin by using methacrylate-based sealers. The adhesive strength of Resilon to RealSeal, a methacrylate-based root canal sealer, was evaluated using a modified microshear bond testing design. Flat Resilon surfaces with different roughness were created for bonding to the sealer and compared to a composite control. The composite control exhibited mean shear strength 7. 3 to 26. 9 times {{higher than those of}} the Resilon groups. Shear strength differences among the Resilon groups of different surface roughness highlighted the contribution of micromechanical versus chemical coupling in sealer retention. Ultrastructural evidence of phase separation of polymeric components in Resilon suggested that the amount of dimethacrylate incorporated into this filled, thermoplastic composite may not yet be optimized for effective chemical coupling to methacrylate-based sealers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to determine, in a new {{experimental}} model, whether complex bioartificial <b>monoblocs</b> of relevant size and stability can be prefabricated in a defined three-dimensional design, in which the latissimus dorsi muscle serves as a natural bioreactor and the thoracodorsal vessel tree is prepared for axial construct perfusion. Eighteen sheep {{were included in the}} study, with six animals in each of three experimental groups. Vitalization of the β-tricalcium phosphate-based constructs was performed by direct application of unmodified osteogenic material from the iliac crest (group A), in vivo application of nucleated cell concentrate (NCC) from bone marrow aspirate (group B), and in vitro cultivation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) in a perfusion bioreactor system (group C). The contours of the constructs were designed digitally and transferred onto the bioartificial bone grafts using a titanium cage, which was bent over a stereolithographic model of the defined subvolume intraoperatively. At the end of the prefabrication process, only the axial vascularized constructs of group A demonstrated vital bone formation with considerable stability. In groups B and C, the applied techniques were not able to induce ectopic bone formation. The presented computer-assisted workflow allows the prefabrication of custom-made bioartificial transplants...|$|E
