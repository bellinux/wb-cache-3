25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion,</b> second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. There are no drugs or other pharmacogenomic methods that help with PIDs.|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{spontaneous}} <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> at {{one site}} is statistically correlated with recombination at other loci. In general, coincident conversion frequencies are highest for tightly linked markers and decline {{as a function}} of intermarker distance. Paradoxically, a significant fraction of mitotic gene convertants exhibits concomitant nonreciprocal segregation for multiple and widely spaced markers. We have undertaken a detailed genetic analysis of this class of mitotic recombinants. Our results indicate that <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> in yeast is frequently associated with nonreciprocal segregation of markers centromere-distal to the selected site of conversion. In addition, distal markers are often found to be mosaic within the product colonies. These observations, and others described here, suggest that a percentage of gene conversion in vegetative yeast cells is coupled to a chromosome break and repair mechanism. This hypothesis was further tested using a strain trisomic for chromosome VII which was specially marked to detect homolog-dependent repair events.

The ability of chemicals to induce such <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> can easily be monitored in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tester strain YHE 2, a derivative of strain D 7. For the detection of drug-induced <b>gene</b> <b>conversions,</b> two mutations in the TRP 5 locus are used, trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27. Here we report on the characterization of the stable allele trp 5 - 27. Our analysis revealed two relevant mutations in trp 5 - 27 : (a) a transition C to T at position 121 after ATG that results in an amber stop codon and abolishes gene expression and (b) a transversion A to T at position 1555 that creates an ochre stop codon. Simultaneous amber and ochre suppression with the suppressors SUP 3 and SUP 11, respectively, was capable of relieving the tryptophan-requiring phenotype of strains carrying the trp 5 - 27 allele. These findings have implications on the length of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> tracts in conversion events between trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27 : conversion tracts can cover several kilobases, if the site of the mutation in trp 5 - 12 lies outside of the positions mutated in trp 5 - 27.

40|$|Mitotic genome {{instability}} {{can occur}} during the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which arise from endogenous and exogenous sources. Studying {{the mechanisms of}} DNA repair in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that Homologous Recombination (HR) is a vital repair mechanism for DSBs. HR {{can result in a}} crossover event, in which the broken molecule reciprocally exchanges information with a homologous repair template. The current model of double-strand break repair (DSBR) also allows for a tract of information to non-reciprocally transfer from the template molecule to the broken molecule. These “gene conversion” events can vary in size and can occur in conjunction with a crossover event or in isolation. The frequency and size of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> in isolation and <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> associated with crossing over {{has been a source of}} debate due to the variation in systems used to detect <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> and the context in which the <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> are measured. In Chapter 2, I use an unbiased system that measures the frequency and size of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events, as well as the association of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events with crossing over between homologs in diploid yeast. We show <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> occur at a rate of 1. 3 x 10 - 6 per cell division, are either large (median 54. 0 kb) or small (median 6. 4 kb), and are associated with crossing over 43 % of the time. DSBs can arise from endogenous cellular processes such as replication and transcription. Two important RNA/DNA hybrids are involved in replication and transcription: R-loops, which form when an RNA transcript base pairs with the DNA template and displaces the non-template DNA strand, and ribonucleotides embedded into DNA (rNMPs), which arise when replicative polymerase errors insert ribonucleotide instead of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. RNaseH 1 (encoded by RNH 1) and RNaseH 2 (whose catalytic subunit is encoded by RNH 201) both recognize and degrade the RNA in within R-loops while RNaseH 2 alone recognizes, nicks, and initiates removal of rNMPs embedded into DNA. Due to their redundant abilities to act on RNA:DNA hybrids, aberrant removal of rNMPs from DNA has been thought to lead to genome instability in an rnh 201 Δ background. 	In Chapter 3, I characterize (1) non-selective genome-wide homologous recombination events and (2) crossing over on chromosome IV in mutants defective in RNaseH 1, RNaseH 2, or RNaseH 1 and RNaseH 2. Using a mutant DNA polymerase that incorporates 4 -fold fewer rNMPs than wild type, I demonstrate that the primary recombinogenic lesion in the RNaseH 2 -defective genome is not rNMPs, but rather R-loops. This work suggests different in-vivo roles for RNaseH 1 and RNaseH 2 in resolving R-loops in yeast and is consistent with R-loops, not rNMPs, being the the likely source of pathology in Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome patients defective in RNaseH 2.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the mitotic and meiotic properties of telomeric regions in various laboratory strains of yeast. Using a sequence (Y probe) derived from a cloned yeast telomere (J. Szostak and E. Blackburn, Cell 29 : 245 - 255, 1982), we found that various strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae show extensive polymorphisms of restriction endonuclease fragment length. Some {{of the variation in}} the lengths of telomeric fragments appears to be under the control of a small number of genes. When DNA from various strains was digested with endonuclease KpnI, nearly all of the fragments homologous to the Y probe were found to be of different size. The pattern of fragments in different strains was extremely variable, with a greater degree of polymorphism than that observed for fragments containing the mobile TY 1 element. Tetrad analysis of haploid meiotic segregants from diploids heterozygous for many different Y-homologous KpnI fragments revealed that most of them exhibited Mendelian (2 : 0) segregation. However, only a small proportion of these fragments displayed the obligate 2 : 2 parental segregation expected of simple allelic variants at the same chromosome end. From the segregations of these fragments, we concluded that some yeast telomeres lack a Y-homologous sequence and that the chromosome arms containing a Y-homologous sequence are different among various yeast strains. Regions near yeast telomeres frequently undergo rearrangement. Among eight tetrads from three different diploids, we have found three novel Y-homologous restriction fragments that appear to have arisen during meiosis. In all three cases, the appearance of a new fragment was accompanied by the loss of another band. In one of these cases, the rearrangement leading to a novel fragment arose in an isogenic diploid, in which both homologous chromosomes should have been identical.

30|$|Future {{trials of}} gene therapy are {{strengthened}} {{by the fact that}} some FA patients are mosaic where a subgroup of cells is negative for DEB/MMC test while others are positive. Somatic mosaicism occurs due to the reversion of a pathogenic allele to 'wild' type in a single somatic cell and leads to the generation of normal functional allele, resulting in the growth/survival advantage of the corrected cell in the background of FA cells. The clinical implications of revertant mosaicism depend on the developmental stage, blood cell lineage affected by the reversion event and the clinical situation of the mosaic patient (Hoehn et al. 2007). In self renewing tissues, the reversion event may convey a growth advantage to the revertant cells leading to the ultimate replacement of the defective cells.

40|$|Double-strand break (DSB) induced gene {{conversion}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during meiosis and MAT switching is mediated primarily by mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA).

Palindromic insertions included in hDNA are expected to produce a stem-loop mismatch, escape repair, and segregate to produce a sectored (Ura+/-) colony. If conversion occurs by gap repair, the insertion should be removed on both strands, and converted colonies will not be sectored. For both a 14 -bp palindrome, and a 37 -bp near-palindrome, approximately 75 % of recombinant colonies were sectored, indicating that most DSB-induced <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> involves mismatch repair of hDNA. We also investigated mismatch repair of well-repaired markers flanking an unrepaired palindrome. As seen in previous studies, these additional markers increased loop repair (likely reflecting corepair).

To distinguish among these mechanisms, 16 spontaneous a/a and α/α derivatives were cloned from four natural a/α strains, P 37037, P 37039, P 75063, and P 34048, grown on nutrient agar.

The results demonstrate that while mitotic recombination was the mechanism for homozygosis in one offspring, loss of one chromosome 5 homolog followed by duplication of the retained homolog was the mechanism in the remaining 15 offspring, indicating that the latter mechanism is the most common in the spontaneous generation of MTL homozygotes in natural strains of C. albicans in culture...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{little is}} known about the nature of recombination-prone regions of the genome. Previously, we reported that the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) μ locus behaved as a hotspot for <b>mitotic,</b> intrachromosomal <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> (GC) between repeated μ constant (Cμ) regions in mouse hybridoma cells. To investigate whether elements within the μ gene regulatory region were required for hotspot activity, gene targeting was used to delete a 9. 1 kb segment encompassing the μ gene promoter (Pμ), enhancer (Eμ) and switch region (Sμ) from the locus. In these cell lines, GC between the Cμ repeats was significantly reduced, indicating that this ‘recombination-enhancing sequence’ (RES) is necessary for GC hotspot activity at the IgH locus. Importantly, the RES fragment stimulated GC when appended to the same Cμ repeats integrated at ectopic genomic sites. We also show that deletion of Eμ and flanking matrix attachment regions (MARs) from the RES abolishes GC hotspot activity at the IgH locus. However, no stimulation of ectopic GC was observed with the Eμ/MARs fragment alone. Finally, we provide evidence that no correlation exists between the level of transcription and GC promoted by the RES.

The system consists of two S. cerevisiae strains. In the haploid strain HAN alpha ura 3 (disrupted) trp 1 (disrupted) ADE 2 ::URA 3 ::kanMX 4 the URA 3 gene and the kanMX 4 cassette were inserted on chromosome XV distal to the ADE 2 locus.

The TRP 1 gene is inserted into the PHO 80 locus, which is next to the centromere on the other arm of the homologue of chromosome XV. The two strains were designed by series of targeted mutations and by fusion of the protoplasts. The genotype was verified by molecular-genetic methods. The use of the antibiotic resistance and the counterselective markers URA 3 -ura 3 and TRP 1 -trp 1 makes the direct quantitative registration of different genetic events possible. With the help of the URA 3 gene in the strain HAN forward mutations can be detected. The close coupling of the URA 3 gene with the ADE 2 locus and the kanMX 4 cassette makes it possible to detect beside point mutations also more spacious sequence changes such as deletion, insertion or inversion. In the diploid strain DAN the determination {{of the total number of}} uracil auxotrophs allows the simultaneous registration of mutations, <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversions,</b> crossing over events as well as chromosome losses. The frequency of mitotic recombination events is determined by the calculation of the difference between this total number and the mutation frequency in the strain HAN. The selection of tryptophan auxotrophes supplements the assessment of the chromosome losses. The close coupling between the ADE 2, URA 3, and kanMX 4 loci in the strain DAN allows a phenotypic differentiation of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> according to their length, between short (SGCs), medium (MGCs) and long (LGCs) events. The homocygoticity of the mating type it prevents the falsification of the results by meiotic recombination events. Using the strain system, the frequency of spontaneous mutations and recombination events was as had been expected. Deviations concerned the frequency of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> and crossing over events in the strain DAN. They occurred less frequently than in some other yeast test systems. A cause for this can be the homocygote configuration of the mating type alleles. Validating the test system with substances with well-known effect provided the expected results.

An effect caused by ethidiumbromide or benomyl could not be proven under the incubation conditions, which had been chosen. A weak mutagenic and recombinogenic effect of aniline was observed. The HAN/DAN system is a test system, with which mutagenic and recombinogenic influences can be recognized within few days. Beyond that the genetic events can be characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular-biological methods. Further advantages of the test system developed in this work are its easy handling and its reasonable price as well as the possibility to identify potential danger materials in a sensitive way...|$|R

40|$|Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) is a fully {{fluorinated}} eight-carbon {{fatty acid}} analog with exceptional stability toward degradation {{that has been}} used as an industrial surfactant and has been detected in environmental and biological matrices. Exposures to PFOA in the workplace and in the environment have continuously stimulated investigations into its potential human health hazards. In this article, the results of fifteen unpublished genotoxicity assays conducted with perfluorooctanoate (as either the linear or linear/branched ammonium salt (APFO) or the linear/branched sodium salt) are reported and include: seven mutation assays (three in vitro reverse mutation assays with histidine auxotrophic strains of Salmonella typhimurium, two in vitro reverse mutation assays with the tryptophan auxotrophic Escherichia coli WP 2 uvr strain, one in vitro <b>mitotic</b> recombination (<b>gene</b> <b>conversion)</b> assay with Saccharomyces cerevisiae D 4, and an in vitro Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) HGPRT forward mutation assay); seven studies to assess potential for chromosomal damage (three in vitro CHO chromosomal aberration studies, an in vitro human whole blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberration study, and three in vivo mouse micronucleus assays); and an in vitro C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cell transformation assay. Although PFOA has not been demonstrated to be metabolized, all in vitro assays were conducted both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} a mammalian hepatic microsomal activation system. These assays were originally described in twelve contract laboratory reports which have been available via the United States Environmental Protection Agency public docket (Administrative Record 226) for over a decade; however, the details of these assays have not been published previously in the open scientific literature. With the exception of limited positive findings at high and cytotoxic concentrations in some assay trials which reflected the likely consequence of cytotoxic disruption of normal cellular processes and not a specific genotoxic effect, the results of the studies presented in this paper and other published results clearly demonstrate the absence of direct mutagenic or genotoxic risk associated with PFOA. This finding is consistent with the physical/chemical characteristics of PFOA and is supported by other published genotoxicity studies...|$|R

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} facioscapulohumeral {{muscular dystrophy}} (FSHD 1 A) {{is associated with}} contractions of the polymorphic D 4 Z 4 repeat on chromosome 4 qter. Almost half of new FSHD mutations occur postfertilization, resulting in somatic mosaicism for D 4 Z 4. Detailed D 4 Z 4 analysis of 11 mosaic individuals with FSHD revealed a mosaic mixture of a contracted FSHD-sized allele and the unchanged ancestral allele in 8 cases, which is suggestive of a <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> without crossover. However, in 3 cases, the D 4 Z 4 rearrangement resulted in two different-sized D 4 Z 4 repeats, indicative of a gene conversion with crossover. In all cases, DNA markers proximal and distal to D 4 Z 4 showed no allelic exchanges, suggesting that all rearrangements were intrachromosomal. We propose that D 4 Z 4 rearrangements occur via a synthesis-dependent strand annealing model that relatively frequently allows for crossovers. Furthermore, the distribution of different cell populations in mosaic patients with FSHD suggests that mosaicism here results from D 4 Z 4 rearrangements occurring {{during the first few}} zygotic cell divisions after fertilization...|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the consequences of long-term asexual reproduction for sequence evolution in diploid or polyploid eukaryotic organisms. Some elementary theory shows that the amount of neutral sequence divergence between two alleles of a protein-coding gene in an asexual individual will be greater than that in a sexual species by a factor of 2 tu, where t is the number of generations since sexual reproduction was lost and u is the mutation rate per generation in the asexual lineage. Phylogenetic trees based on only one allele from each of two or more species will show incorrect divergence times and, more often than not, incorrect topologies. This allele sequence divergence can be stopped temporarily by <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion,</b> mitotic crossing-over, or ploidy reduction. If these convergence events are rare, ancient asexual lineages can be recognized by their high allele sequence divergence. At intermediate frequencies of convergence events, it will be impossible to reconstruct the correct phylogeny of an asexual clade from the sequences of protein coding genes. Convergence may be limited by allele sequence divergence and heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements which reduce the homology needed for recombination and result in aneuploidy after crossing-over or ploidy cycles...|$|E
40|$|Microbial populations {{depend on}} genetic {{variation}} {{to respond to}} novel environmental challenges. Plant pathogens are notorious {{for their ability to}} overcome pesticides and host resistance genes as a result of genetic changes. We report here that in particular hybrid strains of Phytophthora sojae, an oomycete pathogen of soybean, high frequency <b>mitotic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> rapidly converts heterozygous loci to homozygosity, resulting in heterokaryons containing highly diverse populations of diploid nuclei. In hybrids involving strain P 7076, conversion rates of up to 3 × 10 − 2 per locus per nucleus per generation were observed. In other hybrids, rates were of the order of 5 × 10 − 5. Independent gene conversion was observed within a selected linkage group including loci as close as 0. 7 kb apart and in unlinked markers throughout the genome. Gene conversions continued throughout vegetative growth and were stimulated by further sexual reproduction. At many loci, conversion showed extreme disparity, with one allele always being lost, suggesting that conversion was initiated by allele-specific double-stranded breaks. Pedigree analysis indicated that individual loci undergo multiple independent conversions within the nuclei of a vegetative clone and that conversion may be preceded by a heritable “activation” state...|$|E
