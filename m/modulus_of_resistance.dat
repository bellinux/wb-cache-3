40|$|The {{problem of}} {{proportioning}} an assembled steel I-beam made of three sheets is well-known. It {{is included in}} nearly every course of study where the analysis of steel components is involved. In the presented case we consider finding the depth of a beam with a predefined <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> based {{on the condition that}} the cross sectional area should be minimum. Such a depth of the beam is generally called optimum. At the same time, the minimum depth of the beam, which can be found from the stiffness conditions, can be considered in addition to its optimum depth. Such a problem is generally solved by empirical approaches with no strict formulation nor a proper mathematical analysis. The paper poses the problem as that of parametric mathematical programming with inequality constraints which appear as the condition of strength in bending, the condition of strength in shear, and the stiffness condition. Several variations which differ in the functional relationships between the depth of the beam’s web and its thickness have been analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Smart {{constructive}} {{system used}} for centuries {{in many places}} around the world, masonry is widely encountered in numerous heritage structures to be rehabilitated. For durability purposes, preservation operations that {{will be carried out}} on such structures require achieving a sufficient compatibility between parts that will be conserved and materials that will be brought through the rehabilitation process. Classically, incompatibility problems appear in relationship with the formulation of the mortars that will be used for repointing or repairing works. For setting up the compatibility problem, engineers usually focus on three axes: the mechanical one (<b>Modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Resistance</b> and/or Modulus of Elasticity), the physical one (gas and/or liquid transfer capabilities) and the perceptive one (colour and/or texture). In the daily practice, some practitioners typically insist on aesthetical aspects as they intend not to alter the perception of treated buildings. Replicating a satisfying texture is achieved by acting on sand granularities and finishing tools while the colour question usually requires manual trial and error procedures to be followed. Other practitioners privilege mechanical aspects for avoiding progressive damages induced by stress concentrations and target suitable values of MOR and MOE by relying on empirical recipes. Practically gathering both the approaches inside a same project is rare because it reveals difficult. The present paper describes an automatic computer-aided approach relying on evolutionary strategies (elitist genetic algorithm) in order to establish a mortar formulation encountering both aspects. The global framework in which the reflexion may take place, the optimization problem as well as the sharp manner to take each aspect into account are detailed. In its preliminary shape, the proposed tool focuses on the integration of strength and colour aspects but the method is designed to be extensible to complementary characteristics in a near future...|$|E

In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2 GPa; copper 137.8 GPa; and mild steel 160-169 GPa.

In the literature this problem solution is refereed as unreliable or solved with other more complex methods. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} calculate the surface potentials in a two. layer soil, for electrodes in the bottom layer, when images are at surface. The singularities in computing surface voltage, when the first image upwards lies at surface, are analysed and it's shown that a small change in top layer thickness allows an approximate solution. Surface potentials due to grid conductor are also considered and the values <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> are compared with those from other methodologies. Singularities for a ground rod that crosses the two layers are also treated.

The <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity, <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> rupture, decay <b>resistance</b> and field exposure were tested for in the samples and recorded before and after treatment for comparison in accordance to ASTM standards.

40|$|Carbon-containing {{refractory}} materials have received great attention {{over the last}} years due to their importance in the steelmaking process. The oxidation of carbon present in {{refractory materials}} at temperatures above 500 degrees C is usually accompanied by the decrease of their mechanical strength and chemical resistance. Aiming to improve the oxidation <b>resistance</b> <b>of</b> carbon-oxide refractories, the use of materials known as antioxidants has been extensively studied. In this work we evaluated the performance of MgB 2 and B 4 C antioxidants when incorporated into MgO-C bricks. We observed that the co-addition of metallic antioxidants and B 4 C or MgB 2 leads to refractory bricks with enhanced hot <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> rupture and <b>resistance</b> against oxidation and slag corrosion. However, the excessive addition of these antioxidants could impair the performance of the obtained bricks. Thus, when determining the optimum concentration of MgB 2 and B 4 C to be added into MgO-C refractories, one must take into consideration this behavior.

30|$|The rapid-hardening method {{employing}} the injection of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement mortar into voids between preplaced ballast aggregates has recently {{emerged as a}} promising approach for the renovation of existing ballasted railway tracks to concrete tracks. This method typically {{involves the use of}} a redispersible polymer powder to enhance the durability of the resulting recycled aggregate concrete. However, the effects of the amount of polymer on the mechanical and durability properties of recycled ballast aggregate concrete were not clearly understood. In addition, the effects of the cleanness condition of ballast aggregates were never examined. This study aimed at investigating these two aspects through compression and flexure tests, shrinkage tests, freezing–thawing resistance tests, and optical microscopy. The results revealed that an increase in the amount of polymer generally decreased the compressive strength at the curing age of 28  days. However, the use of a higher polymer ratio enhanced the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> rupture, freezing–thawing <b>resistance,</b> and shrinkage resistance, likely because it improved the microstructure of the interfacial transition zones between recycled ballast aggregates and injected mortar. In addition, a higher cleanness level of ballast aggregates generally improved the mechanical and durability qualities of concrete.|$|R

This modular is the cumulative <b>of</b> <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> subgrade reaction from plate load test (k) and additional <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> subgrade reaction due to pile installing (∆k). A recent method has used reduction <b>of</b> pile <b>resistance</b> approach in determining ∆k.
