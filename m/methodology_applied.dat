500|$|Although {{these three}} {{studies have been}} used by the federal {{government}} and other entities to understand the impact of the NAP program's benefits, the data used by the authors dates back to the periods between 1977 and 1984, providing limited relevant information for the current program of today. Additionally, subsequent research and analysis have revealed insufficiencies in the <b>methodology</b> <b>applied</b> by the authors of all three publications, thereby casting doubt on whether a definitive conclusion of the program's overall impact has been established. A 2004 report published by USDA's Economic Research Service evaluated the reliability and relevancy of these studies, concluding that they are not sufficient to determine the program's current impact and performance, and stating: ...|$|E

Under the guidance of Grose, the organization designed and developed a risk management methodology, known as SMART (Systems <b>Methodology</b> <b>Applied</b> to Risk Termination). The technique is a corporate budget system for addressing and mitigating legal, political, social, economic, and technological loss.

40|$|Large {{projects}} evaluation rises {{well known}} difficulties because -by definition- they modify the current price system; their public evaluation presents additional difficulties because they modify too existing shadow prices without the project.

New <b>methodologies</b> <b>applied</b> afterwards are based on variational inequalities, bilevel programming and linear or nonlinear complementarity. Their foundations and different applications related with project evaluation are explored. As a matter of fact, these new tools are closely related among them and can treat more complex cases involving -for example- the reaction of agents to policies or the existence of multiple agents in an environment characterized by common functions representing demands or constraints on polluting emissions...|$|R
