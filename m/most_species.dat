5|$|As {{is typical}} for surface dwelling, open water fish, <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are silvery, darker above and lighter below, {{an example of}} countershading. The tip of the lower jaw is bright red or orange in <b>most</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Discal Cell (dc) â€“ {{well defined}} in <b>most</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>most</b> common <b>species</b> in {{the spiral}} arm, {{we have several}} {{different}} empire/governments and communicate with <b>most</b> other <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|Explora {{aquarium}} houses nearly 4,000 {{organisms and}} 400 of Colombia's <b>most</b> common <b>species.</b> Its 25 tanks exhibit {{many of the}} <b>most</b> representative <b>species</b> that inhabit Colombia's rivers and oceans, including piranhas, electric eels, and a panchromatic kaleidoscope of fish.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> animal <b>species</b> are {{dioecious}} (gonochoric).|$|R
5|$|Head: Prognathous. Antennae are segmented. Biting-type mouthparts. Ocelli absent. Compound eyes in <b>most</b> <b>species,</b> {{reduced or}} absent in some taxa.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is an {{important}} sensory system for <b>most</b> <b>species</b> of fish. Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and their ears.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and <b>most</b> <b>species</b> have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. <b>Most</b> <b>species</b> release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Most</b> mycoplankton <b>species</b> {{are higher}} fungi.|$|R
50|$|White Cay iguanas {{are one of}} the <b>most</b> {{threatened}} <b>species</b> of all the West Indian rock iguanas and {{are described}} as critically endangered and a priority species according to the current IUCN Red List. It may be the <b>most</b> endangered <b>species</b> of lizard on earth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> {{mackerel}} <b>species</b> have restricted distribution ranges.|$|R
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>species</b> of beetles do not display {{parental care}} {{behaviors}} after the eggs have been laid.|$|E
5|$|Nematocysts inject venom into prey, {{and usually}} have barbs {{to keep them}} {{embedded}} in the victims. <b>Most</b> <b>species</b> have nematocysts.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanisms}} limit {{the success of}} hybridization, including the large genetic difference between <b>most</b> <b>species.</b> Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.|$|E
50|$|Cardiobacterium hominis. <b>Most</b> common <b>species</b> in the Cardiobacterium genus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> Oncidioid <b>species</b> have {{well-developed}} pseudobulbs and conduplicate leaves.|$|R
50|$|Kingella kingae. <b>Most</b> common <b>species</b> in the Kingella genus.|$|R
5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and swallows. <b>Most</b> <b>species</b> migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.|$|E
5|$|Adults of <b>most</b> <b>species</b> can {{regenerate}} tissues {{that are}} damaged or removed, although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning, splitting {{off from the}} edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; <b>most</b> <b>species</b> fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} organs include testicles and ovaries. In <b>most</b> <b>species,</b> gonads are paired organs of similar size, {{which can be}} partially or totally fused. There {{may also be a}} range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. <b>Most</b> <b>species</b> have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|Larger species often {{break up}} when stimulated, and the {{fragments}} often grow into full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. All reproduce sexually, and <b>most</b> <b>species</b> are gonochoric (the sexes are separate), {{but all the}} freshwater forms are hermaphroditic.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>most</b> <b>species</b> of parrots, Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} {{is protected}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>species</b> in {{this order}} lack pedicellariae and {{all have a}} {{delicate}} skeletal arrangement with small or no marginal plates on the disc and arms. They have numerous groups of short spines on the aboral surface. This group includes the red starfish Echinaster sepositus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>species</b> live in forests, {{although}} a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other arthropods form {{the most important part}} of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. <b>Most</b> <b>species</b> feed in the understory and midstory of the forest, {{although a}} few feed in the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following columns of army ants to eat the small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.|$|E
