5|$|Other {{projects}} {{include the}} realignment of Donelson Pike {{to the east}} and a <b>multi-modal</b> transit link to a future Nashville transit system. Construction began in 2017 on the new Parking and Transportation Center. To accommodate the immediate need for more international service, the existing international arrivals building is being upgraded on an interim basis while the permanent IAB is planned and constructed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales <b>Multi-Modal</b> Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's Crescent line connects Meridian {{with the}} cities of New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington, D.C.; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Union Station <b>Multi-Modal</b> Transportation Center (MMTC) is located at 1901 Front Street, part of the Meridian Downtown Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally built in 1906, but later {{demolished}} in 1966 then rebuilt in 1997, the station includes several modes of transportation including Amtrak, Norfolk Southern rail corridor, Greyhound buses, Trailways and other providers of transit services. The number of passengers on Amtrak trains, Greyhound buses, and Meridian Transit System buses averages 242,360 per year.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the metro}} started in 1984, when the Delhi Development Authority and the Urban Arts Commission {{came up with}} a {{proposal}} for developing a <b>multi-modal</b> transport system for the city. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was incorporated in May 1995, construction started in 1998, and the first section, on the Red Line, opened in 2002. The development of network was divided into phases, Phase I containing 3 lines was completed by 2006, and Phase II in 2011. Phase III is scheduled for completion by 2018 (originally planned for 2016).|$|E
5|$|The RTA, later renamed to Sound Transit, began {{planning}} the routing {{of the light}} rail line and placement of stations in 1998. Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle requested that the line be routed along International Boulevard to serve the airport's hotel area, while other officials {{from the city of}} SeaTac favored a station inside the current Sea-Tac Airport terminal to the west. Sound Transit selected their preferred route for the light rail line in 1999, choosing to serve the Port of Seattle's planned North End Airport Terminal, a <b>multi-modal</b> facility with a direct connection to the airport's Satellite Transit System, and a potential station at South 184th Street to serve the city center.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a mass rapid transit for New Delhi first emerged from a traffic and travel {{characteristics}} study which {{was carried out in}} the city in 1969. Over the next several years, many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology, route alignment, and governmental jurisdiction. In 1984,the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a <b>multi-modal</b> transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the city's existing suburban railway and road transport networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and {{effective}} colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a <b>multi-modal</b> signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government owned services such as light railways and buses, as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws. Bus services operate from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station in the city centre and carry over 130 million passengers daily across the entire network. Hyderabad's light rail transportation system, the <b>Multi-Modal</b> Transport System (MMTS), is a three line suburban rail service used by over 160,000 passengers daily. Complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by Setwin (Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities). Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad; the main, and largest, station is Secunderabad Railway Station, which serves as Indian Railways' South Central Railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad. Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are Hyderabad Deccan Station, Kacheguda Railway Station, Begumpet Railway Station, Malkajgiri Railway Station and Lingampally Railway Station. The Hyderabad Metro, a new rapid transit system, is {{to be added to}} the existing public transport infrastructure and is scheduled to operate by 2018.|$|E
25|$|South Bend International Airport {{is one of}} the few <b>multi-modal</b> {{transportation}} facilities in America that provide air, interstate bus and interstate rail service at one terminal. The St. Joseph County Airport Authority claims the airport was the first truly <b>multi-modal</b> airport in the country.|$|E

25|$|After the {{election}} of the Labour government in 1997, most remaining road schemes were cancelled and problem areas of the road network subject to <b>multi-modal</b> studies to investigate non-road alternatives, following the introduction of the A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England White Paper.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics and Freight Services {{carries out}} the {{enforcement}} of the Commission's rules. It has three divisions: Airports Division, Aviation Services, and Freight Services. The bureau, along with the Passenger Transportation Bureau, was formed out of the <b>Multi-Modal</b> Transportation Services Bureau in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Proposed {{as part of}} the SEMMMS (South East Manchester <b>Multi-Modal</b> Strategy) Relief Road Scheme, a {{new link}} road to the A6 south of Stockport has been approved.

25|$|There are daily {{flights of}} the Airbus Beluga {{transport}} aircraft of Airbus wings from Broughton {{for the smaller}} aircraft. The wings for the A380, which are too large to be transported by air, use a <b>multi-modal</b> transport using Flintshire's roads, the River Dee and the port of Mostyn, also in Flintshire.|$|E
25|$|Optimization {{problems}} are often multi-modal; that is, they possess multiple good solutions. They {{could all be}} globally good (same cost function value) or {{there could be a}} mix of globally good and locally good solutions. Obtaining all (or at least some of) the multiple solutions is the goal of a <b>multi-modal</b> optimizer.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{optimization}} techniques due {{to their}} iterative approach do not perform satisfactorily when {{they are used to}} obtain multiple solutions, since it is not guaranteed that different solutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm. Evolutionary algorithms, however, are a very popular approach to obtain multiple solutions in a <b>multi-modal</b> optimization task.|$|E
25|$|In July 1983, the Metropolitan Transit Authority {{was formed}} to {{integrate}} Melbourne's tram, train, and bus services. The Metropolitan Transit Authority also integrated bus, train, and tram ticketing using punch tickets and scratch tickets. Under the arrangements, the Government of Victoria collected all revenue {{from the sale of}} <b>multi-modal</b> tickets, which was then allocated to the various operators on the basis of an agreed formula.|$|E
25|$|Cohen {{announced}} in 2012 that Memphis {{is to be}} awarded a $15 million TIGER IV Grant for the Main Street to Main Street <b>Multi-Modal</b> Connector Project. The project will add a dedicated sidewalk to the Harahan Bridge connecting Tennessee to Arkansas, allowing people to walk, run, or bicycle over the Mississippi River. The project has drawn praise from many in the business community, including FedEx founder Fred Smith.|$|E
25|$|The public {{transport}} system is {{regulated by the}} Land Transport Authority, which oversees the three main modes of {{public transport}}ation. Fare regulation and bus service standards are under the purview of an independent body, the Public Transport Council, while TransitLink, established by SBS Transit, SMRT Trains and SMRT Buses, helps to create an integrated <b>multi-modal</b> system with a common fare-payment mode, information platform, and a physical network without duplication of services.|$|E
25|$|On September 25, 2010, UTA in {{partnership}} with Salt Lake City, the Utah Department of Transportation, the Wasatch Front Regional Council, and the Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Committee, opened a Bicycle Transit Center (BTC) at the Intermodal Hub. The BTC is anticipated to serve <b>multi-modal</b> commuters from TRAX and FrontRunner, {{as well as providing}} a secure bicycle parking space for bicycle tourists who want to tour the city on foot or transit.|$|E
25|$|From 1996, Melbourne's {{railway network}} used the <b>multi-modal</b> fare and {{ticketing}} system known as Metcard, which was valid on all public transport services in Melbourne. At {{the start of}} 2010 the new Myki smart-card ticketing system began to be introduced, which has replaced Metcard. By July 2012, Metcard was reduced to providing only short-term ticketing options, and on 29 December 2012 Metcard was no longer available for use on Melbourne's public transport.|$|E
25|$|Increasing the {{permeability}} of skin allows nanoparticles {{to penetrate}} and target cancer cells. Nanoparticles along with <b>multi-modal</b> imaging techniques {{have been used}} as a way to diagnose cancer non-invasively. Skin with high permeability allowed quantum dots with an antibody attached to the surface for active targeting to successfully penetrate and identify cancerous tumors in mice. Tumor targeting is beneficial because the particles can be excited using fluorescence microscopy and emit light energy and heat that will destroy cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|The reforms {{included}} {{the integration of}} bus, train, and tram tickets. From 1983 onwards, the State Government began collecting all revenue from the <b>multi-modal</b> tickets, with private bus operators receiving money for costs one month in advance. Unfortunately, the State Government had trouble increasing the fixed-ticket subsidies in line with inflation. The State Government would introduce a moratorium on new bus purchases, as well as make attempts at forcing the consolidation of the numbers of private bus operators, in attempt to overcome the subsidy problem.|$|E
25|$|SEPTA made {{strides in}} the 21st century that helped reverse the {{downward}} trend. $191 million of funds made {{available from the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were utilized to make over 30 major improvements to the system, including renovations of the Spring Garden and Girard Avenue subway stations and building the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) station at Fox Chase terminal in 2010. SEPTA also inaugurated a consolidated, <b>multi-modal</b> control center that helps manage all aspects of the system.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{controversy}} surrounding {{the future of}} Interstate 25 in northern Colorado (SH 7 in Broomfield to SH 14 in Fort Collins). Suggestions from adding toll lanes to general expansion to six lanes from the two lane bottleneck at SH 66 to SH 14 and adding <b>multi-modal</b> transportation options have been discussed. The future of the highway remains in question as funding is limited, and agreement is limited as well. The I-25 corridor in Weld and Larimer counties is becoming increasingly heavy with traffic, and something {{will have to be}} done soon.|$|E
25|$|The contest {{was billed}} as the 21st Century Race to the North, as a <b>multi-modal</b> version of past railway races from London to Scotland. The term Race to the North had emerged in the 1890s with the various railway {{companies}} {{on the east coast}} and west coast main lines competing for passengers. This culminated in the 1930s competition between the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) companies for the prestige of having the official fastest London to Scotland timetabled service, before the Second World War changed the priorities for the rail system.|$|E
25|$|The PMO of Narendra Modi {{overhauled}} the MEA {{in order}} to transform Indian diplomacy from a reactive bureaucracy to a proactive & entrepreneurial mind-set along the models of JETRO (Japan), KOTRA (South Korea) and TAITRA (Taiwan). Officers posted to Indian Missions overseas were ordered to act as force multipliers for the Indian economy by focusing on issues like identifying of market opportunities, foreign trade promotion & facilitation for Indian companies, overseas acquisition of energy supplies, securing raw-materials for domestic manufacturing industries and safeguarding <b>multi-modal</b> air-sea-land trading routes. In June 2015, the government announced that it intends to build capacity at the MEA through recruitment from academic circles and the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Meridian Main Street {{organized}} several {{projects to}} revitalize downtown {{and worked with}} merchants on marketing and design. It {{was one of the}} parties supporting the reconstruction of Union Station in 1997 based on the original design of the 1906 train station, with a contemporary use as a <b>multi-modal</b> transportation center for the region. Other Main Street projects included the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate the historic Grand Opera House in 2006, adapting it as the Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts. It is intended as a site of activities and events to enliven the city.|$|E
25|$|With traffic {{increasing}} due to {{a growing}} population, the city built Union Station in 1906 to coordinate all the railroads. Along with Union Station, several hotels were built, including Hotel Meridian, Grand Avenue Hotel, Terminal Hotel, and Union Hotel. By 1907 an average of 40 trains per day passed through the city, and the various railroad companies provided over 6,000 jobs to the city's residents. By 1920 as many as 100 trains per day passed through the station. The passenger station's central tower was demolished in the 1940s, and further demolition took place in 1966, but the city has since rebuilt the station in its original Mission Revival style. After its completion in 1996, the station was renamed the Meridian <b>Multi-Modal</b> Transportation Center.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Chabahar-Milak-Zaranj-Delaram {{route from}} Iran to Afghanistan is in progress. Iran is, with Indian aid, {{upgrading}} the Chabahar-Milak road and constructing a bridge {{on the route}} to Zaranj. India's BRO is laying the 213km Zaranj-Delaram road. It {{is a part of}} India's USD 750 million aid package to Afghanistan. The Chabahar port project is Iran's chance to end its US-sponsored economic isolation and benefit from the resurgent Indian economy. Along with Bandar Abbas, Chabahar is the Iranian entrepot on the North-South corridor. A strategic partnership between India, Iran and Russia is intended to establish a <b>multi-modal</b> transport link connecting Mumbai with St Petersburg, providing Europe and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia access to Asia and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The bus {{operators}} now funded {{their operations}} via a State Government subsidy, partially {{funded by the}} sale of <b>multi-modal</b> Met Tickets (rather than each bus company issuing their own tickets) which are {{commonly referred to as}} a 'Myki'. In another attempt to reduce costs beyond the 'go or grow' policy, the State Government refused to subsidise new capital investment into the private bus companies (for instance, spending on new depots) and put a moratorium on the subsidies on bus replacement. Any new additions to the fleets of bus companies would have to be covered out-of-pocket by the bus companies themselves. This policy led to the dilapidation of the bus fleet through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, though would later be lifted.|$|E
25|$|On 14 December 2010, the NCR Planning Board, Meerut Development Authority (MDA) and Meerut Nagar Nigam {{approved}} this system. In August 2011, it {{was reported}} that the project tender had been awarded to Delhi Integrated <b>Multi-Modal</b> Transit System (DIMTS). The proposed system was to have dedicated trains between Anand Vihar and Meerut, which stop nowhere in between, and trains which stop at stations to be constructed after a gap of 4–5km. The reported stations were Anand Vihar, Vaishali, Mohan Nagar, Meerut Road (Airtel Cut) Morta, Duhai, Muradnagar, Gang Nahar, Modi Nagar, Mohiuddinpur, Meerut Bypass Cut and Pallavpuram with completion expected in 2017. The track between Anand Vihar to Dabur was proposed to be underground {{with the rest of the}} track overhead.|$|E
