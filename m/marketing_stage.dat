50|$|The Base Ball Card Game, a {{prototype}} from 1904, is a noteworthy precursor to CCGs {{because it had}} some similar qualities but it never saw production to qualify it as a collectible card game. It is not known if the game {{was intended to be}} a standalone product or something altogether different like Top Trumps. The game consisted of a limited 112 cards and never saw manufacture past the <b>marketing</b> <b>stage.</b> In 1951, Topps released the Baseball Card Game that resembled CCGs because the game cards were sold in random packs and were collectible, however the game required no strategic play to operate. To play the game, players used a randomized deck to migrate their characters around a baseball diamond. Interaction between the two players was limited to who scored the most points and was otherwise a solitaire-like function since players could not play simultaneously but in tandem. This game seemed to be a followup of a game from 1947 called Batter Up by Ed-u-Cards Corp. The game was not sold in random packs but instead the entirety of the game could be obtained with one purchase. It utilized the same baseball diamond rules that Topps adopted in 1951. Other notable entries that resemble and predate the CCG are Strat-O-Matic, Nuclear War, BattleCards, and Illuminati. When designing Magic: The Gathering, Garfield borrowed elements from the board game Cosmic Encounter which also used cards for game play.|$|E

Lorne Lanning [...] The industry had become so risk-averse, that publishers were not willing to invest large amounts of money on projects that are not proven long-term successes. Under these conditions, Lanning found he could no longer continue in the video game industry, because he had bigger plans for the Oddworld brand. When he and McKenna first created Oddworld Inhabitants, they described themselves as a property development company, not a technology company. During the <b>marketing</b> <b>stage</b> of Munch's Oddysee, Lanning explained that Oddworld Inhabitants always looked at video games as [...] "the place to birth the property of Oddworld," [...] but the games were written in treatment form as though they're motion pictures because [...] "part of our dream is to make one of the big movies." [...] While the first step involved a video game development studio building technology that would run their critically and commercially successful games, it was not their ultimate goal. The success of their first game became the company's undoing, as their publisher demanded a quick follow-up, and they were eventually bogged down in game development, leaving them hamstrung when it came to achieving the company's next goal. So to reach that goal, the next phase of the studio's development began with focusing on the core of why they started the studio back in 1994: ...|$|E
40|$|Interviews with {{marketing}} {{executives and}} a literature review show that marketing re-search lacks a conceptualization and operationalization of market orientation (MO) that {{is appropriate for}} B 2 B markets. This study advances the understanding of “the market” and of MO from the supplier’s point of view along the value chain extending it to the subsequent <b>market</b> <b>stages</b> and third parties involved. We develop and empir-ically validate a conceptualization and operationalization of MO that fits B 2 B mar-kets. Our scale is based on NARVER/SLATER’s (1990) MKTOR-scale while sub-stantially extending it. The scale takes the importance of derived demand (down-stream <b>market</b> <b>stages)</b> and demand influencers (third parties) into account when measuring MO in a B 2 B context. The MO construct was operationalized {{on the basis of}} the MKTOR model with its three original dimensions of customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination as well as third party orienta-tion and <b>market</b> <b>stage</b> orientation as a first order reflective and second order forma-tive measurement model. Our results are based on n = 384 data sets and support the theory that all dimensions of MO contribute significantly to and represent independ-ent components of MO. In sum, the dimensions capture aspects of MO characteristic of B 2 B markets. By using a MIMIC model for validation purposes we show that the conceptualized model is capable of explaining 71 % of the variance of a firm’s MO. Relating to the theoretical frameworks of the Resourced-Based View, the Compe-tence-Based View and the Relational View, we develop a structural equation model and hypothesize that MO positively influences multi-stage marketing, i. e. aiming one’s marketing activities beyond the <b>market</b> <b>stage</b> of a company’s immediate cus-tomers, MO positively influences business collaborations, i. e collaborating with one’s direct customers in order to jointly develop products for subsequent <b>market</b> <b>stages,</b> and MO positively influences a firm’s innovativeness, i. e. being open to and testing new approaches to product and process innovations.

40|$|The distant {{marketing}} of vegetables {{has been developed}} in many places of the country because of the price differences among the regions. This research aims to explore the expansion process of the distant marketing developed at a village in Bangladesh. The historical data collected through a field survey at Losmanpur village in Sherpur district is used for this study. The expansion of distant marketing is divided into 3 stages: the launching of distant <b>marketing</b> <b>stage</b> during 1983 and 1985, the adaptive distant <b>marketing</b> <b>stage</b> during 1986 and 1993 and the extensive distant <b>marketing</b> <b>stage</b> since 1994 thereafter. The market at the initial stage was limited to only one season in one market of Dhaka city that has been expanded for whole the year to many other markets of other cities, too. This research has identified the factors influencing {{for the expansion of}} the distant marketing. The vegetable business requires less capital because the traders collect vegetables mostly on credit from the farms. The success factor of the credit-sale is the trust between the farmers and traders. The development of rice millings in Sherpur district has an indirect effect on the expansion of vegetable marketing because the vegetable has been carried as the extra load of rice trucks. The price information was available from the traders or truck drivers coming back to the locality. The expansion of telephone since the early 1990 ’s and the mobile phone since the late 1990 ’s has facilitated for receiving the update market price. The relation among the traders was friendly at the early stage of marketing and subsequently become collusive and competitive for increasing the number of traders. The farmers of the study village have expanded vegetable farming from 66 ha to 194 ha during 1996 and 2004 because of the gradual increase of demand...|$|E

Namely, in a pure strategy subgame perfect equilibrium, some but not all firms may engage in advance production, whether the firms are a priori symmetric or not.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we relate the {{economics}} of labeling genetically modified (GM) products {{to the theory of}} grading and minimum quality standards. The model represents three stages in the supply chain (farm production, marketing handlers, and final users) and allows explicitly for the accidental co-mingling of non-GM products at the <b>marketing</b> <b>stage.</b> Regulation {{takes the form of a}} threshold level of purity for non-GM products. The paper also presents a novel demand specification for differentiated GM and non-GM products that is particularly useful in our stochastic framework. First, we find that if the threshold purity level for non-GM products is too strict, this necessarily leads to the disappearance of non-GM product from the market. Second, we show that some quality standard is in the interest of farmers as well. Indeed, we show that the standard that is optimal from the perspective of producers is actually stricter than what is optimal for consumers and for societal welfare. We conclude with comparative statics effects that illustrate the impact of the model’s parameters on market equilibrium and on the welfare- maximizing regulatory standard...|$|E
