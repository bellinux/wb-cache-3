500|$|The {{thesis of}} physicalism {{is that the}} mind {{is part of the}} {{material}} (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other <b>material</b> <b>thing</b> seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a <b>material</b> <b>thing.</b> The project of providing such an explanation {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "naturalization of the mental". Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.|$|R

25|$|After {{using these}} two {{arguments}} to dispel solipsism and skepticism, Descartes {{seems to have}} succeeded in defining reality as being in three parts: God (infinite), minds, and <b>material</b> <b>things</b> (both finite).

25|$|The first {{emanation}} is Nous (Divine Mind, Logos, Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically {{with the}} Demiurge in Plato's Timaeus. It {{is the first}} Will toward Good. From Nous proceeds the World Soul, which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with nature. From the world soul proceeds individual human souls, and finally, matter, at {{the lowest level of}} being and thus the least perfected level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of nous and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in <b>material</b> <b>things</b> and then in the Forms.|$|E
50|$|Madhva states {{there are}} five {{permutations}} of differences between Jiva (individual souls) and Ishvara (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one <b>material</b> <b>thing</b> and another <b>material</b> <b>thing.</b> The differences are both qualitative and quantitative. Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, {{to the state of}} moksha in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the second}} assertion, a self-reflective {{awareness}} (svasaṃvedana) exists; consciousness can {{be aware of}} objects of cognition. This position was later critiqued by Je Tsongkhapa as implying that a self-reflective awareness is separate from objects of cognition. Ju Mipham later qualified its meaning; cognition is self-aware, not a separate <b>material</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{conclusions}} to {{be drawn}} from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to <b>material</b> <b>things,</b> and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via Averroes, came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance, and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The sadhaka {{may also}} meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity {{are put in}} the corpse's mouth. The {{practitioner}} may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in his mind. He can also practice japa (repetition of a mantra or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a voice from the skies) which may try to tempt him with <b>material</b> <b>things.</b> He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use a mantra) or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may ask for more offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes.|$|E
500|$|The first {{influential}} philosopher {{to discuss}} this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he gave is known as Cartesian dualism. [...] Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans (the realm of thought), {{in contrast to the}} domain of <b>material</b> <b>things,</b> which he called res extensa (the realm of extension). [...] He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland.|$|E

500|$|... "Living in the Material World" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released as}} the title track to his 1973 solo album. In the song's lyrics, Harrison presents a contrast between the world of <b>material</b> <b>things</b> and his spiritual goals, and the conflicting themes are represented in the musical arrangement, via juxtaposing sections in the rock genre and an Indian music setting. Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation, and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith. The contrasts presented in [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] inspired both a photograph by Ken Marcus that appeared inside the album's gatefold cover, and designer Tom Wilkes's incorporation of Krishna-related symbolism elsewhere in the packaging.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{the album}} {{includes}} {{a series of}} humorous skits that involve West joining a fictional black fraternity, [...] "Broke Phi Broke," [...] whose members pride themselves in living a life without money or worldly possessions, despite the glaring disadvantages such a lifestyle brings. His character is eventually expelled from the fraternity after their leader discovers that not only has West been making beats for cash on the side but has also been breaking some of its rules, such as eating meals everyday, buying new clothes, and taking showers. According to music writer Mickey Hess, the skits serve to encapsulate, [...] "a contradiction {{at the core of}} contemporary American life: the need to belong, to fit in, with your fellow humans versus the Darwinistic mad grab at <b>material</b> <b>things,</b> success in the latter being the very definition of success in our culture." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{reproduced}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison wrote {{the lyrics to}} [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] on portions of a torn-up envelope, which was previously addressed to Terry Doran at Apple Corps in central London, its postmark dated 7 November 1971. The song contrasts the world of <b>material</b> <b>things</b> against spiritual concerns. The verses describing the material world are set to rock music, over what Harrison biographer Simon Leng terms [...] "George's favourite 'Get Back' rhythm". The two sections describing the spiritual world – serving as the song's middle eights – use a more gentle melody backed by Indian instrumentation and so recall Harrison's 1967 composition [...] "Within You Without You", in Leng's view. While admiring how other Harrison lyrics from this period [...] "resembled Vedic sutras", author Joshua Greene writes that in [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] he [...] "condensed a lengthy passage from the Bhagavad Gita into a dozen simple words".|$|E

The next she is well again and Fatboy makes it clear that he wants sex with Poppy, as it would be their first time together. Poppy decides {{to spend the rest of}} Christmas with her family, and while she is gone, Fatboy buys food and gifts, but gives them to a homeless man who tells him Christmas is about love, not <b>material</b> <b>things.</b> As Poppy is about to leave with her sister Tansy Meadow (Daisy Wood-Davis), Fatboy stops the car. He later tells her he wants to wait to have sex with her and says he loves her, and she says it back to him.|$|E
500|$|Lágrimas Cálidas was {{produced}} by Jose Gaviria and Andres Munera. It was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios and Big Dog Studios in Miami, New World Studios in Bogota and Promix Estudios in Medellin. The genre of the album is defined as Tropipop, because it mixes tropical genres such as vallenato and merengue with pop and Caribbean influences. The album opens with [...] "No Te Pido Flores" [...] ("I'm Not Requesting Flowers"), [...] where the predominant instruments are the accordion, guitar and caja vallenata. Lyrically, the song begins with the absence of her man, but then, in the chorus, transitions into a warning not {{to fall in love}} with <b>material</b> <b>things.</b> The second track, [...] "Lágrimas Cálidas" [...] ("Warm Tears"), is a vallenato-stylized pop ballad, expressing her suffering due to being abandoned by her lover. [...] "Te Arrepentiras" [...] ("You'll Regret"), is about a woman who surrendered completely to a man who did not appreciate her.|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have <b>material</b> <b>things</b> because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool." ...|$|E

5000|$|Anaximenes of Miletus ( [...] ; Ἀναξιμένης ὁ Μιλήσιος; c. 585 - c. 528 BCE) was an Ancient Greek Pre-Socratic philosopher {{active in}} the latter half of the 6th century BC.

5000|$|In Whitehead's view, {{there are}} a number of {{problems}} with this notion of [...] "irreducible brute matter." [...] First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change.

For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that [...] "all things flow." ...|$|R
