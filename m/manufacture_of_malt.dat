40|$|Malting is the {{germination}} {{of cereal}} grain in moisture air under controlled conditions, {{the primary objective}} being to promote the development of hydrolytic enzymes which are not present in the un-germinated grain. The malting process can be divided in to three physically distined operations, i. e. Steeping, Germination and drying. In general malt quality increased with steeping time (from 16 to 40 hrs). Malt diastatic power increased with steeping temperature (up to 30 °C). The malt beverages are the class of instant food that contains fine powders simply mixed with sugar and skim milk powder. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>malt</b> beverage powder involves the preparation of sorghum malt flour followed {{by the process of}} mashing and then drying.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>malt</b> {{and beer}} {{requires}} {{large amounts of}} electrical and thermal energy which is nowadays mainly based on fossil fuels. In State of the Art breweries 7. 5 – 11. 5 kWhel [1] and 16. 7 – 33. 3 kWhth [1, 2] per hl of beer are needed (reference: final energy demand) and the annual output of medium to large sized breweries may easily exceed one million hl. The entire process heat demand of the thermally driven processes in breweries and malting plants can be met with heat at a temperature of between 25 and 105 °C on process level [3, 4]. This enables the integration of solar thermal energy supplied by conventional, non- concentrating solar thermal collector technologies such as flat-plate or evacuated tube collectors. In fact, providing thermal energy by means of solar thermal systems is mostly energy efficient if the energy from the sun is converted into heat and supplied to the process at minimum required temperature level (referred to as solar integration on process level). With this regard and {{in the framework of}} a European Union-funded demonstration project, three large-scale solar thermal systems (each with an installed thermal peak capacity ≥ 1 MWth) are being realized. The focus of the project is to demonstrate the integration of large scale solar thermal systems on process level for different applications (mashing, pasteurization of beer, drying of green malt) at process temperatures below 80 °C. This script mainly focuses on technical solutions for the hydraulic integration of large solar process heat applications equipped with flat plate collectors for a direct heat supply to thermally driven processes in the brewing industry...|$|E

40|$|Malt (dried, sprouted cereal grain) is {{the major}} {{ingredient}} in most beers and in certain hot and cold beverages. It is also a useful ingredient in some cereal food products such as bread and infant porridges. In terms <b>of</b> nutrients, <b>malt</b> contains mainly complex carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber), but also protein of reasonable quality and availability, B vitamins and minerals. Malt {{is a source of}} hydrolytic enzymes, especially amylases. In brewing, the malt amylases produce the sugars which the yeast ferments to alcohol and carbon dioxide The amylases also increase the sweetness and improve the texture of food products such as bread and porridges.

5000|$|The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> whisky from <b>malted</b> grains in India was {{pioneered by}} Amrut Distilleries in 1982. Amrut Distilleries began {{procuring}} barley from farmers in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, {{in addition to}} molasses, and launched Prestige Blended Malt Whisky in the Canteen Stores Department in 1986. The first batch <b>of</b> single <b>malt</b> whisky was ready within 18 months. Because India had no culture <b>of</b> consuming single <b>malts</b> at the time, the company did not consider bottling it as a single malt. Instead, the whisky was blended with alcohol distilled from sugarcane to produce MaQintosh Premium Whisky. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, [...] "The alcoholic beverages industry was not a priority in the country. Although we received help {{to a certain extent}} from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), we had to find our own ways to learn about improved distilling methods". Amrut Distilleries launched Amrut, the first single malt whisky to be made in India, on 24 August 2004. The production <b>of</b> Amrut single <b>malt</b> whisky {{was the result of the}} distillery having malt that was ageing far in excess of what was needed for its medium range Prestige Malt Whisky. Initially, Amrut aged malt whisky for around a year before blending it. However, due to changing customer preferences, less malt whisky was being added into blended variants. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that because of climate differences, one year of barrel ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland.|$|R

40|$|The paracaspase MALT 1 has arginine-directed {{proteolytic}} activity {{triggered by}} engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 into activation complexes {{is required for}} MALT 1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 in HEK 293 cells, either with activated CARD 11 and BCL 10 or with TRAF 6, was used to explore the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 isoform A (MALT 1 A) at R 781 (R 770 in MALT 1 B) and revealed that TRAF 6 can activate <b>MALT</b> 1 independently <b>of</b> the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R 781 /R 770 removes a C-terminal TRAF 6 -binding site in both MALT 1 isoforms, leaving MALT 1 B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF 6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL 10. By using MALT 1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF 6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF 6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 and accelerates MALT 1 protein turnover. The MALT 1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R 149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K 644 residue, previously {{shown to be a}} site for mono-ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R 781 /R 770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R 149 and stabilized MALT 1 by hindering interaction with TRAF 6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on MALT 1 A but severely reduced MALT 1 B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved MALT 1 A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1.

During TCR- or BCR-induced NF-kB activation, MALT 1 serves to mediate the activation of the IKK (IkB kinase) complex, which subsequently regulates the activation of NF-kB. Aggregation <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 is important for E 3 ligase activation and NF-kB signaling. Principal Findings: Unlike the isolated CARD or paracaspase domains, which behave as monomers, the tandem Ig-like domains <b>of</b> <b>MALT</b> 1 exists as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in solution.
