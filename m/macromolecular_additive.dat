40|$|The {{discovery}} of an easy and powerful way to further improve and stabilize {{the performance of}} organic solar cells (OSCs) from the current levels would advance their commercialization. In this work, an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11. 6 % with improved stability is demonstrated by using a high-quality n-type <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) via a simple route without additional processing steps, where the high-quality P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) is isolated by a THF-soaking treatment. We attribute the improved performance to advantageous changes in the morphology of the photoactive materials induced by the <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive.</b> In addition, using the ITO-free architecture on a flexible PET substrate, we obtain an impressive PCE of 5. 66 % in macromolecular additive-processed devices. Due to its great applicability and easy accessibility, {{the use of the}} <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> introduced in this study has great potential for broad applications with other OSC systems, which will accelerate the commercial viability of photovoltaic technology. close...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{question}} of how <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> processing in recent years, sparsely used, affects structural organization and photovoltaic performance, various macromolecular additives (PS, PDMS, and PMMA) vis-&# 224;-vis small DIO additive are applied to a model bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system based on DTGe(FBTTh 2) 2. These additives have been shown to exhibit a strong influence on film morphology as a function of additives type, with significant changes in packing orientation, film roughness, and feature size observed, leading to improved power-conversion efficiency (PCE). Interestingly, an unexpectedly large increase in PCEs, from 6. 03 % to 7. 07 %, is demonstrated upon adding 1 % (w/w) PMMA to DTGe(FBTTh 2) 2 :PC 61 BM devices, possessing an even greater PCE than DIO. In addition, when 0. 2 % (v/v) DIO is added to DTGe(FBTTh 2) 2 :PC 71 BM, several key device metrics increase, producing the highest PCE of 7. 55 % for DTGe(FBTTh 2) 2 -based devices to date. In the present work, PMMA is confirmed to provide a highly effective means for controlling morphology and significantly enhancing PCEs. Not only do the results from this study will aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying the impact of <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> processing, but they will also be key in leading to future studies that will elucidate the driving forces behind and exact points of interaction of macromolecular additives. clos...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we employ a biomineral-inspired growth {{approach}} to the prototypical metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) ZIF- 8 and HKUST- 1 using cheap abundant non-toxic gelatin hydrogels as both a matrix and <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> for crystal growth. Both MOFs are readily prepared within the hydrogel, and while ZIF- 8 @gelatin composites are readily dispersed in water to form colloidal solutions stable for several months, the matrix has a significantly more pronounced effect on the crystal growth and morphology of HKUST- 1 directly mirroring natural matrix-mediated biomineralisation processes. Addition of small amounts of gelatin (< 1 wt%) to solvothermal syntheses of the frameworks indicates that the biomacromolecule can influence particle size, {{and in the case}} of HKUST- 1 leads to mesostructured aggregates of particles that can be tuned across multiple length scales...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{spheroid}} {{cultures have}} become increasingly popular as drug screening platforms, especially {{with the advent of}} different high throughput spheroid forming technologies. However, comparing drug efficacy across different cell types in spheroid culture can be difficult due to variations in spheroid morphologies and transport characteristics. Improving the reproducibility of compact, circular spheroids contributes to standardizing and increasing the fidelity of the desired gradient profiles in these drug screening three-dimensional tissue cultures. In this study we discuss the role that circularity and compaction has on spheroids, and demonstrate the impact methylcellulose (MethoCel) and collagen additives in the culture media can contribute to more compact and circular spheroid morphology. We demonstrate that improved spheroid formation is not a simple function of increased viscosity of the different macromolecule additives, suggesting that other macromolecular characteristics contribute to improved spheroid formation. Of the various <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additives</b> tested for hanging drop culture, MethoCel provided the most desirable spheroid formation. Additionally, the higher viscosity of MethoCel-containing media improved the ease of imaging of cellular spheroids within hanging drop cultures by reducing motion-induced image blur. open 2...|$|R
40|$|International audienceScFv {{antibody}} fragments are {{a promising}} alternative to full-length antibodies for both therapeutic and diagnosis applications. They can be overexpressed in bacteria, which enables easy large scale production. Since scFv are artificial constructs, they are poorly soluble {{and prone to}} aggregation, which makes them difficult to manipulate and to refold. Here, stabilization and refolding of scFv fragments from urea-unfolded solutions are reported based {{on the use of}} micromolar amounts of polymers playing the role of artificial chaperons. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, the size and aggregation number of complexes of scFv with unmodified or hydrophobically modified poly(sodium acrylate) are determined. The evolution of the secondary structure along the refolding procedure, in {{the presence or absence of}} 0. 4 m l-arginine at scFv:polymer < 1 : 5 (w/w), is determined by high-sensitivity synchrotron-radiation circular dichroism. Measurements reveal that refolding in the presence of polymers yields native-like secondary structure, though a different folding pathway can be followed compared to refolding in the absence of polymer. This is the first report on the use of <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additives</b> to assist refolding of a multidomain protein of therapeutic interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} novel, soft {{membrane}} structures with chemical and physical properties that are tunable {{across a broad}} spectrum of parameter space is important for the development of new functional materials. Many potential applications of these novel membranes will likely require biocompatible interfaces, e. g., for functional reconstitution of integral proteins. Here we investigate the formation and control of compositional heterogeneities in hybrid lipo-polymersomes (HLPs) created by mixing the diblock copolymer poly(butadiene-b-ethylene oxide) with common natural lipids, e. g., 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine or 1, 2 -palmitoyl-oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine. Mixing and de-mixing of lipid-rich domains from the polymer-rich matrix of hybrid vesicles is controlled via thermally driven phase separation and by the inclusion of cholesterol. Domain size and morphology can be controlled by cooling rate and lipid composition, respectively. <b>Macromolecular</b> <b>additives,</b> e. g., cyclodextrins, enzymes and surfactants, can be used to remodel the hybrid membrane and its domains, resulting in domain dissolution, controlled release of contents or rupture of the hybrid vesicles. These composite membranes are promising materials for encapsulation-based technologies that require the combination of biocompatible membrane environments and enhanced structural stability, e. g., delivery and sensing applications or controlling (bio) chemical reactions within confinement...|$|R
40|$|Polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) {{membranes}} {{were prepared}} by non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) method using different macromolecular additives, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(propylene oxide) -b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PluronicÂ®, Plu). Their effects on membrane structure and their {{stability in the}} polymer membrane matrix {{as well as the}} resulting membrane performance were systematically compared {{in order to determine the}} additive that should be preferred. The investigated membrane characteristics include surface hydrophilicity (by contact angle), surface charge (by zeta potential), surface chemistry (by FTIR spectroscopy), water flux and rejection of macromolecular test substances. Visualization of membrane surface and cross-section morphology was also done by scanning electron microscopy. The membrane performance was examined by investigation of adsorptive fouling and ultrafiltration using solution of bovine serum albumin as the model system. The stability of additive was examined by incubating the membrane in water (40 oC) and sodium hypochlorite solution. Modification effects on membrane characteristic as well as per-formance via blending membrane polymer and <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> were clearly observed. Overall, the results suggest that Pluronic showed the best behavior in all respects, and, consequently, it should be considered in practical applications...|$|E
40|$|Operational {{stability}} and high performance {{are the most}} critical issues {{that must be addressed}} in order to propel and advance the current polymer solar cell (PSC) technology to the next level, such as manufacturing and mass production. Herein, we report a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11. 2 %, together with an excellent device stability in PTB 7 -Th:PC 71 BM-based PSCs in the inverted structure by introducing the n-type P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) <b>macromolecular</b> <b>additive</b> (> 75 % PCE retention at high temperature up to 120 degrees C, > 97 % PCE retention after 6 months in inert conditions, > 93 % PCE retention after 2 months in air with encapsulation, and > 80 % PCE retention after 140 h in air without encapsulation). The PCE is the highest value ever reported in the single-junction systems based on the PTB 7 family and is also comparable to the previously reported highest PCE of inverted PSCs. These promising results are attributed to the efficient optimization and stabilization of the blend film morphology in the photoactive layer, achieved using the P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) additive. From the perspective of manufacturing, our studies demonstrate a promising pathway for fabricating low-cost PSCs with high efficiency as well as long-term stability...|$|E
