40|$|Mercury and polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) residues in livers of trapper harvested river otters (Lontra canadensis) from Massachusetts were evaluated. We collected 210 river otters during 1986 and 1987 and composited them into 103 samples based on location. Comparisons among 20 watersheds were made using 96 samples. Mercury residues were detected in all samples and ranged from 0. 45 to 4. 82 ppm wet weight with an arithmetic mean of 1. 93 ppm. PCB residues were detected {{in all but}} 2 samples and ranged from none-detected to 22. 00 ppm with a geometric mean of 1. 03 ppm wet weight. Differences were detected among watersheds for mercury (P = 0. 007) and PCBs (P = 0. 03). Juvenile otters had lower mercury (P = 0. 007) and PCB (P = 0. 02) residues than older otters. River otters can provide an indication of general watershed background <b>mercury</b> and PCB <b>contamination</b> levels for prioritizing more intensive monitoring efforts.

30|$|A clear link {{has been}} {{established}} between <b>mercury</b> (Hg) <b>contamination</b> in the Amazon region and gold mining activities due {{to the use of}} metallic Hg in the mining process (Veiga et al. 1999), however, in some cases, the link between Hg contamination (soil, sediment, fish or human) and gold mining is not always clear.

40|$|Abstract Background Mercury is a {{prominent}} environmental contaminant that causes detrimental effects to human health. Although the liver {{has been known}} to be a main target organ, there is limited information on in vivo molecular mechanism of mercury-induced toxicity in the liver. By using transcriptome analysis, phenotypic anchoring and validation of targeted gene expression in zebrafish, mercury-induced hepatotoxicity was investigated and a number of perturbed cellular processes were identified and compared with those captured in the in vitro human cell line studies. Results Hepato-transcriptome analysis of mercury-exposed zebrafish revealed that the earliest deregulated genes were associated with electron transport chain, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, nuclear receptor signaling and apoptotic pathway, followed by complement system and proteasome pathway, and thereafter DNA damage, hypoxia, Wnt signaling, fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, cell cycle and motility. Comparative meta-analysis of microarray data between zebrafish liver and human HepG 2 cells exposed to mercury identified some common toxicological effects of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity in both models. Histological analyses of liver from mercury-exposed fish revealed morphological changes of liver parenchyma, decreased nucleated cell count, increased lipid vesicles, glycogen and apoptotic bodies, thus providing phenotypic evidence for anchoring of the transcriptome analysis. Validation of targeted gene expression confirmed deregulated gene-pathways from enrichment analysis. Some of these genes responding to low concentrations of mercury may serve as toxicogenomic-based markers for detection and health risk assessment of environmental <b>mercury</b> <b>contaminations.</b> Conclusion Mercury-induced hepatotoxicity was triggered by oxidative stresses, intrinsic apoptotic pathway, deregulation of nuclear receptor and kinase activities including Gsk 3 that deregulates Wnt signaling pathway, gluconeogenesis, and adipogenesis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, endocrine disruption and metabolic disorders. This study provides important mechanistic insights into mercury-induced liver toxicity in a whole-animal physiology context, which will help in understanding the syndromes caused by mercury poisoning. The molecular conservation of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity between zebrafish and human cell line reveals the feasibility of using zebrafish to model molecular toxicity in human for toxicant risk assessments. </p...|$|R
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E
25|$|The Archeological-Mining of the Sierra Gorda Project {{was begun}} in the 1970s, based on an earlier {{interdisciplinary}} study carried out at the Sierra de Querétaro.

40|$|Background: The Cecina river valley, in Tuscany, is {{characterized}} by environmental chromium contamination; Cr(VI) concentrations in ground and surface waters exceeds the WHO limit for drinking water. Boron, arsenic, <b>mercury</b> <b>contaminations,</b> of natural or industrial origin, pesticides use, and waste landfilling are causes of community concern. Objective: To investigate health status of population residing in the polluted area. Methods: A large environmental database was built collecting soil and drinkable water data from public and private sources. Cancer and non-cancer causes of mortality, hospitalization and malformation groups of residents in municipalities {{included in the study}} area over 1980 - 2006 were considered. Standardized Mortality/Hospitalization Ratios (SMR/SHR) and Bayesian Mortality/Hospitalization Ratios (BMR/BHR) were calculated. Cluster analysis using the Spatial Scan Statistics was performed. To understand knowledge, awareness and risk perception a qualitative survey through interviews was carried out among local administrators, public sector technical personnel and NGOs representatives. Results: Statistically significant mortality excesses resulted for circulatory diseases in men (Obs= 1788, SMR= 1. 06) and women (Obs= 2111, SMR= 1. 10), colon cancer in women (Obs= 44, SMR= 1. 38), stomach cancer in men (Obs= 42, SMR= 1. 43). Statistically significant hospitalization excesses resulted for respiratory diseases in men (Obs= 585, SHR= 1. 15), chronic respiratory diseases in women (Obs= 88, SHR= 1. 71), digestive diseases in men (Obs= 766, SHR= 1. 13) and women (Obs= 565, SHR= 1. 13), lynphohematopoietic diseases in women (Obs= 217, SHR= 1. 15). Clustering analysis and BMRs/BHRs confirmed the evidence from SMRs/SHRs. Other mortality/hospitalization excesses for specific cancers were observed in some subareas. The awareness of environmental problems was found to be high in the area, with significant differences in deliveries/consequences: NGOs, with a low level of confidence towards public bodies, were critical about future management. Relationship with media was generally good, indicating a positive attitude from the public. Conclusions: The results are useful to plan advanced environmental and epidemiological studies, to open dialogue with local representatives, to promote future remediation activities and to enforce recommendations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interactions between}} snowpack chemistry, <b>mercury</b> (Hg) <b>contamination</b> and microbial community structure and function in Arctic snow. Snowpack chemistry (inorganic and organic ions) including mercury (Hg) speciation was studied in samples collected during a two-month field study in a high Arctic site, Svalbard, Norway (79 °N). Shifts in microbial community structure were determined by using a 16 S rRNA gene phylogenetic microarray. We linked snowpack and meltwater chemistry to changes in microbial community structure by using co-inertia analyses (CIA) and explored changes in community function due to Hg contamination by q-PCR quantification of Hg-resistance genes in metagenomic samples. Based on the CIA, chemical and microbial data were linked (p = 0. 006) with bioavailable Hg (BioHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) contributing significantly to the ordination of samples.

25|$|Las Ranas and Toluquilla {{were the}} two largest prehispanic cities to develop in the Sierra Gorda area. Las Ranas was the most {{developed}} city from the 7th to the 11th century, with Toluquilla somewhat smaller and reaching its height in the 11th century. Both cities are near {{to each other and}} both controlled the active trade routes of the area as well as the mining of cinnabar, highly prized as a red pigment in Mesoamerica. The trade that passed through the area linked the Gulf of Mexico to the central Mexican Plateau and some areas north as well. Extensive mining was done at both Toluquilla and Las Ranas beginning between 200 and 300 CE, extracting cinnabar, mercury and sulfur. Cinnabar was the most prized used in funerals. The structures at the sites indicate a stratified society and built with stone slabs and mud and covered in stucco in some places. At Toluquilla, many structures were built on terraces cut into the mountain to create more space. Las Ranas was taken over by the Chichimeca Jonaz late in its history {{but by the time the}} Spanish arrived, both cities were abandoned. In 2009, INAH and other institutions carried out research at Toluquilla on thirty skeletons from the pre Hispanic era in order to determine the importance of mining in the south of the Sierra Gorda.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of research on <b>mercury</b> (Hg) <b>contamination</b> in Malaysia and its evolution from 1979 to 2012. The objective of this paper was to review and provide an understanding of Hg exposures in the environment, humans, and food in Malaysia. Hg concentration in the environment is high in areas of West Port, Malacca Straits, Prai, and Johor because these areas receive anthropogenic metal loads brought about by industrial activities. Hg concentration in humans is related to seafood intake (dietary), environmental conditions, and different geographical locations. Hg levels in food showed higher concentration in the West coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Hg concentration is also present in the country's tropical fruits, which is related to agrochemical and fertilizer usage.
