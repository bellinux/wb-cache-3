I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

40|$|According to Railton: x is good forme iff my Fully Informed Self (FIS) while contemplating my {{situation}} would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> x. I offer four interpretations of this view. The first three are inadequate. Their inadequacy {{rests on the}} following two facts: (a) my FIS cannot <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> what would be irrational for <b>me</b> to <b>want,</b> (b) when contemplating what is rational for <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> we must specify a particular way in which I could rationally acquire the recommended desire. As a result, what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> is limited by what information my FIS could reliably convey to me. And therefore what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> cannot be grounded in changes in desires that my FIS cannot publicly justify. The fourth interpretation limits the scope of what my FIS could <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> {{in a way that}} avoids these problems, but conflicts with standard intuitions about what is a non-moral good...|$|R

500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E

500|$|Elections {{director}} Alexander Payne {{was eager}} to cast Witherspoon as Tracy, based on her performances in Freeway and the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, and Witherspoon was equally eager {{to sign on to}} the project—but not to play Tracy. Witherspoon was drawn to the part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's dark horse presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, [...] "That speech alone made <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to play Tammy!

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball.
