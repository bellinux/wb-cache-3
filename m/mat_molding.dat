40|$|Recent {{developments}} in carbon phenolic ablatives for solid rocket motor nozzles have yielded a pitch precursor carbon fiber offering significant raw material availability and cost saving advantages {{as compared to}} conventional rayon precursor material. This paper discusses {{the results of an}} experimental program conducted to assess the thermal performance and characterize the thermal properties of pitch precursor carbon phenolic ablatives. The end result of this program is the complete thermal characterization of pitch fabric, pitch mat, hybrid pitch/rayon fabric and pitch <b>mat</b> <b>molding</b> compound. With these properties determined an analytic capability now exists for predicting the thermal performance of these materials in rocket nozzle liner applications. Further planned efforts to verify material performance and analytical prediction procedures through actual rocket motor firings are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{majority}} of polyurethanes are crosslinked thermoset polymers, which cannot be recycled by melting and extrusion processes without excessive degradation. Sev-eral recycling techniques for polyurethanes {{have been described}} in technical and scientific literature and are used industrially, such as rebonding of flexible foam, regrind and hot stamping of Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding (RRIM) and glycolysis of rigid foams. Several chemical recycling methods for polyurethanes have been developed and pa-tented, such as hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis and acidolysis. The glycolysis process is also being used on an industrial scale for recycling of "in house " production waste of rigid and microcellular shoe sole, polyurethane foam. This article describes a novel, new, chemical recycling process that has been developed to produce relatively high performance polyols from the recycling of a diversity of polyurethanes. This process is attractive for use on an industrial scale {{and appears to be}} commercially viable, based on cost-performance, particularly {{in the context of the}} total eco-balance of polyurethanes. Consequently, further development work and innovation, based upon this research, should be a high priority for the global polyurethanes industry to recycle "in house " and "post consumer " polyurethane waste. Molded MDI-based automotive seating foam has been converted into polyols, which can be used in prime automotive applications, such as low-density <b>mat</b> <b>molding</b> and sound in-sulation. TDI-based flexible slabstock foam and RRIM materials have been efficiently converted in to relatively high performance polyols by this new chemical recycling pro-cess...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely known {{composite}} manufacturing techniques of the liquid molding family, being extensively studied and used to obtain advanced composite materials comprised of fibers embedded in a thermoset polymer matrix. Nowadays, RTM is used by many industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, civil and sporting equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study is to verify the effect of calcium carbonate mixed in resin in the RTM process. Several rectilinear infiltration experiments were conducted using glass fiber <b>mat</b> <b>molded</b> in a RTM system with cavity dimensions of 320 x 150 x 3. 6 mm, room temperature, maximum injection pressure 0. 202 bar and different content of CaCO 3 (10 and 40 %) with particle size of 75 µm. The results show that the use of filled resin with CaCO 3 influences the preform impregnation during the RTM molding, changing the filling time and flow from position, however it is possible to make the composite with a good quality and low cost...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The non-isothermal flow-field of a mold {{filling process}} in resin {{injection}} molding with preplaced fiber mats is numerically simulated {{in the present}} article. A body-fitted coordinate transformation is applied such that the irregular, moving flow front can be fitted exactly as a boundary, and the error induced from the treatment of boundary con-ditions is thus reduced. The effects of several parameters, such as types of <b>mats,</b> porosity, <b>mold</b> wall temperature and flow rate of resin at the inlet, on the filling process is deeply investigated. KEY WORDS: resin transfer molding (RTM), structure reaction injection molding (SRIM), flow in porous media...|$|R
50|$|In White’s day, the {{newspaper}} was printed by the hot lead method. Type {{was set on}} a linotype using molten lead or by hand from cases full of individual letters. Illustrations for ads were poured using <b>mats</b> as <b>molds.</b> This continued for over fifty years, {{with the addition of}} an engraver for photographs, until Dick David bought electronic type-setting equipment that allowed {{the newspaper}} to be printed by the offset method. The equipment was updated, and a darkroom installed, carrying the newspaper into the 1980s when the Ajo Copper News finally entered the era of typesetting on computers. Some of the old type cases and a proof press can be seen at the Ajo Historical Society Museum.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of two Sternorrhyncha species, the banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Aphidinae)), vector of the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), and the latania scale (Hemiberlesia lataniae Signoret (Hemiptera: Diaspididae, Diaspidinae)) with Musa acuminata balbisiana Colla (ABB Group) ‘Bluggoe’ (Musaceae) was investigated {{by a combination}} of conventional and spatially resolved analytical techniques, 1 H NMR, UHPLC-MS, and matrix-free UV-laser desorption/ionization MS imaging. After infestation, the feeding sites of P. nigronervosa on the pseudostem and the exocarp of banana fruit developed a red tinge, in which tissue-specific accumulations of phenylphenalenones were discovered. Phenylphenalenones were also detected in the black <b>mats</b> of sooty <b>molds</b> growing on the banana aphid exudates and in the dorsal scales of H. lataniae. This suggests that although these secondary metabolites {{play a role in the}} reaction of banana plants towards attack by sucking insects, an aphid and an armored scale have established mechanisms to exude these metabolites before they deploy their deleterious effect...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on kenaf-polypropylene composites manufactured from preformed mats consisting of kenaf and polypropylene fibers in a ratio of 1 : 1 in weight to explore the prospects of annual natural plant fibers as reinforcements for polymer-matrix composites. Surface treatments to the comingled kenaf-polypropylene fiber mats were first carried out using different coupling agents to increase the compatibility of the natural fiber and the polypropylene matrix. Kenaf-polypropylene composite laminates were fabricated from the <b>mats</b> via compression <b>molding.</b> Experimental results indicated that, among the coupling agents chosen, maleated polypropylene was the most effective coupling agent to significantly improve the mechanical performance of the composites. Analyses using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and scanning electron microscopy revealed that maleated polypropylene was able to promote strong adhesion between the kenaf fibers and the polypropylene matrix at their interfaces. The outcomes of the study indicate {{that the use of}} the preformed fiber mats in combination with fiber surface modifications makes it possible to efficiently produce natural fiber reinforced composites with excellent mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) micron and nano sized-particles with {{different}} morphologies were synthesized by aqueous precipitation and evaluated as antimicrobial agents against foodborne pathogens. The most effective bactericide system {{was selected to}} prepare active poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) films by three different methods (i) direct melt-mixing, (ii) melt-mixing of preincorporated ZnO into PHBV 18 (18 mol% valerate content) fiber mats made by electrospinning, and, (iii) as a coating of the annealed electrospun PHBV 18 /ZnO fiber <b>mats</b> over compression <b>molded</b> PHBV. Results showed that ZnO successfully improved the thermal stability of the PHBV 18, being the preincorporation method the most efficient in mitigating the negative impact that the PHBV 18 had on the thermal stability, barrier and optical properties of the PHBV films. Similar behavior was found for the coating structure although this film showed effective and prolonged antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes. This study highlights the suitability of the PHBV/ZnO nanostructures for active food packaging and food contact surface applications.
