In the ancient Zarathustrian Parsi community to which, on my father's side, I have the honour to belong, this ceremony is normally performed, as in other Faiths, in childhood, or owing to special circumstances as in my case, later in life, when I assumed my name as it now is or, {{in the words of the}} legal document in which this is mentioned [...] "...received into the Parsi community and in accordance with the custom and tradition thereof, is now and will be henceforth known as..."

500|$|Despite the {{positive}} reviews and its popularity among music blogs, [...] "Love Ballad" [...] failed to chart anywhere. In {{an interview with}} Gulf Times, Lo said she thought the song's poor commercial reception was due to her change of stage name. She stated, [...] " [...] didn't sell particularly well. I'd used <b>my</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> Tove Nilsson, when I was in Tremblebee so perhaps no-one knew who I was".|$|E

2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows <b>my</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E

[...] "Good night. My very proper chaperon is dreadfully shocked at this midnight interview, and is taking me away. Only think of it, Milly; he actually proposed to me to walk in the garden with him! Good night, or, as my ancestors--don't forget, MY ANCESTORS--used to say: 'Buena noche--hasta manana!'"

6000|$|This Gylle Krist, the unconsciously fatal individual, who [...] "spoke Norse imperfectly," [...] {{declared}} {{himself to be}} the natural son of whilom Magnus Barefoot; born to him there while engaged in that unfortunate [...] "Conquest of Ireland." [...] "Here is my mother come with me," [...] said Gilchrist, [...] "who declares <b>my</b> <b>real</b> baptismal <b>name</b> to have been Harald, given me by that great King; and who will carry the red-hot ploughshares or do any reasonable ordeal in testimony of these facts. I am King Sigurd's veritable half-brother: what will King Sigurd think it fair to do with me?" [...] Sigurd clearly seems to have believed the man to be speaking truth; and indeed nobody to have doubted but he was. Sigurd said, [...] "Honorable sustenance shalt thou have from me here. But, under pain of extirpation, swear that, neither in my time, nor in that of my young son Magnus, wilt thou ever claim any share in this Government." [...] Gylle swore; and punctually kept his promise during Sigurd's reign. But during Magnus's, he conspicuously broke it; and, in result, through many reigns, and during three or four generations afterwards, produced unspeakable contentions, massacrings, confusions in the country he had adopted. There are reckoned, {{from the time of}} Sigurd's death (A.D. 1130), about a hundred years of civil war: no king allowed to distinguish himself by a solid reign of well-doing, or by any continuing reign at all,--sometimes as many as four kings simultaneously fighting;--and in Norway, from sire to son, nothing but sanguinary anarchy, disaster and bewilderment; a Country sinking steadily as if towards absolute ruin. Of all which frightful misery and discord Irish Gylle, styled afterwards King Harald Gylle, was, by ill destiny and otherwise, the visible origin: an illegitimate Irish Haarfagr who proved to be his own destruction, and that of the Haarfagr kindred altogether! ...|$|R
