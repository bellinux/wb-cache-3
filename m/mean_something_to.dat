25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E

It produced a film, Waters of Destiny, characterized by author Michael Grunwald as propaganda, that likened nature to a villainous, shrieking force of rage and declared the C's mission was to tame nature and make the Everglades useful. Everglades National Park management and Marjory Stoneman Douglas initially supported the C, as it promised to maintain the Everglades and manage the water responsibly. However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas: [...] "The aesthetic appeal of the Park can never be {{as strong as the}} demands of home and livelihood. The manatee and the orchid <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> people in an abstract way, but the former cannot line their purse, nor the latter fill their empty bellies." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Little Mix begun {{recording}} {{songs for}} their debut album. The group worked with production team TMS, and Iain James {{on a number}} of songs at The Music Shed in London, England, four of which were chosen for the album. One of these four songs was [...] "DNA," [...] which subsequently became the title of the album. The song originated from the group's personal experiences in romantic situations. The group wanted to create a song about their own experiences so that they could improve the quality of their live performances. Edwards said: [...] "We perform better when the lyrics <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> us when we sing them." [...] "DNA" [...] was developed to manifest a completely different side to Little Mix. When creating the song, Little Mix took into consideration which of their performances during their time on The X Factor was the most popular. Their performance of Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] was the week during The X Factor where the group received the most votes. The group's version of [...] "E.T." [...] was perceived as [...] "quite dark" [...] by Jade Thirlwall, in turn, Thirlwall said that the group wanted [...] "DNA" [...] to showcase a darker side of the group. Thirlwall told Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post that the song was also inspired to show how the group has grown in maturity.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E

2500|$|The Colour and the Shape {{has been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, and grunge by professional reviewers. Much of the lyricism found on the album revolves around battered romanticism, more specifically the dissolution of Grohl and Jennifer Youngblood's marriage {{during the winter of}} 1996, which Grohl described as [...] "the winter of my discontent." [...] The album's track sequence reflects this sentiment, chronicling his change from chaos to newfound happiness. Although Grohl admitted the lyricism found on Foo Fighters was obscure and [...] "nonsense," [...] Norton pushed Grohl to write lyrics that had meaning. Grohl also found new strength in his singing compared to the insecurities on his voice for the debut, and delved deeper into his feelings with the lyrics, with him stating that [...] "there was a new freedom: 'Wow, I can actually write about things I feel strongly about and things that <b>mean</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me and things I wouldn't normally say in everyday conversation.'"
