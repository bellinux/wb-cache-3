5000|$|Aegopodium podagraria L. {{commonly}} called ground elder, herb gerard, bishop's weed, goutweed, gout wort, and snow-in-the-mountain, and sometimes called English <b>masterwort,</b> and wild <b>masterwort,</b> is a perennial {{plant in the}} carrot family (Apiaceae) that grows in shady places. The name [...] "ground elder" [...] comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (Sambucus), which is unrelated. It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium. This species is native to Eurasia, and has been introduced {{around the world as}} an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.|$|E
50|$|All {{the herbs}} {{mentioned}} in the book, such as burdock, goosefoot, <b>masterwort,</b> woundwort, dragon's blood and poppy juice, were used by medieval healers for the same (and other) purposes as in the story.|$|E
50|$|Peucedanum ostruthium or Imperatoria ostruthium, <b>Masterwort,</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountains of Central and Southern Europe, but has been widely introduced outside its native range.|$|E
50|$|Astrantia bavarica, {{common name}} <b>masterwort,</b> is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Apiaceae, native to Eastern alps. Growing to 30 cm tall by 30 cm broad, it is an herbaceous perennial, much used in gardens.|$|E
50|$|The only {{food plant}} for both adults and larvae is the <b>Masterwort</b> (Peucedanum ostruthium {{in the family}} Apiaceae). The adults are 8 - 10 mm long. Elytra are bright {{metallic}} green crossed by longitudinal blue stripes, or metallic blue.|$|E

50|$|<b>Masterwort</b> is {{native to}} the {{mountains}} of Central and Southern Europe, including the Carpathians, Alps, northern Apennines, Massif Central and isolated occurrences in the Iberian Peninsula. It has, however, been widely introduced and cultivated and its native range is therefore not entirely clear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Masterwort</b> {{is used as}} a {{flavouring}} {{for various}} liqueurs and bitters. Its roots and leaves have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea, liqueurs and wine) and externally (as fumigation, tincture or incense) for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, cardiovascular system, infections, fever, flu and colds.|$|E
50|$|Angelica atropurpurea, known {{commonly}} as purplestem angelica, great angelica, American angelica, high angelica, and <b>masterwort,</b> is {{a species}} of flowering plant {{that can be found}} in moist and swampy woodlands, mostly by riverbanks, in eastern North America. It has been found in eastern Canada (Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Labrador, Newfoundland, all 3 Maritime Provinces) and the United States (from New England south as far as North Carolina, and west to Minnesota, Iowa, and Tennessee).|$|E
50|$|Orvietan was a {{concoction}} of partially toxic herbs, wine, and dissolved honey, but {{existed in}} powdered form too (sold in lead boxes). Patrizia Catellani and Renzo Console analyzed 35 different recipes for mixing orvietan, published between 1655 and 1857. The number of ingredients varies from 9 to 57. The most frequent 26 ingredients are: garden angelica, healing wolfsbane, birthwort, bistort, sweet flag, Carline thistle, dittany, gentian, <b>masterwort,</b> black salsify, tormentil, valerian, blessed thistle, dittany of Crete, rue, germander, laurel berries, juniper berries, cinnamon, cloves, viper meat, {{and the two}} concoctions mithridate and theriac, as well as white wine and honey.|$|E
50|$|B. bohemicus is an obligate parasite, {{and so it}} {{is almost}} always found in {{association}} with a host nest. It parasitizes Bombus locurum, Bombus cryptarum, and Bombus terrestris. In the short time that B. bohemicus is independently foraging, it feeds on the nectar of flowering plants. It shows preference to a diverse selection of scrub-type food plants across its large geographical range, such as: thyme, scabious, knapweed, ling, lavender, <b>masterwort,</b> marsh, and thistles for the male, and sallow, dandelion, clover, bilberry, sycamore, cornflowers, bistort, bugle, thyme, cotoneaster, heath, and raspberry for the female. After invading the host nest, it will be fed by the foraging host workers according to their particular foraging habits.|$|E
50|$|Angelic acid {{occurs in}} the roots of many plants, {{especially}} of the family Apiaceae. These plants include Angelica archangelica, Peucedanum ostruthium (<b>masterwort),</b> Levisticum officinale (lovage), Euryangium sumbul and Laserpitium latifolium. In the latter plant, it {{is present in the}} resin called laserpicium, and the oil of carrot also contains angelic acid. Sumbul plants might contain not angelic acid itself, but a larger complex which breaks into angelic acid upon processing. The acid can also be extracted from the oil of chamomile flowers, and 85% of Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) oil consists of esters of angelic and tiglic acids; it also contains isobutyl angelate and amyl angelate. The acid content is highest in Angelica archangelica where it is about 0.3%.|$|E
50|$|The predominant, {{extensive}} {{stands of}} stone pine (Pinus pinea) here are worth commenting on. They {{belong to the}} largest in Carinthia. The subalpine forests are often thinned out like a park, with an undergrowth including the ubiquitous rusty-leaved alpenrose (Rhododendron ferrugineum), {{as well as the}} alpine juniper (Juniperus communis subsp. alpina) and the spotted gentian (Gentiana punctata). On the Rauterriegel southeast of the Eisenhut, there is a spruce forest with a lot of stone pines. In the green alder (Alnus viridis) bushes at the avalanche slope southeast of the Rinsennock, there are many herbaceous tall forbs, such as monkshood(Aconitum napellus subsp. tauricum), <b>masterwort</b> (Peucedanum ostruthium), and Austrian doronicum (Doronicum austriacum). On the Kilnprein, there are large fields of mugo pine (Pinus mugo).|$|E
40|$|Peucedanum ostruthium (<b>Masterwort)</b> in Banffshire (v. c. 94) Peucedanum ostruthium is a Nationally Scarce archaeophyte, {{recorded}} from 85 hectads in GB & Ireland in {{the period}} 1987 – 1999 (Preston et al 2002), and is classified as Near Threatened (Cheffings and Farrell 2005). In GB it has a northern distribution, from the Peak District to NE Scotland, Orkney and Shetland. Tetrad distribution of Peucedanum ostruthium in Banffshire. Tetrads with records for the period 1980 – 2009 are in black, pre- 1980 in blue. Relief shading is at 50 m intervals up to 200 m AOD, then at 100 m intervals. Areas above 500 m AOD are in blue, and above 900 m in pink (Digital Map Data Copyright © Bartholomew 2007). The vice-county boundary is shown as a black line (© All rights reserved.

40|$|Using Radix imperatoriae (the root of <b>masterwort)</b> as an example, we {{describe}} an efficient approach for the isolation, identification {{and evaluation of}} bioactive plant components on an analytical scale. The extraction of Radix imperatoriae with ethyl acetate was enhanced by the application of ultrasound oscillations. This rhizome extract was applied to three pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) to determine its antimicrobial activity. Disk diffusion was utilized to determine susceptibility. The extract components were separated using a series of chromatography approaches (semi-preparative RP-HPLC, or RP-HPLC on an analytical scale), followed by testing. All fractions were analyzed by LC-UV-ESI-MS and 600 MHz microcoil H NMR spectroscopy. Among other findings, in the fraction with the highest antibacterial activity {{we were able to}} identify oxypeucedanin and oxypeucedanin hydrate. Subsequent analysis revealed that only oxypeucedanin hydrate had antibacterial activity, whereas oxypeucedanin itself was inactive at the concentrations applied. Furthermore, oxypeucedanin hydrate appears to be largely, or exclusively, a by-product of sample preparation, since it is either not synthesized by the plant as a second metabolite or is produced by it in only very small quantities...|$|E
