40|$|Abstract: For several years, <b>marketplaces</b> {{exist in}} the {{software}} industry, where customers can, for instance, search for specific services offered by different vendors, review, buy and use these services. The vendor-sided characteristics of these <b>marketplaces</b> are widely discussed but {{have not yet been}} investigated in detail. In this paper, we consider online <b>marketplaces</b> and the participants as part of a Software Ecosystem. First, we derive vendor-sided characteristics of a Software Ecosystem from existing literature and introduce FaDOM – a newly developed software Framework for Automated Data Collection in Online <b>Marketplaces.</b> On basis of the collected data, we analyze vendor-sided characteristics of five online <b>marketplaces.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Interest in, {{and the use}} of, {{electronic}} <b>marketplaces,</b> if {{less than}} {{at the height of}} the dot. com boom, appears to be enduring, and is therefore an important area for continuing academic study. Electronic <b>marketplaces</b> were heralded as allowing buyers to find new suppliers more easily, compare their offerings and if appropriate switch between them. However, sellers have proved reluctant to participate in <b>marketplaces</b> where they perceive the over-riding criterion for comparison with competitors is that of price, contributing to the failure of a number of <b>marketplaces.</b> This study seeks to explore the impact of electronic <b>marketplaces</b> on the relationship between buyers and suppliers. In particular, it seeks to determine if the ''move to the middle'' hypothesis put forward by Clemons et al. will be supported in this domain. Case studies of buying organisations, in four distinct industries, that are participating in electronic <b>marketplaces</b> were undertaken. It was found that the adoption of electronic <b>marketplaces</b> has led to a reduction in supplier numbers and to the deepening of relationships with them. Rather than replace human relationships, the establishment of electronic communications between organisations has resulted in increased person-to-person communication. The findings of this study suggest that electronic <b>marketplaces</b> can form an important part of an IT enabled supplier relationship management strategy...|$|R

5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{regulated}} {{commerce and}} the economy by creating official markets (tsena) and standardizing market scales (fandanjana) and other units of measurement, including length and volume. King Andrianampoinimerina established the first <b>marketplace</b> in Antananarivo on the grounds today occupied by the Analakely market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s. Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (Zoma) as market day, when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols. This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley, forming {{what has been called}} the largest open air <b>marketplace</b> in the world. Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever-growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997. Prosperity for the masses in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina's reign, leading to growth in population density.|$|E

Internet based businesses operate in highly unstable environments witnessing shakeouts and changes in the industry structure. In this paper, we focus on the adaptive strategies and paths of adaptation of independent B 2 B <b>marketplaces.</b> The independent B 2 B <b>marketplaces</b> have undergone tremendous change with regard to their business models and products/services. Since their inception as pure market makers, these <b>marketplaces</b> have morphed into integration service providers with market making being one of the functions. What makes the adaptive {{strategies of}} B 2 B <b>marketplaces</b> interesting is the extremely short time period within which these changes happened. The research uses the case study methodology to identify the adaptive strategies of B 2 B <b>marketplaces</b> in terms of their product/service class evolution. The results based on the case studies suggest a three-stage adaptation model wherein the <b>marketplaces</b> progress through stages such as aggregation, transactions and integration.

The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the <b>marketplace.</b> They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E

Online <b>marketplaces</b> may have an online auction format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of <b>marketplaces</b> a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online <b>marketplaces,</b> and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, {{registered}} <b>marketplace</b> merchants had a {{very low}} social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the <b>marketplace,</b> where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.|$|E

5|$|The Western Han capital at Chang'an {{was divided}} into one hundred and sixty walled {{residential}} wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, {{it is possible that}} seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in the <b>marketplace.</b> In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into the <b>marketplace</b> daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients. Besides merchants engaging in <b>marketplace</b> violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.|$|E
