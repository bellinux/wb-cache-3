Both stations are exposed daily for more than one hour and are situated in the polyhaline and the <b>mesohaline</b> zone of the estuary. Average density data of non-selective deposit-feeders > predators > epigrowth-feeders > selective deposit-feeders for both stations are presented in spite of different nematode species composition. No difference between Spring and Autumn nor trend over 7 years could be detected. Higher total nematode densities are found at the polyhaline station (average 3200 ind. 10 cm - 2) in comparison with the <b>mesohaline</b> station (average 2300 ind. 10 cm - 2), a difference mainly due to higher non-selective deposit-feeders and predators densities in the polyhaline station. Each year, heterogeneous variance is found for all feeding types at the <b>mesohaline</b> station, but only for epigrowth-feeders and predators at the polyhaline station. The higher nematode density at the polyhaline station is probably caused by the more stable nematode structure. An unstable nematode temporal pattern at the <b>mesohaline</b> station is suggested to be combined with the detritus food chain system in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone. The unstable estuarine habitats are mainly caused by their upstream effects: the River Schelde, which clearly influences the stability of the nematode communities...|$|E

30|$|The higher {{zooplankton}} abundance {{observed during}} the pre-monsoon {{season and the}} lower abundance during the monsoon season, {{in accordance with the}} average seasonal salinity pattern of the estuarine system, generally put forth the question of whether an increase in the salinity always leads to higher zooplankton abundance. The earlier studies depicting the zooplankton distribution, based on the average seasonal salinity and abundance values, support the concept of salinity-influenced zooplankton abundance (Rao et al. 1975; Jyothibabu et al. 2006; Madhu et al. 2007) in the CE. However, the detailed spatio-temporal analysis during the present study evidenced a varied view in the interrelation between salinity and the zooplankton community in this monsoonal estuary. During the pre-monsoon season, though a high-salinity environment (salinity > 18) prevailed in the lower reaches of the estuarine zone, higher zooplankton abundance was observed, mostly at the <b>mesohaline</b> zones (salinity 5 – 18) at the upstream locations, which indicates a positive affinity of the estuarine organisms towards the <b>mesohaline</b> salinity ranges. During the monsoon season, among all the sampling locations in the CE, only the inlet location, station 1, had salinity > 5, and concurrently, higher zooplankton abundance was observed at that station. The higher abundance of zooplankton, mainly at the <b>mesohaline</b> zone of the estuary, during the post-monsoon period also (Figs.  2 and 3) further validates our concept of the preference of <b>mesohaline</b> salinity ranges by the estuarine zooplankton community compared to the very high-salinity environments or very low-salinity environments. Though the result of our study differs from the observation of Kimmerer et al. (1998) on the distribution of a major population of estuarine zooplankton in the low-salinity zone of the temperate San Francisco estuary, the findings of Cronin et al. (1962) in the Delaware estuary clearly support our view of the affinity of estuarine organisms towards the <b>mesohaline</b> zone.|$|E

In <b>mesohaline</b> conditions, concentrations ranged from 21.5 to 272.9 μg/L and, as in oligohaline conditions, were highest in April and lowest in January. Under polyhaline conditions, concentrations of Chl a were highest in May (94.0 μg/L) and lowest in November (7.1 μg/L).

30|$|Since copepods {{formed the}} {{predominant}} zooplankton taxon, contributing > 87  % {{of the total}} abundance, and are in accordance with earlier observations (Madhupratap 1987; Madhu et al. 2007), the present study, depicting the detailed spatio-temporal distribution, community composition, and species-specific abundance pattern, helped considerably in {{a better understanding of}} the ecology of the zooplankton community of this estuarine system. Irrespective of the season, the higher preponderances of the copepod community in the <b>mesohaline</b> zones of the estuary clearly validate their affinity towards the <b>mesohaline</b> environment. With the evident intense seasonality in the abiotic variables and in copepod abundance, a prominent change is also expected in the copepod community structure and in the relative contribution of different species towards the total copepod population. But, the higher contribution of the <b>mesohaline</b> species A. plumosa and B. similis, a euryhaline opportunistic colonizing paracalanoid, towards the higher abundance in the <b>mesohaline</b> zones of the CE, irrespective of season, points towards a significant role they play in the sustenance of the copepod community in this estuarine system. Prior reports on the higher abundance of B. similis and A. plumosa in different tropical estuaries along the Indian coast (Goswami 1982; Ramaiah et al. 1996; Dalal and Goswami 2001) are in agreement with our findings in the CE. The predominantly omnivorous diet of both these copepod species, along with their short generation time of 7 – 10 days (VanderLugt and Lenz 2009), might have favored their contribution towards higher abundance in the <b>mesohaline</b> zones of the estuarine region. Hence, the observation of the higher abundance and dominance of these copepods and their preferences for the <b>mesohaline</b> zones of the estuary throughout the study period further substantiate the concept of considering them the most suitable estuarine endemic among the copepod community for this tropical monsoonal estuary. The evident pattern of distribution and abundance of the copepods P. annandalei and O. brevicornis as the characterizing species of all three seasons, along with A. plumosa and B. similis, suggest their supporting role in the sustenance of the estuarine copepod community. Hence, the view on the vital role of the allochthonous population in the maintenance of the estuarine zooplankton abundance compared to the autochthonous populations, as observed in the temperate EMS estuary by Baretta and Malschaert (Baretta and Malschaert 1988), seems inapplicable in the case of this typical tropical monsoonal estuarine system.|$|E

In spring and summer highest numbers were caught in Zandvliet. The analysis of all surveys performed in spring and autumn indicated that the fish assemblage in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone differs from that in the other zones. The fish assemblage in the other zones does not differ that much. Overall, 1995 - 2014 campaigns, there is a strong difference between spring and autumn catches. The ecological status of freshwater zone remained in a “Good Ecological Potential”. Although the EQR for oligohaline zone increased its status remained “poor”. In 2014 the <b>mesohaline</b> zone had a “moderate” status. The presence of different life stages of several fish species is an indication that some use it as spawning and/or nursery grounds.

40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} {{organic matter}} was sampled monthly between June 1999 and April 2000 in the Scheldt river and estuary to investigate the seasonal and spatial patterns of delta 13 C and delta 15 N signatures. delta 15 N of suspended matter showed large seasonal variation. Minimum values ranged from - 0. 5 promille in the freshwater zone (spring situation) to + 2. 3 promille in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone (winter situation). Maximum values (summer situation) ranged from + 8. 8 promille in the freshwater zone to + 12. 9 promille in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone. delta 13 C showed less seasonal variation and ranged overall from - 31. 1 promille in the freshwater zone to - 23. 7 promille in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone. During the growth season, decrease of delta 13 C and increase of delta 15 N of suspended matter were due to local phytoplanktonic and bacterial biomass. There is strong evidence that the delta 15 N enrichment of suspended matter during the growth season reflects the delta 15 N enrichment of the ambient NH 4 + pool induced by nitrification and NH 4 + uptake. Zooplankton in the <b>mesohaline</b> section of the river was consistently enriched in delta 15 N relative to suspended matter but followed its seasonal trend. During summer and autumn the isotopic offset between zooplankton and the suspended {{particulate organic matter}} was consistent with a pattern of selective feeding on phytoplankton. During summer, delta 15 N of zooplankton reached a value as high as + 25. 5 promille, the highest value observed during this study. During spring, present-day delta 15 N of suspended matter in the oligohaline and <b>mesohaline</b> section increased compared to the 1970 s, probably because today nitrification, which enriches the NH 4 + pool in delta 15 N, starts earlier in the season. For summer, the discrepancy between present-day suspended matter delta 15 N values and those observed in the 1970 s was even larger, especially in the oligohaline and freshwater reaches, probably {{as a result of}} improved O 2 conditions now favouring nitrification. Likewise, the present decreased input of delta 15 N-depleted sewage will enhance delta 15 N enrichment of suspended matter during the growth season...|$|E
40|$|Elimination {{kinetics}} of six tetra-, penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls {{were investigated}} in Nereis diversicolor from two {{populations of the}} Weser Estuary by laboratory experiments. Elimination half-lives increased in the order 101, 52, 87, 44, 95, 153 (IUPAC Nos.) indicating the importance of PCB structure. At appropriate salinities, 10 ppt and 25 ppt, ragworms from the possibly more contaminated <b>mesohaline</b> site eliminated these components considerably faster than those from the polyhaline site. Worms from the <b>mesohaline</b> site also had considerably more polar transformation products of No. 52, which had been applied super(14) C-labelled.

40|$|The <b>mesohaline</b> {{portion of}} the Chesapeake Bay is subject to annual summertime hypoxia and anoxia in waters beneath the pycnocline. This {{dissolved}} oxygen deficit {{is directly related to}} salinity-based stratification of the water column in combination with high levels of autochthonously produced organic matter and a very high abundance of metabolically active bacteria. Throughout the water column in the lower, <b>mesohaline</b> part of the bay, between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, near the southern limit of the mainstem anoxia, bacterial abundance often exceeded 10 × 106 cells per ml and bacterial production exceeded 7 × 109 cells per liter per day during summer. Bacterial biomass averaged 34 % (range, 16 to 126 %) of the phytoplankton biomass in summer. These values are equal to or greater than those found farther north in the bay, where the oxygen deficit is more severe. Seasonal variations in bacterial abundance and production were correlated with phytoplankton biomass (lag time, 7 to 14 days), particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and particulate biochemical oxygen demand in spring; but during summer, they were significantly correlated only with dissolved biochemical oxygen demand. During summer, dissolved biochemical oxygen demand can account for 50 to 60 % of the total biochemical oxygen demand throughout the water column and 80 % in the bottom waters. There is a clear spring-summer seasonal shift in the production of organic matter and in the coupling of bacteria and autochthonous organic matter. The measurement of dissolved, microbially labile organic matter concentrations is crucial in understanding the trophic dynamics of the lower <b>mesohaline</b> part of the bay. The absolute levels of organic matter in the water column and the bacterial-organic carbon relationships suggest that a lower bay source of organic matter fuels the upper <b>mesohaline</b> bay oxygen deficits...|$|E

The distinct groups of the station locations, based on the abundance of different copepod species, showed a close affinity towards the different salinity ranges, signifying the role of salinity in their abundance and distribution (Fig.  7 a). The higher abundance of both A. plumosa and B. similis in the <b>mesohaline</b> region (Fig.  7 b, c) and the negative relation of sex ratio with their abundance values (Fig.  10) indicate towards the role of sex ratio in maintaining their high population in the <b>mesohaline</b> environment of the estuary.|$|E
30|$|The evident {{heterogeneity}} in {{the spatial}} and temporal abundance, community composition, and diversity indices of the copepod community in the CE is governed mainly by the species-specific sensitivity and subsequent responses of the organisms towards the prime limiting abiotic variable, salinity. In spite of the prominent unsteadiness in the salinity characteristics induced by the seasonal variability in the precipitation regime and fluvial fluxes influenced by the Indian summer monsoon (Revichandran et al. 2012), the maximum zooplankton abundance always occurred at the <b>mesohaline</b> zone of the estuary, which experienced a seasonal shift from the lower reaches of the estuary during the monsoon season to the middle reaches during the post-monsoon season and ultimately towards the upstream locations of the estuary during the pre-monsoon period, {{in contrast to the}} expected high-salinity zones of the estuary. The dominant zooplankton taxon, copepods (> 87  %), {{played a crucial role in}} the maintenance of the higher abundance of the zooplankton community in the <b>mesohaline</b> zones of the estuary. Depending on the seasonal variability in salinity, though a few high-saline and low-saline species flourished in the lower and upper reaches of the estuary, respectively, the estuarine copepod community was dominated by the preponderance of the <b>mesohaline</b> and euryhaline copepods A. plumosa and B. similis, along with O. brevicornis and P. annandalei, as the characterizing species, irrespective of the season. The role of sex ratio in the maintenance of the higher abundance of the dominant estuarine endemic species in the <b>mesohaline</b> region was another important finding in the present study, and in the seasonal scenario, the bias in the sex ratio towards female skewness might have favored higher reproductive output, resulting in the higher abundance during the favorable pre-monsoon period. Hence, the species-specific sensitivity to the seasonal changes in the salinity distribution of the copepod community played a prominent role in determining their abundance pattern in the CE, and the trend in the sex ratio of the dominant copepods towards female dominance further aided in sustaining the higher abundances in the <b>mesohaline</b> zone. Considering the limited study on tropical monsoonal estuarine zooplankton dynamics, the results of the present study will be relevant in the better understanding of the unique population sustenance of the estuarine endemic zooplankton community. Further studies can be focused towards understanding the mechanisms that lead to the biasness in the sex ratio of the estuarine endemic copepod species.|$|E
40|$|Common reed (Phragmites australis) is a {{prominent}} {{species in the}} upstream part of the eutrophic Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). From 1996 till 1998, seasonal growth dynamics of the species were studied in two monospecific stands subjected to different salinity regimes (seasonal means 1. 6 and 13. 3 PSU, respectively). We addressed the following questions: how are these reed vegetations affected by meteorological conditions and by the growth site, what are the important growth processes {{and what is the}} fate of the annually fixed carbon. A mathematical model was developed and calibrated using the data from the oligohaline site. Subsequent application of the model to the <b>mesohaline</b> stand required adaptation of parameters relating to the partitioning of resources and timing of growth initiation only. At their peak, the aboveground biomass was 587 - 1678 g DW m - 2 at the 13. 3 PSU site and 1116 - 2179 g DW m - 2 (1. 6 PSU); more than 60 % of the biomass was located underground. In 1996, biomasses were 2 - 3 times lower than in the other 2 years, caused by a retarded growth initiation. Probably due to a lower temperature in early 1996, rhizome bud burst occurred more than 1 month later compared to the other years. In addition, growth initiation was several weeks later in the <b>mesohaline</b> site. This appeared mainly responsible for the large difference in maximal aboveground biomass between both stations. Architecture of the plants was also affected, with a higher shoot density (about 50 % more shoots), better-developed root system (15 % of total belowground biomass compared to 5 %) and more, but smaller leaves at the higher salinity site. Notwithstanding large differences in aboveground biomass, annual growth was similar at both stations (154 and 132 mol C m - 2 per year at the oligo- and <b>mesohaline</b> station, respectively). Primary production accounted for about 80 % of all growth processes, rhizome remobilization for almost 20 %, translocation of mass before sloughing of leaves accounting about 3 %. Within a year, some 44 % (oligohaline) and 36 % (<b>mesohaline)</b> of new assimilates produced by photosynthesis accumulated as dead litter. The other part was respired by the plant itself, either to provide the energy for growth (23 %) or maintenance costs (33 - 41 % at the oligo- and <b>mesohaline</b> station, respectively).

The index consists {{of a variety of}} benthic community metrics (e. g. abundance, biomass, diversity, stress tolerance groups, etc.) scored by thresholds applied to seven benthic community habitats (tidal freshwater, oligohaline, low <b>mesohaline,</b> high <b>mesohaline</b> mud, high <b>mesohaline</b> sand, polyhaline mud, and polyhaline sand) This index was verified as being a sensitive and robust tool for summarizing the status of benthic communities. In our study we tested the classification efficiency of the index using new benthic data by characterizing each sample a priori as degraded or undegraded using criteria of sediment contaminant levels, bioassays and bottom dissolved oxygen levels. A primary objective of our study was to test the classification efficiency of the B-IBI in small water bodies connected to larger water bodies of the mainstems of the large rivers of Chesapeake Bay, as well as the efficiency of the index over time (1990 through 2009). The B-IBI was affected {{by the size of the}} water body, e. g., index accuracy was higher for water bodies in small watersheds in lower salinity habitats, whereas large water bodies of the mainstem of rivers were better classified by the B-IBI in habitats with higher salinities. Across the seven benthic habitat types overall correct classification was moderate to low and lower for correctly classifying undegraded sites. In general the index metrics showed some deficiencies that suggest improvements could be made by recalibrating existing metric thresholds or selecting new suitable metrics.

40|$|Measurements of {{nutrient}} concentrations {{and nutrient}} uptake rates {{were collected from}} three stations in the James River/Elizabeth River complex. In the tidal fresh James River, monthly experiments were conducted to determine the dominant nutrients controlling cyanobacteria growth in the summer months. Weekly experiments were conducted in the <b>mesohaline</b> James River and in {{the headwaters of the}} Lafayette River (a tributary of the Elizabeth River) to determine nutrient controls on the annual dinoflagellate bloom, Cochlodinium polykrikoides. In 2012, there was no mono-specific cyanobacteria bloom of Microcystis as had been seen in the past, however increased chlorophyll a concentrations appeared to be fueled by forms of regenerated nitrogen such as ammonium, urea, and dissolved organic nitrogen. Although di-nitrogen fixation was measured, it was {{a very small percentage of}} the total nitrogen uptake for the tidal fresh station. The dinoflagellate bloom, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, initiated in the headwaters of the Lafayette River earlier than had been seen in years past (end of June) and lasted through August. The bloom spread to the poly- and <b>mesohaline</b> James River, and no particular nitrogen compound is sited as being a trigger for the bloom, however the bloom sustained itself on regenerated nitrogen compounds...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{different}} Italian late Messinian lago-mare ostracod assemblages, dominated mainly by extinct Paratethyan species, have been analysed {{by means of}} Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The obtained plots have been compared and, {{with the help of}} the limited autoecological data on similar living species and geochemical data on the sediments in which they were included, the autoecology and synecology of the lago-mare assemblages have been inferred. In particular, it seems reasonable to suppose that: 1) assemblages made only by pointed candonids are typical of rather deep (possibly less than one hundred meters of depth) and freshwater/oligohaline environments; 2) assemblages mainly composed of Leptocytheridae point to shallow (probably few tens of meters of depth) and <b>mesohaline</b> waters; 3) diversified and even assemblages made both by pointed candonids and Leptocytheridae are common in rather deep (less than one hundred meters of depth) but oligo/low <b>mesohaline</b> environments; 4) Caspiocypris seems rather tolerant of brackish salinities, but prefers shallow environments; 5) Tyrrhenocythere could be an indicator of shallow and fresh/oligohaline waters. 6) Cyprideis is an indicator of shallow waters but can withstand a very wide salinity range...|$|E
40|$|The present study, based {{mainly on}} the {{analysis}} of foraminifers and ostracodes, provides evidence of paleoenvironmental changes on the coastal plain of Marathon (E. Greece) during the last 6. 000 yrs. Three sedimentary units -lagoonal formations - were recognized and identified as A, B and C. They range in time between before 5500 BP- 3500 BP, 3500 BP- 2500 BP and 2500 BP-recent, respectively. The study of the brackish marsh microfauna of the Marathon plain Holocene sediments reveals the presence, during the last 5500 yrs., of three distinct biofacies in the sedimentary units already established. Alternating <b>mesohaline</b> - oligohaline (MO), oligohaline - fresh water (OFW) and <b>mesohaline</b> - oligohaline to oligohaline - fresh water (MO-OFW) biofacies {{in the framework of}} the sedimentary units indicate a general trend landward along the plain suggesting a slowing of sea-level rise probably correlated with a relevant tectonic uplift. One prominent feature of this study is the clarification of the ecological preference of the species Trichohya 1 us aguayoi (Bermudez, 1935), which is dominant in oligohaline conditions under an influence of fresh water input (salinity less than 15 ‰).  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} value of flounder from shore angling around Ireland was assessed. Flounder catches from shore angling tournaments around Ireland {{were related to}} domestic and overseas shore angling expenditure {{in order to determine}} an {{economic value}} for the species. Temporal trends in flounder angling catches, and specimen (trophy) flounder reports were also investigated. Flounder was found to be the most caught shore angling species in competitions around Ireland constituting roughly one third of the shore angling competition catch although this did vary by area. The total value of flounder from shore angling tourism was estimated to be of the order of € 8. 4 million. No significant temporal trends in flounder angling catches and specimen reports were found. Thus there is no evidence from the current study for any decline in flounder stocks. The population dynamics of 0 -group flounder during the early benthic stage was investigated at estuarine sites in Galway Bay, west of Ireland. Information was analysed from the March to June sampling period over five years (2002 to 2006). Spatial and temporal variations in settlement and population length structure were analysed between beach and river habitats and sites. Settlement of flounder began from late March to early May of each year, most commonly in April. Peak settlement was usually in April or early May. Settlement was recorded earlier than elsewhere, although most commonly was similar to {{the southern part of the}} UK and northern France. Settlement was generally later in tidal rivers than on sandy beaches. Abundance of 0 -group flounder in Galway Bay did not exhibit significant inter -annual variability. 0 -group flounder were observed in dense aggregations of up to 105 m' 2, which were patchy in distribution. Highest densities of 0 -group flounder were recorded in limnetic and oligohaline areas as compared with the lower densities in polyhaline and to a lesser extent <b>mesohaline</b> areas. Measurements to of salinity allowed the classification of beaches, and tidal river sections near the mouth, into a salinity based scheme for length comparisons. Beaches were classified as polyhaline,the lower section of rivers as <b>mesohaline,</b> and the middle and upper sections as oligohaline. Over the March to June sampling period 0 -group flounder utilised different sections at different length ranges and were significantly larger in more upstream sections. During initial settlement in April, 0 -group flounder of 8 - 10 mm (standard length, SL) were present in abundance on polyhaline sandy beaches. By about 10 mm (SL), flounder were present in all polyhaline, <b>mesohaline</b> and (oligohaline) sections. 0 -group flounder became absent or in insignificant numbers in polyhaline and <b>mesohaline</b> sections in a matter of weeks after first appearance. From April to June, 0 -group flounder of 12 - 30 mm (SL) were found in more upstream locations in the oligohaline sections. About one month (May or June) after initial settlement, 0 -group flounder became absent from the oligohaline sections. Concurrently, flounder start to reappear in <b>mesohaline</b> and polyhaline areas at approximately 30 mm (SL) in June. The results indicate 0 -group flounder in the early benthic stage are associated with low salinity areas, but as they grow, this association diminishes. Results strongly suggest that migration of 0 -group flounder between habitats takes place during the early benthic phase...|$|E
30|$|Though in CE {{relatively}} low copepod diversity (H′ < 2) was observed across the seasons, the seasonal {{variability in the}} H′ value observed {{during the study period}} helped further in {{a better understanding of the}} variability occurring in the seasonal composition of the copepod community. The low species diversity of copepods during the monsoon period might have resulted due to the absence of high-saline marine migrants with a salinity preference > 20, and a similar feature has also been observed in other monsoonal estuarine systems along the Indian coast (Goswami 1982) and also in the coastal waters of this region (Stephen 1977). The interesting feature evident in the seasonal diversity and abundance pattern with high abundance during the pre-monsoon season and high H′ during the post-monsoon season augmented the need to understand the role of community composition during periods of varying abundance and diversity. During the post-monsoon season, though salinity progressively increased, a wide salinity range prevailed in the estuary (salinity—St. 1 – 4 [*]>[*] 18, St. 5 [*]>[*] 5 and < 18, and St. 6, 7, and 8, < 5), which in turn triggered different copepod species to inhabit niches of preferred salinity ranges in the estuary with maximum abundance at the <b>mesohaline</b> middle reaches. This was evident from the restricted occurrence of the low-saline copepod species P. malayalus and H. cinctus (salinity preference < 10) in the southern limb of the estuary and several high-saline species (salinity preference > 20) in the polyhaline region (salinity > 18) in or near the two inlets. Most of the medium-saline species had wide distributions in the estuary, based on their specific salinity preferences. In contrast, during the pre-monsoon season, though the abundance was higher, it was mostly contributed by the <b>mesohaline</b> and euryhaline copepods, with maximum abundance in the <b>mesohaline</b> upstream locations. Though several high-saline species were present in varying abundance during this period, the species that had preferences to low salinity were mostly absent in the estuarine zone, resulting in the lower H′ during this period.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the last}} several decades, {{seagrasses}} and related submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) have been lost from shallow waters of Chesapeake Bay (Orth and Moore 1983) and other coastal ecosystems worldwide (Short and Wyllie-Echeverria 1996). Losses of SAV beds are of particular concern because these plants tend to create rich habitat and food for animals, supporting growth of diverse fish, invertebrate and waterfowl populations (e. g., Kemp et al. 1984; Orth and van Montfrans 1990; Heck et al. 1995). In the <b>mesohaline</b> portion of Chesapeake Bay, historical SAV abundance, which had been decimated by the late 1970 s, has gradually increased from the mid- 1980 s to present levels. Compared to historical SAV commu-nities in this region, however, the number of recovering plant species has remained depressed, with one species, Ruppia maritima (widgeon grass), predominating throughout (Orth et al. 1997). This “pioneer ” SAV species is an annual plant with prolific production of viable seeds and high growth potential (Silberhorn et al. 1996; Stevenson et al. 1993; Kautsky 1988). More stable spe-cies, like Potamogeton perfoliatus (redhead grass) and Stuckenia pectinata (sago pondweed), that had previously represented a large component of the SAV community in <b>mesohaline</b> areas of Chesapeake Bay (Stevenson and Confer 1978), are presently scarce in this region (Moore et al...|$|E
40|$|Rich hypo- to <b>mesohaline</b> {{molluscan}} assemblages characterising {{the latest}} Messinian ‘‘Lago-Mare’’ biofacies, composed of prosobranch gastropods (Neritidae, Thiaridae, Melanopsidae, Hydrobiidae) and bivalves {{of the families}} Cardiidae (subfamily Lymnocardiinae) and Dreissenidae, are widespread in shallow water basins characterized by low salinities within the Mediterranean realm, during the post-evaporitic phase in the time-span 5. 5 – 5. 3 Ma. Several genera and species are recorded in the Italian uppermost Messinian sediments. While the gastropods show endemic character being linked to continental water-systems, Lymnocardiinae and Dreissenidae have strong Paratethyan affinity. New records of significant species of Lymnocardiinae from the uppermost Messinian sediments of Tuscany, Marches and Sicily and the systematic review of the old literature data point out close relations of the Italian fauna with that from the Pontian sediments of the Dacic Basin. The palaeobiogeographical data referred to Messinian and Pontian Lymnocardiinae suggest that the Aegean Basin could be an intermediate basin from whence the Pontian Paratethyan-type fauna migrated into the Mediterranean area during the latest Messinian. Since the ecology of Lymnocardiinae is mainly tied to oligo- and <b>mesohaline</b> water, spreading of suitable habitats in depositional systems of marginal settings characterized by increasing freshwater influx after the ‘‘salinity crisis’’ favoured their dispersal into the Mediterranean area from the Paratethys realm...|$|E

30|$|The Sundarbans, the world’s largest {{continuous}} {{patch of}} mangrove forest, {{is located in}} the estuary of the river Ganges-Brahmaputra. The forest is distributed over two neighboring countries, Bangladesh and India. In Bangladesh, the forest covers 6017  km 2 (21 o 30 ′– 22 o 30 ′ N, 89 o 00 ′– 89 o 55 ′ E). It is the first mangrove forest in the world which has been brought under scientific management since 1982, thereafter no apparent forest harvest and catastrophic disturbance have occurred. As recently as 200  years ago the Sundarbans extended across most of southwestern Bangladesh (Islam 2001). From the available literature it is known that during the period 1873 – 1933, the forest was reduced from 7599 to 6000  km 2 (Curtis 1933; Blasco 1977; Iftekhar and Saenger 2008) and in the recent years the boundary is almost same as 6017  km 2. Chaffey et al. (1985) divided the Sundarbans mangrove forest into three ecological zones viz. fresh water (Oligohaline), moderately saline water (<b>Mesohaline)</b> and salt water (Polyhaline) zones. Based on salinity distribution, three salinity zones: Oligohaline (salinity < 2 dsm− 1), <b>Mesohaline</b> (salinity 2 – 4 dsm− 1), Polyhaline (> 4 dsm− 1) zones could be recognized (Siddiqi 2001). Changes in salinity might be responsible for the spatial distribution of plant communities (Ahmed et al. 2011).|$|E
