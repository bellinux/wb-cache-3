5000|$|Game {{theory is}} {{employed}} {{to suggest that}} subordinates suppress their own reproduction to avoid the social cost imposed on them if they reproduce, including expulsion from the group and infanticide against their progeny by dominant breeding individuals. Forced dispersal from the group may be extremely dangerous, involving high levels of predation and difficulty finding food and sleeping sites. In the absence of stress or pheromones as a mechanism, a [...] "self-inhibition"model was proposed that suggests subordinates can choose to inhibit their own reproduction in cooperatively breeding groups {{in order to remain}} flexible and share in the group's productivity. When group members are closely related, independent breeding opportunities are poor, and detection of <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is high, subordinates choose to suppress their own reproduction.The self-inhibition model has been applied to female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). When they are introduced into a new group, female marmosets are immediately subordinate, experience a drop in chrorionic gonadotrophin (CG) and within the first four days and stops ovulating. [...] Subordinate female ovaries are smaller than dominants and secrete little estrogen. Older female marmosets are less subject to ovulatory self-restraint and the scent of an unfamiliar dominant female does not affect their ovulation. However, continued exposure to the dominant female may represent a social, rather than biological, cue that causes the subordinates to shut down their ovulation.|$|E

40|$|Though {{it is well}} {{established}} that chronic stress induces female reproductive dysfunction, whether stress negatively impacts fertility and fecundity when applied prior to <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has not been well explored.

Using naturally cycling female rats, Chapter 2 looks at changes in reproductive hormones and behavior after chronic immobilization stress. I also examined the long-term repercussions of chronic stress, allowing animals recovery from the stressors and looking at later <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> success. My research has focused primarily on the role of a reproductive inhibitory hormone, RFRP- 3, a hypothalamic peptide modulated by high stress. However, in Chapter 3, I investigate a new mechanism for RFRP- 3 outside of that role, in hippocampal astrocytes. I see that RFRP- 3 may also mediate an effect on how astrocytes connect and communicate with each other within the hippocampus. This opens a new intriguing line of research for novel roles of RFRP- 3 outside of reproduction. These studies show that chronic stress has long-term effects on pregnancy success, even post-stressor, that are mediated by RFRP 3, and point to RFRP 3 as a potential clinically-relevant single target for stress-induced infertility...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the reproductive response of adult and prepubertal goats subjected to repeated laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU). The study animals were divided into two groups, specifically, adult nanny goats (GA, n= 10) and prepubertal nanny goats (GP, n= 10), which were subjected to estrous synchronization and ovarian stimulation for LOPU. Both groups underwent six LOPU procedures at seven-day intervals and were subsequently subjected to controlled <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> diagnosis to evaluate their future fertility. The study showed a reduction in the number of follicles visualized and in the amount and quality of the oocytes that were recovered and exposed to in vitro maturation.

Therefore, a viable number of oocytes were obtained even with the decreased reproductive efficiency, proving that repeated LOPUs do not interfere with the reproductive of adult and prepubertal nanny goats.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in goats of the possible seasonal factors which might influence the autumn decline in the average concentration of prolactin released at milking. Serial blood samples were taken during milking, once a month between August and December 1972, from groups of mated, non-mated and ovariectomized goats and also from goats main-tained in summer light conditions (17 h light: 7 h darkness). Since high levels of progesterone occur in the circulation during the major part of the oestrous cycle and pregnancy in the goat, the same sampling procedure was carried out earlier in the year (June=n-) in animals which had been implanted with progesterone tablets. Although high levels of progesterone in the circulation inhibited the release of prolactin at milking, oestrus, <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> were not found to be responsible for the fall in prolactin levels in the blood in the autumn. In each ofthese cases the concentration ofprolactin released atmilking decreased uniformly between August and October. Housing goats in summer lighting conditions, however, maintained the release ofprolactin at milking at a con-sistently high level from August until December, but had no effect on the milk yield which declined {{in a manner similar to}} that of the control animals.

Both HA native and newcomer ewes were maintained at an altitude of 3589 m during <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Control low altitude (LA) native ewes were maintained at sea level. Half of each group received daily oral supplements of vitamins C (500 mg) and E (350 IU) during mating and gestation. Near term, maternal plasma vitamin levels and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured. At delivery, lambs were weighed and measured, and placentas were recovered for macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. Vitamin concentrations in supplemented ewes were two-or threefold greater than in non-supplemented ewes. Plasma carbonyls and malondialdehyde in non-supplemented ewes were consistent with a state of oxidative stress, which was prevented by vitamin supplementation. Vitamin supplementation increased lamb birthweight and cotyledon number in both HA native and newcomer ewes, although placental weight and cotyledon surface were diminished. Placentas from vitamin-supplemented HA ewes were similar to those from ewes at sea level, making these placental traits (weight, number and diameter of cotyledons) similar to those from ewes at sea level. Vitamin supplementation had no effect on LA pregnancies. In conclusion, supplementation with vitamins C and E during pregnancy at HA prevents oxidative stress, improving pregnancy outcomes.

Daily maternal pST injections from d 25 to 50 increase fetal weight at d 50 in gilts and sows. We therefore hypothesized that daily pST injections from d 25 to 100, but not d 25 to 50, of pregnancy would increase birth weight similarly in both parities. Landrace x Large White gilts and sows were uninjected (controls) or were injected daily with pST (gilts: 2. 5 mg/d; sows: 4. 0 mg/d, each approximately 15 microg of pST/kg per day) from d 25 to 50 or 100 of pregnancy.

Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine and compare the developmental toxicity effects including teratogenic and offspring weight effect of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in time mated mice. Methods: Fifty six Balb c mice were divided into seven experimental groups of eight mice each.

The yolk sacs and the trophoblasts of the embryos sired by the heated males were also slightly smaller than those sired by the controls in the two experiments in which these were measured.

Experiments were conducted with mixed-sex twin pairs to determine if the male lamb was able to receive more milk than the female lamb. Sixty ewes were selected after synchronised <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> diagnosis: 30 were twin-bearing and 30 were single-bearing. Half of each group (twin- and single-bearing) were shorn at mid-gestation (approximately 77 days before lambing) and observations of their behaviour and estimations of their food intake were made. Shorn ewes adjusted rapidly to shearing, exhibiting no apparent difference in behaviour one week after shearing. Shearing led to an increase in ewe weight and lamb birth weight. Rearing twins was costly for the twin-bearing ewes: they were lighter, had lower condition scores and less wool growth than ewes with singletons during late-gestation and lactation. Twin lambs were born lighter and grew slower than single lambs. There was no evidence of sex-biased investment in this study. A slight trade-off between gestation and lactation was apparent for shorn, single-bearing ewes. There was no difference between twin lambs born to shorn or full fleece dams. Shearing ewes at mid-gestation appears to be a useful tool for increasing the birth weight of lambs which could lead to an increase in survival of newborn lambs...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} supports {{the hypothesis that}} the in utero environment can have profound implications for fetal development and later life offspring health. Current theory suggests conditions experienced in utero prepare, or “programme”, the fetus for its anticipated post-natal environment. The mechanisms responsible for these programming events are poorly understood but are likely to involve gene expression changes. Folate is essential for normal fetal development and inadequate maternal folate supply during pregnancy has long term adverse effects for offspring. We tested the hypothesis that folate depletion during pregnancy alters offspring programming through altered gene expression. Female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed diets containing 2 mg or 0. 4 mg folic acid/kg for 4 weeks before <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> throughout <b>pregnancy.</b> At 17. 5 day gestation, genome-wide gene expression was measured in male fetal livers and placentas.

Twenty-four female adult Wistar rats were divided into two groups: the control group (G 1) and the group that was submitted to dental ligatures around second upper molars (G 2). After the four week period of development of periodontitis, the female animals were mated with male adult Wistar rats. There were no differences in the body weight of females between the two groups during <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> No differences were observed among the groups in relation to the viable newborn index. However, there were differences in new born birth weight, explained by the diverse size of the litters. In this study, ligature-induced periodontal disease did not promote changes during pregnancy that resulted in low birth weight in newborn Wistar rats...|$|E
40|$|Birth weight {{positively}} predicts postnatal {{growth and}} performance in pigs and can be increased by sustained maternal porcine ST (pST) treatment from d 25 to 100 of pregnancy (term ∼ 115 d). The objective {{of this study was}} to test whether a shorter period of maternal pST treatment in late pregnancy (d 75 to 100) could also increase birth and weaning weights of progeny under commercial conditions. Gilts (parity 0) and sows (parities 2 and 3) were not injected (controls) or injected daily with pST (gilts: 2. 5 mg∙d− 1, sows: 4. 0 mg∙d− 1, both ∼ 13 to 14 μg∙kg− 1 ∙d− 1) from d 75 to 100 of pregnancy. Litter size and BW were recorded at birth and weaning, and dams were followed through the subsequent <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Maternal pST injections from d 75 to 100 increased litter average progeny weight at birth (+ 96 g, P = 0. 034) and weaning (+ 430 g, P = 0. 038) in sows, but had no effect on progeny weight in gilts (each P > 0. 5). Maternal pST treatment did not affect numbers of live-born piglets and increased numbers of stillborn piglets in sows only (+ 0. 4 pigs/litter, P = 0. 034). Maternal pST treatment did not affect subsequent reproduction of dams. Together with our previous data, these results suggest that sustained increases in maternal pST are required to increase fetal and postnatal growth in gilt progeny, but that increasing maternal pST in late pregnancy may only be an effective strategy to increase fetal and possibly postnatal growth in sow progeny.

40|$|The {{similarity}} of the menstrual {{cycle of the}} rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) {{to that of the}} human, makes any data concerning <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in this animal of significant interest. Underlying the menstrual cycle are, of course, the periodic changes in the ovaries, pre-eminently ovulation, and the variable hormone secretions with their attending effects on uterus and vagina, so remarkably alike in both primates. The monkey ovary has been intensively studied in late years and accumulated data concerning times at which ovulations have occurred, when plotted, cover a considerable span of days in the midmenstrual cycle. We have chosen the peak days of this period covered by verified ovulations and have mated our animals for a restricted time. Mating data, in relation to {{the first day of the}} preceding menses, are presented here for a total of one hundred and sixty pregnancies, involving a considerably smaller number of monkeys. The first information to indicate at which time in the menstrual cycle ovulation occurred in the monkey was furnished in 1923 by Corner, 2 when he found an unfertilized tubal ovum on the 15 th day. Allen ' added two similar records for the monkey in 1926 and found the first free human ovum in 1929. A different type of evidence concerning ovulation was available when Hartman 8 (1932, Fig. 6, A) assembled 60 instances of single coitus resulting in pregnancy in monkeys of the Carnegie Colony. Hartman charted these fertile matings and included the Corner and Allen data, giving the probable day of ovulation for the Corner egg as the 10 th and for the Allen ova the 10,th and 12 th days. With the usual procedure of accepting the first day of menses as day one of the cycle, all ovulations fell in midcycle, the earliest on the 9 th and the latest on the 18 th day, with a decided accumulation of points on the 11 th...|$|E
40|$|The double {{staining}} Trypan blue/Giemsa {{has been}} used to evaluate the semen of two stallions (A and B) bred in the same farm. In order to compare the fertility rate of the last mating season with the results of this staining technique, semen samples were collected at 10 days intervals and stained according to Kovács and Foote (1992). Sperm cells were then classified as: live with intact acrosome (VCA), live with acrosome reacted (VAR), dead with intact acrosome (MCA), dead with acrosome reacted (MAR), dead with damaged acrosome (MAD), only sperm head (ST). <b>Mating</b> data <b>and</b> <b>pregnancy</b> rate at 40 days of gestation were collected in order to evaluate the first cycle <b>pregnancy</b> rate <b>and</b> the seasonal <b>pregnancy</b> rate. Differences of pregnancy rate between stallions were analyzed by Chi Square test. Differences of sperm cells percentage in the staining classes were analyzed by ANOVA, after the angular transformations. Seasonal pregnancy rate were different between stallions (85, 7 % vs 52, 9 % in A vs B; P< 0, 05). According to the fertility data, higher percentages of live sperms (P< 0. 01), VCA (P< 0. 01), MAR (P< 0. 05) and lower percentages of VAR (P< 0. 05), MCA (P< 0. 01) and MAD (P< 0. 01) were found in A vs B stallio...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential role of endogenous transplacental transmission of Toxoplasma gondii, 31 seropositive ewes {{presumed to be}} persistently infected with the parasite and 15 seronegative ewes were <b>mated</b> <b>and</b> monitored throughout <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> lambing. Antibody titres were determined in precolostral sera from the liveborn lambs and in thoracic fluid from the dead lambs. A PCR for the B 1 gene of T gondii {{was applied to the}} placentas from all the ewes and to the brains of the stillborn lambs. Samples of brain, lung, liver, spleen and heart from the dead lambs were examined by histopathology. No evidence of toxoplasmosis was detected by histopathology or PCR in any of the samples, but low titres of antibody to T gondii were detected in two liveborn, healthy offspring of a seropositive ewe by the immunofluorescent antibody test (3 · 2 per cent of <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> 4 · 1 per cent of lambs in the seropositive group). Antibody to specific antigens of T gondii was demonstrated in sera from these two lambs by Western blotting...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Current study {{investigates the}} effects of {{maternal}} protein restriction during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> lactation on the testis of immature rats. Female Wistar rats were <b>mated</b> <b>and,</b> after confirming <b>pregnancy,</b> they {{were divided into two}} groups: undernourished group (UG) fed on a diet with casein 8 %, and control group (CG) fed on a diet with casein 17 %, during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> lactation. After weaning, male offspring from the two experimental groups were fed on normal diet up to 35 days old when they were euthanized. Body and testicular weights decreased in UG when compared to those in CG. Volumetric density of seminiferous tubules was higher in CG whilst intertubular space increased in UG. The number of lumenated seminiferous tubules was higher in CG than in UG. Tubular diameter, seminiferous epithelium height and total length of seminiferous tubules were lower in UG. Round spermatids were frequently found in seminiferous tubules cross-section of CG. On the other hand, spermatocytes I in prophases was the germ cell commonly found in seminiferous tubules cross-sections of UG. Undernutrition during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> lactation period of the male Wistar rats altered the morphometric testicular parameters related to tubular compartment and delayed the onset of spermatogenesis...|$|R
