The combinational and exhaustive property make it closely related with the existing <b>code</b> <b>methods.</b> Universal combinatorial <b>coding</b> does not depend on the probability statistic characteristic of information source, and it has the characteristics across three coding branches. It has analyzed the relationship between the universal combinatorial coding and the variety of <b>coding</b> <b>method</b> and has researched many applications technologies of this <b>coding</b> <b>method.</b> In addition, the efficiency of universal combinatorial coding is analyzed theoretically.

5000|$|The {{relation}} between the abstract machine and the refinement in B method in a B project seems like the Entity-Architecture relation in a VHDL project. In BHDL, from an enriched VHDL notation, the main structure is captured and communicated to the main formal model {{in order to prove}} the consistency of the structure and the coherence in relation to the abstract architecture and with the other components of the system.From the graphical tool, VGUI, the main structure of the system is created. Then, two different notations are generated VHDL and B. The produced B <b>method</b> <b>code</b> contains the main features of VHDL one.

If a company had 10,000 customers, a person {{attempting}} to [...] "guess" [...] a card number {{would have a}} good chance of doing so correctly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries for a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough for people to do manually, computers made the task far easier. [...] "Code hack" [...] programs were developed for computers with modems. The modems would dial the long distance access number, enter a random calling card number (of the proper number of digits), and attempt to complete a call to a computer bulletin board system (BBS). If the computer connected successfully to the BBS, it proved that it had found a working card number, and it saved that number to disk. If it did not connect to the BBS in a specified amount of time (usually 30 or 60 seconds), it would hang up and try a different code. Using this <b>method,</b> <b>code</b> hacking programs would turn up hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of working calling card numbers per day. These would subsequently be shared amongst fellow phreakers.|$|E

40|$|Panel <b>method</b> <b>code</b> ANTARES was {{developed}} to compute wall interference corrections in a rectangular wind tunnel. The code uses point doublets to represent blockage effects and line doublets to represent lifting effects of a wind tunnel model. Subsonic compressibility effects are modeled by applying the Prandtl-Glauert transformation. The closed wall, open jet, or perforated wall boundary condition may be assigned to a wall panel centroid. The tunnel walls can be represented by using up to 8000 panels. The accuracy of panel <b>method</b> <b>code</b> ANTARES was successfully investigated by comparing solutions for the closed wall and open jet boundary condition with corresponding Method of Images solutions. Fourier transform solutions of a two-dimensional wind tunnel flow field were used to check {{the application of the}} perforated wall boundary condition.
