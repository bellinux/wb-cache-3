It is shown that the aircraft response to soil moisture is optimum at C-band frequencies and incidence angles of 10 - 20 deg. confirming previous truck-radar results. Like-polarization radar response is unaffected by vegetation but is dependent on row-tillage patterns; cross-polarization response also is unaffected by vegetation but is approximately independent of tillage patterns.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{the problem}} of {{computing}} an optimal heat input in Luikov's heat and mass transfer problem is detailed and analyzed. The main objective is {{the establishment of an}} optimal time-dependent heat flux profile with the goal of maximizing the temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of some parameters to this excitation in a drying process. Such maximization makes the estimation of the desired parameters possible, easier, and with limited uncertainty intervals. It also helps to reduce the linearity dependence between the parameters of interest and the number of temperature and moisture sensors used. The estimation of the optimal heat input is obtained with Uzawa's algorithm, while the estimation of parameters is performed with Levenberg-Marquardt's method of minimization of the ordinary least-square criterion. The six dimensionless parameters characterizing Luikov's equations are estimated successfully with this optimal heat flux profile, which also helps {{to reduce the number of}} both temperature and moisture sensors needed in the estimation procedure. By doing so, the objective of estimating simultaneously the six parameters which appear in the formulation of Luikov's physical problem is reached by using a limited transient temperature and/or moisture measurements taken anywhere in the drying medium...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} response patterns and mechanisms of soil respiration to precipitation increases in subtropical regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Field plots in three typical forests [i. e. pine forest (PF), broadleaf forest (BF), and pine and broadleaf mixed forest (MF) ] in subtropical China were exposed under either Double Precipitation (DP) treatment or Ambient Precipitation (AP). Soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil microbial biomass and fine root biomass were measured over three years. We tested whether precipitation treatments influenced the relationship of soil respiration rate (R) with soil temperature (T) and soil moisture (M) using R = (a+cM) exp(bT), where a is a parameter related to basal soil respiration; b and c are parameters related to the soil temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of soil respiration, respectively. We found that the DP treatment only slightly increased mean annual soil respiration in the PF (15. 4 %) and did not significantly change soil respiration in the MF and the BF. In the BF, the increase in soil respiration was related to the enhancements of both soil fine root biomass and microbial biomass. The DP treatment did not change model parameters, but increased soil moisture, resulting in a slight increase in soil respiration. In the MF and the BF, the DP treatment decreased soil temperature sensitivity b but increased basal soil respiration a, resulting in no significant change in soil respiration...|$|R

The NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Oce (GMAO) has developed an exact adjoint of the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis scheme developed at the National Centers for En-vironmental Prediction (NCEP). The development approach is unique in that the adjoint is derived from a line-by-line tangent linear version of the GSI. Availability of the tangent linear scheme provides an explicit means of assessing not only the delity of the adjoint, but also the eects of nonlinear processes in the GSI itself. In this paper, we discuss {{the development of the}} tangent linear and adjoint versions of the GSI and show observation sensitivity results for a near-operational version of the system. Results indicate that the GSI adjoint provides accurate assessments of the sensitivi-ties with respect to observations of wind, temperature, satellite radiances and, to a lesser extent, <b>moisture.</b> <b>Sensitivities</b> with respect to ozone observations are quite linear for the ozone elds themselves, but highly nonlinear for other variables. The sensitivity informa-tion provided by the adjoint is used to estimate the contribution, or impact, of various observing systems on locally dened response functions based on the analyzed increments of temperature and zonal wind. It is shown, for example, that satellite radiances have the largest impact of all observing systems on the temperature increments over the eastern North Pacic, while conventional observations from rawinsondes and aircraft dominate the impact on the zonal wind increments over the continental US. The observation impact calculations also provide an additional means of validating the observation sensitivities produced by the GSI adjoint. 1...|$|R

In this study, we analyzed soil organic carbon (SOC) changes from 11 Earth system models (ESMs) contributing simulations to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5). We used a reduced complexity model based on temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivities</b> to analyze the drivers of SOC change for the historical and high radiative forcing (RCP 8. 5) scenarios between 1850 and 2100. ESM estimates of SOC changed over the 21 st century (2090 – 2099 minus 1997 – 2006) ranging from a loss of 72 Pg C to a gain of 253 Pg C with a multi-model mean gain of 65 Pg C. Many ESMs simulated large changes in high-latitude SOC that ranged from losses of 37 Pg C to gains of 146 Pg C with a multi-model mean gain of 39 Pg C across tundra and boreal biomes. All ESMs showed cumulative increases in global NPP (11 to 59 %) and decreases in SOC turnover times (15 to 28 %) over the 21 st century. Most of the model-to-model variation in SOC change was explained by initial SOC stocks combined with the relative changes in soil inputs and decomposition rates (R 2 = 0. 89, p < 0. 01). Between models, increases in decomposition rate were well explained by a combination of initial decomposition rate, ESM-specific Q 10 -factors, and changes in soil temperature (R 2 = 0. 80, p < 0. 01). All SOC changes depended on sustained increases in NPP with global change (primarily driven by increasing CO 2). Many ESMs simulated large accumulations of SOC in high-latitude biomes that are not consistent with empirical studies. Most ESMs poorly represented permafrost dynamics and omitted potential constraints on SOC storage, such as priming effects, nutrient availability, mineral surface stabilization, and aggregate formation. Future models that represent these constraints are likely to estimate smaller increases in SOC storage over the 21 st century...|$|R

We measured the soil CO 2 efflux (R s) at a high-elevation (3260  m) mixed forest and a lower-elevation (2460  m) broadleaf forest in Bhutan, eastern Himalayas, during 2015. Trenching was applied to estimate the contribution of autotrophic (R a) and heterotrophic (R h) soil respiration. The temperature (Q 10) and the <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of R h were determined under controlled laboratory conditions and were used to model R h in the field. The higher-elevation mixed forest had a higher standing tree stock, reflected in higher soil C stocks and basal soil respiration. Annual R s was similar between the two forest sites (14. 5  ±  1. 2  t C ha − 1 for broadleaf; 12. 8  ±  1. 0  t C ha − 1 for mixed). Modelled annual contribution of R h was [*]∼[*]  65  % of R s at both sites with a higher heterotrophic contribution during winter and lower contribution during the monsoon season. R h, estimated from trenching, was {{in the range of}} modelled R h but showed higher temporal variability. The measured temperature sensitivity of R h was similar at the mixed and broadleaf forest sites (Q 10 2. 2 – 2. 3) under intermediate soil moisture but decreased (Q 10 1. 5 at both sites) in dry soil. R s closely followed the annual course of field soil temperature at both sites. Covariation between soil temperature and moisture (cold dry winters and warm wet summers) was likely the main cause for this close relationship. Under the prevailing weather conditions, a simple temperature-driven model was able to explain more than 90  % of the temporal variation in R s.

A diagram shows the difference (g/kg) between the GPS/MET zonal mean specific humidity and that for June-August derived from 1963 - 1973 radiosondes. Although the observing period is short, GPS and ECMWF results both indicate a significantly wetter boundary layer at most latitudes consistent with decadal trends observed in radiosonde data. GPS/MET results exhibit higher tropical convective available potential energy (CAPE), suggesting a more vigorous tropical Hadley circulation. Drier, free troposphere air in the descending branches of the Hadley circulation {{is due in part to}} a moist radiosonde bias but may also reflect some negative moisture feedback. Using 1992 - 1997 ground GPS observations and recent advancements in GPS technology, we removed an apparent altimetric drift (- 1. 2 +/- 0. 4 mm/yr) due to columnar water vapor from the Topography (Ocean) Experiment (TOPEX) microwave radiometer, which brought the TOPEX mean sea level change estimates into better agreement with historical tide gauge records, suggesting global mean sea level is rising at a rate of 1. 5 - 2. 0 mm/yr. We can also discern a statistically significant increase of 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 kg/square m/yr in mean columnar water vapor over the ocean from 1992 - 1997. Optimal fingerprinting can be used for the detection and attribution of tropospheric warming due to an anthropogenic greenhouse. Optimal fingerprinting distinguishes between different types of signals according to their spatial and temporal patterns, while minimizing the influence of natural climate variability. S.

The failure mechanism is restricted to the potential delamination between mold compound and leadframe. In addition, such an equivalency requires the activation energy of molding compound for moisture diffusion {{in the range of}} 0. 4 - 0. 48 eV. This paper introduces a new method t...|$|E
40|$|Moisture-induced damage within {{hot mix asphalt}} {{concrete}} has been a national problem. Although numerous laboratory tests have been developed {{over the last several}} decades, the premature failure of hot mix {{asphalt concrete}} is still prevalent. The failure of hot mix asphalt concrete has always been linked to the failure of test method in consistently and accurately predicting <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> ^ The factor most commonly disregarded is the acceptance criteria of the placed properties of hot mix asphalt concrete. To account for production and construction variability, state highway agencies typically allow a range of hot mix asphalt concrete properties to be acceptable. For instance, 7 percent of voids in total mix are specified but contractor is allowed to place hot mix asphalt concrete within 2. 7 to 9. 9 percent voids in total mix. An increase in voids in total mix to 9. 9 percent may increase <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of hot mix asphalt concrete. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify the influence of acceptance criterion in terms of voids in total mix on <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Similarly, state highway agencies allow variations in binder content and gradation. Therefore, the influence of binder content and gradation at higher voids in total mix was also evaluated. ^ To achieve objectives of this study, three different aggregate types with two different binders were evaluated. The <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of these mixes was evaluated using two commonly used test methods: Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device and AASHTO T- 283. ^ The test results from Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device and AASHTO T- 283 suggest that the <b>moisture</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of hot mix asphalt concrete depends on the acceptance criteria especially voids in total mix. ...|$|E
40|$|Directional {{reflectance}} {{measurements were}} made over a semi-desert gramma grassland {{at various times}} of the growing season. View angle measurements from + 40 to - 40 degrees were made at various solar zenith angles and soil <b>moisture</b> conditions. The <b>sensitivity</b> of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to bidirectional measurements was assessed for purposes of improving remote temporal monitoring of vegetation dynamics. The SAVI view angle response {{was found to be}} symmetric about nadir while the NDVI response was strongly anisotropic. This enabled the view angle behavior of the SAVI to be normalized with a cosine function. In contrast to the NDVI, the SAVI was able to minimize soil moisture and shadow influences for all measurement conditions...|$|R
40|$|A new {{physically}} based disaggregation {{method is}} developed {{to improve the}} spatial resolution of the surface soil moisture extracted from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data. The approach combines the 40 -km resolutionSMOSmultiangular brightness temperatures and 1 -km resolution auxiliary data composed of visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing data and all the surface variables involved in the modeling of land surface–atmosphere interaction available at this scale (soil texture, atmospheric forcing, etc.). The method successively estimates a relative spatial distribution of soil moisture with fine-scale auxiliary data, and normalizes this distribution at SMOS resolution with SMOS data. The main assumption relies {{on the relationship between}} the radiometric soil temperature inverted from the thermal infrared and the microwave soil moisture. Based on synthetic data generated with a land surface model, it is shown that the radiometric soil temperature {{can be used as a}} tracer of the spatial variability of the 0 – 5 cm soil <b>moisture.</b> A <b>sensitivity</b> analysis shows that the algorithm remains stable for big uncertainties in auxiliary data and that the uncertainty in SMOS observation seems to be the limiting factor. Finally, a simple application to the SGP 97 /AVHRR data illustrates the usefulness of the approach...|$|R
40|$|The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) {{provides}} intermediate-scale (~ 700 m diameter circle, 35 ha) area-average {{soil moisture}} measurements. A CRNP, whose footprint covers the entire T. W. Daniel Experimental Forest instrumented site, {{was installed in}} August 2011 {{as part of the}} COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS). Independent soil moisture measurements reveal CRNP is more sensitive to near surface soil moisture (0 - 10 cm) than deeper layers. The CRNP response to summer-time soil moisture was compared with the TWDEF soil moisture measurement network containing 108 time-domain transmission (TDT) water content sensors. We also employed the Hydrus- 1 D model to numerically simulate soil moisture including the top 10 cm of the soil moisture profile. Comparison of these two estimates with CRNP revealed that the spatially averaged point measurements of soil moisture were less well correlated with cosmic-ray neutron counts during rainfall events that wetted the near-surface, not reaching the sensors at 10 cm. Simulations of near-surface soil moisture using Hydrus- 1 D showed improved correlation with CRNP response to precipitation events that trigger increased surface soil <b>moisture.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> to near-surface soil moisture makes CRNP a powerful indicator of soil surface water status and could potentially be used to interpret soil water fluxes at this intermediate scale...|$|R
