And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to injure.

500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Curt accompanies Steve, last year's {{high school}} student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop. In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a {{beautiful}} blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees {{en route to the}} dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say [...] "I love you" [...] before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing. It turns out to be [...] "The Blonde" [...] who says she knows him and <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> see him cruising the coming night. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided {{to go to college and}} will be leaving that morning.|$|E
6000|$|Ay, and if <b>she</b> spoke, <b>maybe</b> [...] <b>She</b> <b>would</b> answer, {{like the}} Son, [...] "What is now 'twixt thee and me?" [...] Dreadful answer! better none.

2500|$|In early April 2006, Harris {{told the}} Tampa Tribune {{that some of}} her ex-campaign staffers and the {{national}} Republican party were deliberately sabotaging her campaign by [...] "putting knives in her back" [...] and had warned {{her that if she}} did not back out of the campaign, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> get an [...] "April surprise". Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said [...] "They were all good professionals...There was no backstabbing. It's insulting that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> even say that. If she wants to know what went wrong with the campaign, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> needs to take a good look in the mirror." ...|$|R

6000|$|Cornelia now {{thought she}} was really angry {{with him for the}} first time since their marriage. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> not speak at once, but when she did speak, it was to say, [...] "No, let her keep it. I know Charmian made her buy it and I wouldn't like to take it from her. She has so much {{imagination}} that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> can see some meaning in it and it will always be such a pleasure to her to explain it even if she can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{occurred}} to me that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to hear {{a few of them}} there and then, but before I had got well started a hollow Society man came up and suggested supper, and she was compelled to leave me. As she disappeared, however, in the throng, she looked back over her shoulder with a glance half pathetic, half comic, that I understood. It said, [...] "Pity me, I've got to be bored by this vapid, shallow creature," [...] and I did.|$|E

Mr. Davenant has given me a letter for Miss Conyers, telling her all about it.

We {{had gone}} on the May Day for a round voyage of seven days, but a {{hogshead}} got loose and started one of our plates, so {{that we had to}} put back into port for twelve hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and hoping that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be glad to see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath.|$|E

6000|$|In {{consideration}} of this, {{and of the}} agitation and unsettled state that had put the last week out of all common rules, she announced on Monday morning that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> excuse all the fines, and that all the children should have their allowance unbroken. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> was moved to this by the suspicion that these four sixpences and three threepennies would make up the fund {{to the price of}} a [...] "reasonable pig;" [...] and she thought it time that David's perseverance should be rewarded, and room made in his mind for something beyond swine and halfpence.|$|R

60|$|She {{took the}} little local packet at Cairo, {{and now she}} was on the homestretch. Time had worn away her {{bitterness}} against her son, and she was able to think of him with serenity. She put the vile side of him out of her mind, and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of kindness to her. She gilded and otherwise decorated these, and made them very pleasant to contemplate. She began to long to see him. She would go and fawn upon him slavelike--for this would have to be her attitude, of course--and <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find that time had modified him, and that he would be glad to see his long-forgotten old nurse and treat her gently. That would be lovely; that would make her forget her woes and her poverty.|$|E
60|$|A young couple, I {{once heard}} of, went for their honeymoon to Scotland. The poor girl {{did not know}} he was a golfer (he had wooed and won her {{during a period of}} idleness {{enforced}} by a sprained shoulder), or <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have avoided Scotland. The idea they started with was that of a tour. The second day the man went out for a stroll by himself. At dinner-time he observed, with a far-away look in his eyes, that it seemed a pretty spot they had struck, and suggested their staying there another day. The next morning after breakfast he borrowed a club from the hotel porter, and remarked that he would take a walk while she finished doing her hair. He said it amused him, swinging a club while he walked. He returned in time for lunch and seemed moody all the afternoon. He said the air suited him, and urged that they should linger yet another day.|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{decided that}} he could be {{independent}} of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be wanting to [...] "make up." [...] Well, let her--she should see {{that he could be}} as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only [...] "set him up" [...] the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity: ...|$|E
50|$|If {{one finds}} oneself believing all three propositions of an {{inconsistent}} triad, then (in {{order to be}} rational) one must give up or modify {{at least one of}} those beliefs.

6000|$|It was the cow that woke me {{the first}} morning. I {{did not know it}} was our cow--not at the time. I didn't know we had a cow. I looked at my watch; it was half-past two. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go to sleep again, but her idea was that the day had begun. I went to the window, the moon was at the full. She was {{standing}} by the gate, her head inside the garden; I took it her anxiety was lest we might miss any of it. Her neck was stretched out straight, her eyes towards the sky; which gave to her the appearance of a long-eared alligator. I have never {{had much to do with}} cows. I don't know how you talk to them. I told her to [...] "be quiet," [...] and to [...] "lie down"; and made pretence to throw a boot at her. It seemed to cheer her, having an audience; she added half a dozen extra notes. I never knew before a cow had so much in her. There is a thing one sometimes meets with in the suburbs--or one used to; I do not know whether it is still extant, but when I was a boy it was quite common. It has a hurdy-gurdy fixed to its waist and a drum strapped on behind, a row of pipes hanging from its face, and bells and clappers from most of its other joints. It plays them all at once, and smiles. This cow reminded me of it-- with organ effects added. She didn't smile; there was that to be said in her favour.|$|E

[...] She spoke of this command to another Sister, {{who had come to}} visit. Barbara said she {{did not know how to}} write. The visiting Sister told her to try; <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be able to write down what was necessary. Barbara wrote down single letters and syllables, as best she could.|$|E

[...] On the character kissing Hive moments before her death, Whedon said, [...] "Is it creepy that she’s basically kissing her uncle? Yes. But she’s caught up. This is the most powerful thing that she’s been taught to worship her whole life that’s paying attention to her.

5000|$|In 1832, {{he became}} {{president}} of the Howland & Aspinwall merchant firm, which had been founded by his cousin and expanded trade to South America, China, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the East and West Indies. Howland & Aspinwall owned some of the most famous clipper ships ever built. In 1845, while the firm owned the Ann McKim which was regarded as the fastest ship afloat, it built the Rainbow, which was even faster. The Rainbow was the high-tech racehorse of its day, and is considered to be the first of the extreme clippers. Instead of the bluff bow that was customary on ships up until that time, the Rainbow had a sharp bow, prompting on-lookers to joke that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> sail better backwards. The next year, Howland & Aspinwall had the Sea Witch built, which set a speed record from China to New York which still stands.|$|E
