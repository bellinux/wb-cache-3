5|$|In 2016, Boston was {{estimated}} to have 667,137 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq <b>mile,</b> <b>or</b> 5,344/km2) living in 272,481 housing units— an 8% population increase over 2010. The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents. Some 1.2million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, {{and as many as}} 2million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914 he {{travelled}} to France as {{a mechanic}} with 3 Squadron after war was declared, which followed the German invasion of Belgium. It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer. After stopping at Amiens for several days, the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions. 3 Squadron offered {{support to the}} British Army at the Battle of Mons in Belgium. That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August. On 25 August the British began their retreat, south-west, toward Paris. 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds, often delaying departure until the enemy was only a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> two behind. Eventually they settled at Melun, south of Paris. In the autumn, McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions as the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the Marne and First Battle of the Aisne. McCudden flew these missions with a rifle since aircraft lacked any fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 July the Japanese {{attacked}} the main position Kokoda. There were only 80 men from 'B' Company left at that time, and armed only with small arms and a few Bren light machine guns, they were {{no match for the}} assaulting Japanese. Casualties on both sides were high as the Australians resorted to hand-to-hand combat, and the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown in to take over the battalion following Templeton's death, was killed while organising the withdrawal. It became clear that Kokoda was lost and the following morning, under the cover of a dense mist, with the PIB's commanding officer, Major William Watson, assuming temporary command, the survivors abandoned the position and fell back towards the village of Deniki, a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> so back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava.|$|E

[...] There are five membership tiers: Altitude Prestige 25K (25,000 Status <b>Miles</b> <b>or</b> 25 Status Segments), Altitude Elite 35K (35,000 Status <b>Miles</b> <b>or</b> 35 Status Segments), Altitude Elite 50K (50,000 Status <b>Miles</b> <b>or</b> 50 Status Segments), Altitude Elite 75K (75,000 Status <b>Miles</b> <b>or</b> 75 Status Segments), and Altitude Super Elite 100K (100,000 Status <b>Miles</b> <b>or</b> 95 Status Segments). Qualified Altitude Prestige 25K and Altitude Elite 35K are entitled to Star Alliance Silver Status, while members {{of the other three}} tiers are entitled to Star Alliance Gold Status.|$|R
5|$|More serious {{retaliation}} {{against the}} Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and Henri de Louboëy. The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built {{near the site}} of the Grand Village of the Natchez, a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> so east of Fort Rosalie, which had been rebuilt. They killed about 80 men and captured 18 women, and released some French women who had been captured during the massacre of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from Tunica and Choctaw warriors. The Choctaw attacked the Natchez without the French, killing 100 and capturing women and children. This ruined the element of surprise for the French as the Natchez had already scattered. At first, the Natchez were well prepared for French retaliatory strikes, having stocked up several cannons as well as the firearms that they had used in the massacre two months earlier. The Natchez captured by the Choctaw and Tunica allies of the French were given over to the governor and sold into slavery, and some were publicly tortured to death in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The AI sets {{added to}} Beaufighters {{were the first}} to be mass-produced. The {{operating}} frequency was 190 to 195 MHz with a wavelength of 1.5 metres. The equipment consisted of a receiver, transmitter, control panel, modulator, indicator unit and a system of fixed dipole aerials. On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of azimuth aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes. They displayed elevation and azimuth bearing. The set had a range-limitation of four miles (circa 20,000 feet). The minimum range of detection was usually around 400 feet. At closer ranges the target merged with the transmission pulse and was obscured. At altitudes below 1,000 feet, the returns from ground objects would swamp the tubes. Operators like Rawnsley were left to do a fair amount of guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the azimuth plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed. At least the GCI could bring the Beaufighter well within range of the target, usually a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> so behind the bomber.|$|E
5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in order to deal with breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> so to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous night would contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug around the perimeter of the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged cross-hatched to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E
60|$|The fleet {{had drifted}} three <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> {{more from the}} land. The battle-ship Massachusetts, the {{protected}} cruiser New Orleans, and Commodore Watson’s flag-ship, the cruiser Newark, were absent, coaling fifty <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> more away.|$|R

5|$|Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69) is a {{business}} loop running through downtown Port Huron. The first <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> so (1.7km) of BL I-69 runs southeasterly from I-69 at the interchange where it meets I-94. The business loop follows a four-lane freeway until the intersection with 32nd Street. A bit further east, it turns due east–west into a one-way pair of three-lane surface streets, eastbound along Oak Street and westbound along Griswold Street, that run through residential areas on the west and south sides of Port Huron. East of 23rd Street. {{the two halves of}} BL I-69 narrow to two lanes each. In downtown Port Huron, BL I-69 turns northerly running concurrently with BL I-94 on four-lane Military Avenue parallel to the St. Clair River. North of the crossing of the Black River, BL I-69/BL I-94 continues northward on Huron Avenue through downtown. At the intersection with Glenwood Avenue, the business loop turns northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue through residential areas {{on the north side of}} the city. The street is five lanes, two in each direction with a center turn lane, and passes under the I-94/I-69 freeway at the toll and customs plazas for the Blue Water Bridge; north of the freeway, there is a ramp to connect to the eastbound direction of the freeway and the bridge. The business loop continues along Pine Grove Avenue, intersecting the southern end of M-25 at Hancock Street. At that intersection, the business loop turns westward for a block. It then turns south along the connector to terminate at westbound I-94/I-69 west of the Blue Water Bridge toll plaza.|$|E

25|$|They {{were passing}} {{close to the}} Albanian coast in what they {{considered}} to be a mine-free zone with Mauritius leading and Saumarez following closely. Leander was about one and two-thirds of a nautical <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> three kilometres away accompanied by Volage. Near the bay of Saranda, just prior to 3 p.m., the destroyer Saumarez struck a mine and was heavily damaged. The destroyer Volage was ordered to tow the Saumarez south to a Corfu harbour.|$|E

25|$|Thus it {{happened}} that Redoubt No. 1, the last bastion on the Confederate left flank, was captured by troops coming from the north, south, and west. Stewart's corps had been wrecked by the day's fighting and retreated to {{a new line of}} defense a <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> two to the south.
