25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that effective teaching {{must be based}} on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E
25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E

500|$|... "People {{talk about}} how horrible {{it is to be}} brought up Catholic, and it's all true. The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> was that there was no sense of proportion.

That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E

[...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure.

Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race.

500|$|During the summer, Amondson campaigned in Louisiana {{and walked}} Bourbon Street dressed as the Grim Reaper {{in protest of}} alcohol. While in New Orleans, he filmed a {{documentary}} with his three sons. In interviews, Amondson took stands on issues other than alcohol. He declared support for the War in Iraq and tougher immigration laws, and advocated limits on divorce, an increased {{role of religion in}} schools and a decrease in government welfare programs. In an August interview with Weekend America, he explained his platform, [...] "e want to have protected borders and keep our gun rights and a lot of conservative things, but the <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> is help America realize that 95 percent of violent crime is connected with alcohol." ...|$|E

500|$|Coppola {{wanted a}} minimalist {{look for the}} film, {{especially}} after the mixed reactions to her richly costumed Marie Antoinette. The overall effect was to be [...] "sweet and genuine but without being sappy." [...] For the visual style she discussed Bruce Weber's Hollywood portraits and Helmut Newton's photographs of models at the Chateau Marmont, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), a film by Chantal Akerman about the routine of a Belgian housewife, with Harris Savides, the cinematographer. He said, [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> was {{to tell the story}} really simply and let it play out in long beats and have the audience discover the moment." [...] Coppola used the lenses that her father had used to film Rumble Fish (1983) in an effort to give the film a more period look, although it is set in the present.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{opened with}} a musical number which parodied the song [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] from Mamma Mia! The Movie. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. Awardees received a gold spray-painted raspberry worth $4.97. The Love Guru received three awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay. Worst Picture was the last award given out at the ceremony. John Wilson {{did not agree with}} the voters' determination on The Love Guru, and after viewing the film again in preparation for the ceremony, said to the Associated Press: [...] "A couple of things he did got me to laugh, and these days, two laughs in a comedy is a high ratio." [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> wrong with it is no one said to Myers that it wasn't funny. He managed to offend the entire Indian population and his investors," [...] said Wilson in a statement in The Guardian. Wilson shredded a copy of The Love Guru at the awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Gay genre films remain rare, {{and science}} fiction films' {{inclusion}} of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, {{such as the}} [...] "stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual" [...] minor character in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day, a film whose main theme {{has been described as}} being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} film's director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but it isn't the <b>main</b> <b>thing,</b> although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, Cloud Atlas, featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.|$|E

500|$|Griffith {{continued}} to have faith in Neuer during the exhibition season, and said he could potentially be [...] "one of the greatest ever in the twirling line." [...] Instead of working on his control during that time, which was considered the <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> he needed to work on, he practiced throwing the knuckleball and spitball. Griffith encouraged him to do so, believing that developing these trick pitches {{would allow him to}} become a great pitcher, and as a result, he practiced these pitches until, according to one sportswriter, [...] "he was so wild he couldn’t hit the grand stand." [...] In one exhibition game against Atlanta, he appeared in relief of Jack Chesbro, and allowed four runs in less than an inning due to his lack of control. His pitching {{continued to}} get worse, {{and by the end of}} spring training he was sent to the Newark Indians of the Eastern League. He never returned to the major leagues, becoming the only person to throw a shutout in both his major league debut and his final game.|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{structure}} of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: [...] "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the <b>main</b> <b>thing.</b> The camera is there to photograph the actors". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, [...] "Simplicity is best... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant... The camera should not intrude." [...] This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being [...] "old fashioned", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent {{would not be enough}} to remain funny on screen if he did not have an [...] "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".|$|E

500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>thing,</b> for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe." ...|$|E
500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is the <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> that I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of}} a big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
500|$|Damien Leith stated how {{his debut}} studio album wanted to pan out: [...] "I didn't {{really want to}} do anybody else's songs... I just wanted this album to be mine". Immediately after Australian Idol concluded, he {{convinced}} the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album. The protocol was that the Australian Idol winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months. Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two Idol winners, Casey Donovan and Kate DeAraugo, so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, [...] "I suppose the <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that's something that hasn't really been promoted in the past." [...] He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was. He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.|$|E
