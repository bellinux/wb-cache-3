2500|$|BisphenolA is leached {{from the}} lining of food and {{beverage}} cans where it is used as an ingredient in the plastic used to protect the food from {{direct contact with the}} can. It is especially likely to leach from plastics when they are cleaned with harsh detergents or when they contain acidic or high-temperature liquids. BPA is used to form epoxy resin coating of water pipes; in older buildings, such resin coatings are used to avoid replacement of deteriorating pipes. [...] In the workplace, while handling and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>products</b> which contain BPA, inhalation and dermal exposures are the most probable routes. [...] There are many uses of BPA for which related potential exposures have not been fully assessed including digital media, electrical and electronic equipment, automobiles, sports safety equipment, electrical laminates for printed circuit boards, composites, paints, and adhesives. In addition to being present in many products that people use on a daily basis, BPA has the ability to bioaccumulate, especially in water bodies. In one review, it was seen that although BPA is biodegradable, it is still detected after wastewater treatment in many waterways at concentrations of approximately 1ug/L. This study also looked at other pathways where BPA could potentially bioaccumulate and found [...] "low-moderate potential...in microorganisms, algae, invertebrates, and fish in the environment" [...] suggesting that some environmental exposures less likely.|$|E

40|$|To compete {{successfully}} in the market place, organizations optimally utilize their in-puts and benchmark their key inputs and outputs against other successful firms.

In this research, we investigate a) if these two inputs systematically vary across consumer <b>product</b> and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>product</b> organizations, and b) if these two factors {{have an impact on}} firm’s performance. We find that consumer product organizations have higher advertising intensity than <b>manufacturing</b> <b>product</b> organizations. However, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>product</b> organizations have higher R&D intensity than consumer product organizations. Find-ings of this research also reveal that advertising intensity and R&D intensity are positively related to firm profit margins.

40|$|The present paper {{makes an}} attempt to examine {{theoretically}} the impact of emigration of skilled labour from developing countries {{on the level of}} welfare of the non-migrants and the level of urban unemployment of unskilled labour in a three sector Harris-Todaro model. The analysis suggests that in a reasonable production structure for a developing economy a brain drain of skilled labour raises urban unemployment of unskilled labour. The paper also shows that an emigration of skilled labour may raise the welfare of the non-migrants in a tariff-distorted economy if it imports the specialized <b>manufacturing</b> <b>product</b> or the labour-intensive good. However, if the economy imports the traditional <b>manufacturing</b> <b>product,</b> the welfare of the non-emigrating workers is likely to deteriorate.
