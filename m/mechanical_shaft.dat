2500|$|In {{electric}} power generation a combined cycle is an assembly of heat engines that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into mechanical energy, which in turn usually drives electrical generators. The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), {{the temperature of the}} working fluid engine is still high enough that a second subsequent heat engine may extract energy from the waste heat that the first engine produced. [...] By combining these multiple streams of work upon a single <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaft</b> turning an electric generator, the overall net efficiency of the system may be increased by 50–60%. [...] That is, from an overall efficiency of say 34% (in a single cycle) to possibly an overall efficiency of 51% (in a mechanical combination of two cycles) in net Carnot thermodynamic efficiency. [...] This can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates (usually less than 50%). [...] In an ordinary (non combined cycle) heat engine the remaining heat (e.g., hot exhaust fumes) from combustion is generally wasted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Torsional {{vibrations}} {{occur in}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>shafts</b> of large turbo-generating sets in power plants by subsynchronous oscillations and subsynchronous reso-nances, respectively [1]. In Addition any load causing active power fluctuations with eigenfrequencies of the generator shaft assembly can excite critical torsional vi-brations in the shaft systems [2] [3]. It {{is impossible to}} obtain a desirable damping of these torsional vibrations {{by means of a}} mechanical method. However, by using a Par-allel Connected Damper Circuit (PCDC), an electrical method can be used to implement an active damping. Computer simulations showed the principal suitability of the PCDC for suppressing torsional vibrations. Neverthe-less, a test of the PCDC at a real system is still outstanding. In order to get more significant information of the per-formance of the PCDC a downscaled turbo-generating set is build up at the moment. This paper presents the whole experimental setup consisting of the mechanical compo-nents, the generator and drive, the measurement, the control and the damper system...|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} steering system, a feedback torque {{is produced}} from the contact between tire and road surface and its flows through <b>mechanical</b> column <b>shaft</b> directly to driver. This allows {{the driver to}} sense the steering feel during driving. However, in steer by wire (SBW) system, {{the elimination of the}} <b>mechanical</b> column <b>shaft</b> requires the system to generate the feedback torque which should produce similar performance with conventional steering system. Therefore, this paper proposes a control algorithm to create the force feedback torque for SBW system. The direct current measurement approach is used to estimate torque at the steering wheel and front axle motor as elements to the feedback torque, while, adding the compensation torque for a realistic feedback torque. The gain scheduling with a linear quadratic regulator controller is used to control the feedback torque and to vary a steering feel gain. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a real-time hardware in the loop (HIL) methodology is developed using Matlab XPC target toolbox. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate the feedback torque similar to EPS steering system. Furthermore, the compensation torque is able to improve the steering feel and stabilize the system...|$|R
