25|$|In their location, {{materials}} and design, the Caloundra Lighthouses (constructed in 1896 and 1968) {{are important in}} demonstrating aspects {{of the evolution of}} <b>marine</b> <b>navigation</b> along the Queensland coast. The first Caloundra Head Lighthouse (1896) marked the entrance to the North West Channel in Moreton Bay, which proved to be the safest, most reliable and consequently the most used entry channel to the Port of Brisbane, Queensland's premier port since the 1840s. It {{played an important role in}} Queensland <b>marine</b> <b>navigation</b> for over 70 years. The second lighthouse (1868) marked the entrance to the main channel for only a decade, but remains important in illustrating the evolution of lighthouse form and function in Queensland.

25|$|In 1945, {{the company}} {{expanded}} its electronics capability through acquisitions {{that included the}} Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial <b>marine</b> <b>navigation</b> and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it {{changed its name to}} Raytheon Company.|$|E
500|$|Bright {{stars were}} {{important}} to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of Fiji at 17°S and thus passes directly over the islands each night. Sirius served as {{the body of a}} [...] "Great Bird" [...] constellation called Manu, with Canopus as the southern wingtip and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the Māori, whose name Takurua described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the winter solstice was marked by celebration in Hawaii, where it was known as Ka'ulua, [...] "Queen of Heaven". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including Tau-ua in the Marquesas Islands, Rehua in New Zealand, and Ta'urua-fau-papa [...] "Festivity of original high chiefs" [...] and Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai [...] "Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies" [...] in Tahiti. The Hawaiian people had many names for Sirius, including Aa ("glowing"), Hoku-kauopae, Kau-ano-meha (also Kaulanomeha), [...] "Standing-alone-and-sacred", Hiki-kauelia or Hiki-kauilia (the navigational name), Hiki-kau-lono-meha ("star of solitary Lono", the astrological name), Kaulua (also Kaulua-ihai-mohai, [...] "flower of the heavens"), Hiki-kauelia, Hoku-hoo-kele-waa ("star which causes the canoe to sail", a <b>marine</b> <b>navigation</b> name), and Kaulua-lena ("yellow star"). The people of the Society Islands called Sirius variously Taurua-fau-papa, Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha, and Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai. Other names for Sirius included Palolo-mua (Futuna), Mere (Mangaia), Apura (Manihiki), Taku-ua (Marquesas Islands), and Tokiva (Pukapuka). In the cosmology of the Tuamotus, Sirius had various names, including Takurua-te-upuupu, Te Kaha ("coconut fibre"), Te Upuupu, Taranga, and Vero-ma-torutoru ("flaming and diminishing").|$|E

The kernel and periphery of the modern navigation and hydrographical terminology are determined in the given article. An attempt to find out semantic and word-formation peculiarities of the navigation and hydrographical terminology is made in the article. The classification signs of the lexical groups on denotation of the names of sea charts, <b>marine</b> dangers to <b>navigation,</b> navigational warnings and signals are analyzed in the article.

2500|$|The global or world ocean, as the {{interconnected}} {{system of the}} Earth's oceanic (or marine) waters that comprise {{the bulk of the}} hydrosphere, is a classic global commons. [...] It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the continents and various oceanographic features. [...] In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays. [...] Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's water cycle from ocean waters. [...] The Law of the Sea is a body of public international law governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, mineral rights, and jurisdiction over coastal waters. [...] Maritime law, also called Admiralty law, is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, <b>marine</b> <b>navigation,</b> shipping, sailors, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea.

2500|$|Giovanni Cassini {{published}} {{a much more}} accurate ephemeris table in 1668 using his observations from the previous 16 years. Using this table, Cassini generated a more accurate map of France by observing eclipses of the Jovian satellites at various locations across the country. This showed that previous maps had depicted some shorelines as extending farther than they really did, which caused the apparent area of France to shrink, and led King Louis XIV to comment that [...] "he was losing more territory to his astronomers than to his enemies." [...] Eclipse timings of the Jovian moons {{would continue to be}} used to determine longitude for another hundred years for tasks such as surveying the Mason–Dixon line and geodesy measurements. Efforts were made to utilize this method for <b>marine</b> <b>navigation,</b> but it proved to be impossible to make the necessary observations with sufficient accuracy from the moving deck of a ship; it would not be until the invention of the marine chronometer in the mid-18th century that determining longitude at sea became practical.|$|E
60|$|In {{poor and}} {{backward}} societies, {{as in the}} East, and in Europe during the middle ages, extraordinary differences {{in the price of}} the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other, because the want of roads and canals, the imperfection of <b>marine</b> <b>navigation,</b> and the insecurity of communications generally, prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear. The things most liable to fluctuations in value, those directly influenced by the seasons, and especially food, were seldom carried to any great distances. In most years, accordingly, there was, in some part or other of any large country, a real dearth; while a deficiency at all considerable, extending to the whole world, is [now] a thing almost unknown. In modern times, therefore, there is only dearth, where there formerly would have been famine, and sufficiency everywhere when anciently there would have been scarcity in some places and superfluity in others.|$|E
