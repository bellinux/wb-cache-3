5|$|McGovern {{switched}} from Wesleyan Methodism to less fundamentalist regular Methodism. Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by the <b>minutiae</b> of his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, {{where he also}} worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the <b>minutiae</b> of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
5|$|William III's {{victory at}} the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (O.S.) forced JamesII to abandon his army and flee back to France. In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first {{independent}} command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him {{the significance of the}} <b>minutiae</b> of logistics, and the importance of cooperation and tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took charge in the field.|$|E

It can locate fingerprints using the singular from classification information. In addition, <b>minutia</b> structure {{can be used}} to save the time of matching <b>minutia</b> in a simple but effective way. Then, the matching of <b>minutia</b> is based on the changeable sized boundary box. At the same time, possible reference position is computed to make sure the algorithm more robust to nonlinear deformation from fingerprint images.

Instead of using the <b>minutia</b> type and orientation angle, which are widely employed in existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm uses only the <b>minutia</b> location, to reduce the effect of non-linear distortion.

5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the <b>minutiae</b> of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E
25|$|Pre-processing helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. The <b>minutiae</b> based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image. A reason was that an 8-bit gray fingerprint image was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: <b>minutiae</b> extraction and false <b>minutiae</b> removal. The <b>minutiae</b> extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After the <b>minutiae</b> extraction step, the false <b>minutiae</b> removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false <b>minutiae</b> that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E

40|$|Establishing correspondences {{between two}} <b>minutia</b> sets is a {{fundamental}} issue in fingerprint recognition. This paper proposes a new tensor matching strategy. First, the concept of <b>minutia</b> tensor matrix (simplified as MTM) is proposed. It describes the first-order features and second-order features of a matching pair. In the MTM, the diagonal elements indicate similarities of <b>minutia</b> pairs and non-diagonal elements indicate pairwise compatibilities between <b>minutia</b> pairs. Correct <b>minutia</b> pairs are likely to establish both large similarities and large compatibilities, so they form a dense sub-block. <b>Minutia</b> matching is then formulated as recovering the dense sub-block in the MTM. This is a new tensor matching strategy for fingerprint recognition. Second, as fingerprint images show both local rigidity and global nonlinearity, we design two different kinds of MTMs: local MTM and global MTM. Meanwhile, a two-level matching algorithm is proposed. For local matching level, the local MTM is constructed and a novel local similarity calculation strategy is proposed. It makes full use of local rigidity in fingerprints. For global matching level, the global MTM is constructed to calculate similarities of entire <b>minutia</b> sets. It makes full use of global compatibility in fingerprints. Proposed method has stronger description ability and better robustness to noise and nonlinearity. Experiments conducted on Fingerprint Verification Competition databases (FVC 2002 and FVC 2004) demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency...|$|R

Simulation results show that equal error rate (EER) of the <b>minutia</b> based system is around 1. 7 % which is {{much smaller than the}} EER obtained for correlation filters. This suggests that <b>minutia</b> based system is more robust to plastic distortion inherent in the fingerprint images...|$|R
40|$|A novel minutia-based {{fingerprint}} {{matching algorithm}} is proposed that employs iterative global alignment on two <b>minutia</b> sets. The matcher considers all possible <b>minutia</b> pairings and iteratively aligns the two sets until the number of <b>minutia</b> pairs does not exceed {{the maximum number of}} allowable one-to-one pairings. The optimal alignment parameters are derived analytically via linear least squares. The first alignment establishes a region of overlap between the two <b>minutia</b> sets, which is then (iteratively) refined by each successive alignment. After each alignment, <b>minutia</b> pairs that exhibit weak correspondence are discarded. The process is repeated until the number of remaining pairs no longer exceeds the maximum number of allowable one-to-one pairings. The proposed algorithm is tested on both the FVC 2000 and FVC 2002 databases, and the results indicate that the proposed matcher is both effective and efficient for fingerprint authentication; it is fast and does not utilize any computationally expensive mathematical functions (e. g. trigonometric, exponential). In addition to the proposed matcher, another contribution of the paper is the analytical derivation of the least squares solution for the optimal alignment parameters for two point-sets lacking exact correspondence.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Minutia</b> {{points are}} the local {{discontinuities}} in the fingerprint pattern. There are {{many types of}} <b>minutia</b> identified. However two types of <b>minutia</b> viz.,terminations and bifurcations are considered for automatic fingerprint identification purposes. Accurate extraction of <b>minutia</b> points {{is the first step}} towards developing a reliable fingerprint recognition system. However a fingerprint image may not always be well captured and may contain noise which hinders the clarity of the ridge and valley structures. This could be due to variations in skin structure such as scars, and certain impression conditions such as humidity, dirt, and non-uniform contact with the fingerprint capturing device. Image enhancement techniques are therefore required and are often employed to reduce the noise and enhance the definition of ridges against valleys.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of the Internet, remote {{verification}} of identity is an increasingly important part of modern life. From online banking systems to personal data storage to software as a service, most aspects of modern life require identity verification. Traditional authentication systems rely on the possession of a token, generally a password or smartcard. Token-based identity transactions are relatively easy to repudiate since unauthorized persons may possess the token. A system that can guarantee a user’s presence during authentication would greatly enhance the non-reputability of these transactions. Biometrics can provide this strong link between users and their identities. By measuring and comparing a feature of the user, we can increase the assurance that the user is present during authentication. Fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used for identity verification. However, these require a careful balance of accuracy and privacy that is missing in many implementations. This dissertation describes a new biometric matching system, the protection of an existing data-type, and a model for matching security with error correction codes. My research develops the Vaulted Verification (VV) system into Vaulted Fingerprint Verification (VFV) by implementing VV on a fingerprint <b>minutia</b> triangle representation [1]. Triangle representation contains much information that enhances the accuracy of the system. VFV matcher requires no order or relation between the <b>minutia</b> triangles. VFV allows for key exchange and remote authentication using the challenge response protocol. Protected biometric template is used to preform the authentication. Privacy and security of the user's biometric data is preserved through multiple levels of protection. First, the system uses a protected transmission protocol to transmit the authentication token. Second, <b>minutia</b> triangles are difficult to invert. Third, VFV is compatible with protected <b>minutia</b> data types. VFV is built on blocks containing several <b>minutia</b> triangles. Selecting several <b>minutia</b> triangles within a block provides tolerance to common errors in fingerprint images. The blocks are permuted to store arbitrary data, such as encryption keys or an authenticator challenge. The data is combined with an error correcting code to provide tolerance to inter-image errors in fingerprint <b>minutia.</b> VFV is fully compatible with protected biometric data-types. This is demonstrated by including a protected <b>minutia</b> descriptor, Protected <b>Minutia</b> Cylinder Code (PMCC) [2]. PMCC is known for its ability to enhance the accuracy of matching fingerprint <b>minutia</b> while being difficult to invert. Augmented VFV features with PMCC enhance the accuracy of the system. A modification of PMCC is developed in this dissertation to enhance the privacy of the system. The PMCC's within a <b>minutia</b> triangle are XORed together. The XOR procedure greatly enhances the non-invertiblity of PMCC, while having a small impact on VFV accuracy. Due to the importance of error correcting codes (ECC) in VFV, a model of security with ECC is developed. It is used to identify non-trivial potential attacker uses of ECC bits...|$|R

This paper concentrates on a more accurate fingerprint indexing algorithm that efficiently retrieves the top N possible matching candidates from a huge database. To this end, we design a novel feature based on <b>minutia</b> neighborhood structure (we call this <b>minutia</b> detail and it contains richer <b>minutia</b> information) and a more stable triangulation algorithm (low-order Delaunay triangles, consisting of order 0 and 1 Delaunay triangles), which are both insensitive to fingerprint distortion. The indexing features include <b>minutia</b> detail and attributes of low-order Delaunay triangle (its handedness, angles, maximum edge, and related angles between orientation field and edges). Experiments on databases FVC 2002 and FVC 2004 show that the proposed algorithm considerably narrows down the search space in fingerprint databases and is stable for various fingerprints.

For simplicity of pattern recognition system design, a sequential approach consisting of sensing, feature extraction and matching is conventionally adopted where each stage transforms a particular component of information relatively independently.

Some of the errors in the end-to-end sequential processing can be easily eliminated especially for the feature extraction stage by revisiting the original image data. We propose a feedback path for the feature extraction stage, followed by a feature refinement stage for improving the matching performance. This performance improvement is illustrated {{in the context of}} a minutiae-based fingerprint verification system. We show that a <b>minutia</b> verification stage based on reexamining the gray-scale profile in a detected <b>minutia's</b> spatial neighborhood in the sensed image can improve the matching performance by ~ 4 % on our database. Further, we show that a feature refinement stage which assigns a class label to each detected <b>minutia</b> (ridge ending and ridge bifurcation) before matching can also improve the matching performance by ~ 3 %.
