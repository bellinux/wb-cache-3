The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

Some early rebel groups emerged in the state, such as those led by Felipe Tinoco and Catarino Palacios, {{but they were also}} eventually executed. After 1812, insurgents began to have some success in the state, especially in the areas around Huajuapan de León, where Valerio Trujano defended the city against royalist forces until José María Morelos y Pavón was able to come in with support to keep the area in rebel hands.

25|$|The {{policies}} of the Díaz government caused resentment not only among the Yaquis, but also throughout the country. One of the preludes to the Mexican Revolution was the 1906 Cananea miner's strike. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, {{but he refused to}} <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried {{to take control of the}} mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they put everything to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which Díaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.|$|E
25|$|Devonshire took {{an active}} {{interest}} {{in the lives of}} Canadians, and conducted various tours of the country to <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> As a land owner himself, the Governor General was particularly focused on the development of farming in Canada and during his travels, at agricultural and horticultural fairs, shows, and sugaring-off parties in the Gatineau, he discussed agricultural issues with farmers and other people in the industry. His speeches often referred to Canada's potential to lead the world in agricultural research and development, and one of his major projects while viceroy was to establish experimental farms, including the Crown's central one in Ottawa. At the same time, Devonshire acted as a patron of the arts; when not on tour or residing at La Citadelle the viceregal residence in Quebec City at which the Duke enjoyed spending time he frequently visited the National Gallery and hosted theatrical performances at Rideau Hall. There, {{on the grounds of the}} royal residence, during the winters, the Devonshires also hosted tobogganing and skating parties, as well as hockey matches. Officially, in 1918 Devonshire travelled to the United States to meet President Woodrow Wilson informally, and the following year, he was host to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, during his first tour of Canada.|$|E

On January 20, Fraser wired the Mint from his studio in New York, announcing that he was submitting a modified design, and explained that the delay was [...] "caused by working with inventor until he was satisfied".

500|$|In the trial, Nayyouf was {{connected}} with a CDF leaflet questioning {{the results of the}} uncontested presidential election of 1991 and calling attention to Syrian human rights violations.

Provisions guaranteeing the rights of the accused under the Constitution of Syria are not binding on the SSSC, which tries political and national security cases, and lawyers representing Nayyouf and the other defendants were not allowed to <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> before the trial. During the trial, the CDF defendants reported being tortured in custody, which the presiding judge ignored. International observers at Nayyouf's trial stated that it did not meet international standards of judicial fairness. As editor-in-chief of Sawt al-Democratiyya, Nayyouf received the harshest sentence of all the CDF members on trial. Nayyouf was sentenced on 17 March 1992 to 10 years of hard labour.

500|$|In 1856, Balakirev {{and critic}} Vladimir Stasov, who {{publicly}} espoused a nationalist agenda for Russian arts, started gathering young composers through whom to spread ideas and gain a following.

Modest Mussorgsky, a Preobrazhensky Lifeguard officer, joined them in 1857; Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a naval cadet, in 1861; and Alexander Borodin, a chemist, in 1862. Balakirev, Borodin, Cui, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov composed in their spare time, and all five of them were young men in 1862, with Rimsky-Korsakov at just 18 the youngest and Borodin the oldest at 28. All five were essentially self-taught and eschewed conservative and [...] "routine" [...] musical techniques. They {{became known as the}} kuchka, variously translated as The Five, The Russian Five and The Mighty Handful after a review written by Stasov about their music. Stasov wrote, [...] "May God grant that [...] for ever a memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent and ability is possessed by the small but already mighty handful [...] of Russian musicians".

500|$|In late June 1989, {{opponents of}} the turnpike boycotted local {{businesses}} that {{were members of the}} Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, which was in favor of the turnpike. Some turnpike protesters removed their names from the customer list at Mazzio's Italian Eatery on June 23. On June 24, about forty protesters picketed the Bank of Oklahoma, and around six closed their accounts. The chief executives of both businesses were {{on the board of the}} Chamber of Commerce. In response to the boycott, Mayor Randle issued a statement accusing Tulsans Against Turnpikes of [...] "seeking to wage economic coercion against businesses" [...] and described their tactics as [...] " [...] as a kind of economic blackmail to silence debate", as well as [...] "allowing differences of opinion to degenerate into intimidation against those who have taken public stands unpopular with [...] ". Randle also canceled a planned meeting with the group, refusing to <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> until they ceased the boycott. A Tulsans Against Turnpikes board member publicly replied to the mayor's statement by denying that a boycott was taking place, stating that the group only recommended that members not do business with Mazzio's and Bank of Oklahoma because of their support for the Creek Turnpike project via their activity with the Chamber of Commerce.

500|$|The {{story of}} Caligari is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and {{includes}} little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, {{which is more}} heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted {{to get rid of}} them, but they persisted until he agreed to <b>meet</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: [...] "They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film".|$|E
