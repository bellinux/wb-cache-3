500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it {{from someone who}} has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports {{reporter}} in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I was scared of the part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie". At the time, he noted it was a [...] "little frustrating" [...] that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends. He subsequently appeared opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Alfonso Arau's straight-to-cable comedy Picking Up the Pieces (2000).|$|E

2500|$|Although {{visitors}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by {{the apparently}} {{large number of}} cycle parking facilities in Copenhagen, there {{is in fact a}} severe lack of available cycle stands, and among the subjective indicators measured by the city, bicycle parking fares worst, with only 29% being satisfied with the facilities. There are approximately 560.000 bicycles in the city of Copenhagen, more bicycles than people, yet they share only 48.000 bicycle stands. With a view to remedying the situation, in 2008 the Danish Cyclists Federation published a [...] "Bicycling Parking Manual" [...] with a number of guidelines. They are of immediate practical use to today's users but they also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future. A number of projects have been launched to ease Copenhagen's notorious shortage of bicycle parking spaces, particularly at transport hubs. While the city expects there will always be more bicycles in Copenhagen than parking spots, it hopes to increase satisfaction with bicycle parking significantly by 2025, through a coordinated effort to improve conditions and facilities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind and you <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at how much you get out of it".|$|E

Vigeland began work on the sculpture about 1904.

2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then {{disappeared}} and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E
