40|$|Starting from Hargreaves’ (1986 a) {{review of}} the {{relationship}} between developmental psychology and music education, we characterise the mid- 1980 s as a point at which the different main strands of music psychology – cognitive, developmental, and social – began to unfold. We move to the present day and beyond, suggesting that a major change has been the incorporation of a social perspective: it may now make more sense to talk about the developmental social psychology of music and music education. Four levels of social influence are distinguished – the individual, the interpersonal, the institutional,and the cultural – and we suggest that the concept of identity may enable explanations of social influence at the individual level. We review some research on <b>musical</b> style <b>sensitivity</b> as an exemplar of this general approach, and conclude by applying the social–cultural perspective to current developments in music education.

The second question examined was whether pitch perception was influenced by language inventory. Therefore the same perception experiment was conducted cross-linguistically with Catalan listeners in Spain.

40|$|After intensive, {{long-term}} musical training, {{the auditory}} system of a musician is specifically tuned to perceive musical sounds. We wished {{to find out}} whether a musician′s auditory system also develops increased sensitivity to any sound of everyday life, experiencing them as noise. For this purpose, an online survey, including questionnaires on noise <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>musical</b> background, and listening tests for assessing musical aptitude, was administered to 197 participants in Finland and Italy. Subjective noise sensitivity (assessed with the Weinstein′s Noise Sensitivity Scale) was analyzed for associations with musicianship, musical aptitude, weekly time spent listening to music, and the importance of music in each person′s life (or music importance). Subjects were divided into three groups according to their musical expertise: Nonmusicians (N = 103), amateur musicians (N = 44), and professional musicians (N = 50). The results showed that noise sensitivity did not depend on musical expertise or performance on musicality tests or the amount of active (attentive) listening to music. In contrast, it was associated with daily passive listening to music, so that individuals with higher noise sensitivity spent less time in passive (background) listening to music than those with lower sensitivity to noise. Furthermore, noise-sensitive respondents rated music as less important in their life than did individuals with lower sensitivity to noise. The results demonstrate that the special sensitivity of the auditory system derived from musical training does not lead to increased irritability from unwanted sounds. However, the disposition to tolerate contingent musical backgrounds in everyday life depends on the individual′s noise sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Ensemble musicians {{exchange}} auditory {{and visual}} signals that can facilitate interpersonal synchronisation. Musical expertise improves how precisely auditory and visual signals are perceptually integrated and increases sensitivity to asynchrony between them.

This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} musicians are more sensitive to audiovisual asynchrony in performances featuring their own instrument than in performances featuring other instruments. Short clips were extracted from audio-video recordings of clarinet, piano, and violin performances and presented to highly-skilled clarinettists, pianists, and violinists.

Though research {{pertaining to}} Christian hymnals {{published in the}} late twentieth century is substantial with much of the work focusing on cultural issues, statistical comparisons, textual concerns, and denominational legislation, a significant examination of the decision-making process used by editorial boards to compile Roman Catholic hymnals is lacking. For the many Christian churches that create their own denominational hymnals there are reports and committee minutes within an official legislative record that detail the compilation process. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, where the main publishers are unattached to the official church, fewer details are in the public record. This study examines the challenging process of issuing a hymnal specifically for use in the Roman Catholic Church in the United States during the hymnal explosion of the 1980 s, focusing on the decisions made by GIA Publications' editorial committee to provide parishes with a collection of songs sensitive to the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the effects of the twentieth century's global ecumenical movement, the call for increased theological relevance pertaining to issues of ecology, poverty, urban life, hunger, and peace, and contemporary concerns about language that might require the creation of new, more appropriate texts, the revision of older texts, or the elimination of now inappropriate texts. Through a series of interviews with the still-living members of the editorial board of GIA Publications' Worship: A Hymnal and Service Book for Roman Catholics, third edition (1986), an examination of the marketing literature produced by the publisher encouraging potential customers to purchase the hymnal, and articles written in support or in review of the hymnal in professional journals, there emerges a clear picture of a decision-making process informed by the Second Vatican Council's directives for liturgical reform, ecumenical <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>musical</b> excellence, and congregational participation, tempered by the reality of publishing within a corporate, for-profit environment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>musical</b> styles in children aged between 3 and 16 years old. The thesis is divided into four parts. The {{first part of the}} thesis explores the historical background of the developmental and the social psychology of music and reviews some pertinent previous literature. This section places the later studies in a theoretical context. The second part presents a review of the four previous studies, which have been carried out into style sensitivity, namely, Gardner (1973), Castell (1983), Tafuri et al. (1994) and Hargreaves and North (1999). This section of the thesis also includes a review of a number of methodological issues and gives a full description of the design of the test methodology. Six experiments are carried out and reported in the thesis. Experiment one explores the effect of varying the lesson context in which the style sensitivity test is presented to the participants, whilst experiment two explores the effect of varying the test presenter on participants' test performance. The third experiment is a comparative study between participants in three different regions, one region within the UK and two regions within the USA. The participants in each of these three regions all experienced a number of variations in their music education programme, the status accorded to music within that music education programme and also considerable variation in participants' commercial musical diet. The experiment explores whether or not these variations affect {{the development of}} <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>musical</b> styles. Part three of the thesis manipulates two further variables firstly, by varying the introduction to the style sensitivity and secondly, by manipulating the musical material used in the test. Experiment four presents two variations to the test introduction. In the first condition the introduction is changed through the offer of a reward and in the second condition, the introduction is changed {{in order to make the}} experiment competitive. The fifth experiment attempts to manipulate the musical material used in the style sensitivity test by increasing the level of stylistic divergence between the musical extracts. This is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a broad grained method of measuring various artefactual elements within the extracts is devised and incorporated into the selection of the musical test material. Secondly, the stylistic divergence between the musical extracts in increased by extending the chronological period between the musical eras used in the musical extracts. Part four presents the findings of an exploratory study. Experiment six attempted to create a new test methodology which was appropriate for use on younger children. The new methodology was successfully piloted in order to further explore style sensitivity in participants aged between 3 and 5 years of age. In the last section, a review of the six experiments is given and this is accompanied by a number of implications for further research. Finally, a model of the development of style sensitivity is presented. This model proposes that <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>musical</b> style is not a single unitary skill, the development of which is linear, and therefore any measurement of <b>musical</b> style <b>sensitivity</b> should be seen as a multidimensional description of a combination of abilities, skills and knowledge. The model proposes that acquiring the ability to be sensitive to musical styles can best be seen as the progression from stylistic discrimination to stylistic competence...|$|R
50|$|Born in London, Anthony James Dowell {{began his}} dance {{training}} there in 1948, {{at the tender}} age of five. His first ballet teacher was June Hampshire, who nurtured her young pupil and instilled in him the discipline necessary for serious students of ballet. When he was ten years old, he enrolled in the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, then located in Barons Court, and embarked on a course of training for young people interested in pursuing a career in dance. In 1955, the school moved to White Lodge, Richmond Park, and became residential, combining general education and vocational ballet training. In 1956, when a royal charter was granted to the Sadler's Wells Ballet, the school was renamed the Royal Ballet School. Dowell continued his training there, moving to the Barons Court studios for the final three years of his course of study. An outstanding student, blessed with a perfectly proportioned physique and a temperament compatible to the rigors of daily training, he gradually developed a classical technique remarkable for secure control, purity of line, and <b>musical</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Upon his graduation in 1960, he was immediately taken into the Covent Garden Opera Ballet. After a year dancing with this company, he was invited to join the Royal Ballet.|$|E
