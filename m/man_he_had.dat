5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent <b>man,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of the}} murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E
5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as smoothly. The Bagaudae had been easily suppressed, but Carausius, the <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{put in charge}} of operations against Saxon and Frankish pirates on the Saxon Shore, had, according to literary sources, begun keeping the goods seized from the pirates for himself. Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul into open revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|Within a year, he {{abandoned}} her and married Annia Aurelia Faustina, {{a descendant of}} Marcus Aurelius and the widow of a <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recently had executed. He had returned to his second wife Severa {{by the end of}} the year. According to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, whom he referred to as his husband.|$|E

5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious <b>man,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable <b>man.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose {{name has}} {{become synonymous with}} greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his {{religious}} faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young <b>man,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.|$|E

5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on {{a digital camera}} by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|White by {{then was}} in failing health, but {{made no move}} to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4, 1921. Taft called on the chief justice on March 26, and found White ill, but still {{carrying}} on his work and not talking of retiring. White did not retire, dying in office on May 19, 1921. Taft issued a tribute to the <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> appointed to the center seat, and waited and worried if he would be White's successor. Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement. Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|Charles August was {{no great}} admirer of Joseph's. As a younger <b>man,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sought {{the hand of}} Joseph's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better-connected Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the {{daughter}} of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called duc de Deux-Ponts (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young <b>man,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{traveled}} widely, and made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
5|$|It had {{now become}} clear to President Johnson that McNamara {{had become a}} {{liability}} to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned his position {{and was replaced by}} Clark Clifford, who was chosen because of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara's suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara's position, however was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, (until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign). Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi's reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt the views of the <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from an open-ended commitment to the war.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E

5|$|At 09:00 on 21 October, US 3/187 RCT {{began to}} advance south {{to clear the}} Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang. The American paratroopers {{advanced}} on two fronts, with I Company moving along the railway line and K Company along the highway. At 13:00 I Company reached Opa-ri, where it encountered a strong North Korean force estimated as a battalion, equipped with 120mm mortars and 40mm guns. I Company was caught in an ambush. The North Koreans subsequently attacked the paratroopers and after a battle lasting two-and-a-half hours, they overran two American platoons. I Company was forced to withdraw west of the railway to Hill 281 having suffered 90 men missing. Despite their success, the North Koreans subsequently withdrew to their own defensive positions in the high ground around Opa-ri. Amid the fighting, an American medic attached to I Company, Private First Class Richard G. Wilson, was killed while attempting to reach a wounded {{man who had been}} left behind, and he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Wilson had repeatedly exposed himself to North Korean fire to render aid to the wounded, and later helped many to safety following the order to withdraw. On hearing that one of the Americans previously thought to be dead had been seen attempting to crawl to safety, {{he went back to the}} battlefield to search for him and had disappeared. Two days later a patrol found Wilson lying dead beside the <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> returned to rescue, having been shot while trying to shield him from further injury.|$|E
5|$|In England's reply, captain Alastair Cook {{played in}} a fashion {{reminiscent}} of the <b>man</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> replaced for the tour, Strauss, as he played an accumulatory innings to score 64. Kieswetter, who had been brought into the team to provide firepower {{at the start of}} the innings was outscored by Cook 4 to 1, and was nearly dismissed twice in his first over, offering an edge to wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, and two balls later he was caught in front, but umpire Rod Tucker ruled that he was not out. Kieswetter was dismissed in the 13th over for 19, completely missing a drive; presenting Mushfiqur with an easy stumping. An over later, Kevin Pietersen fell for just one run, leaving England on 74/2. Cook and new man Collingwood put on 22 runs before the opener was adjudged leg before wicket (LBW) though replays indicated that the ball was missing the stumps on the leg side. Collingwood then anchored the chase with Eoin Morgan, the pair adding 88 runs to the score. After the dismissal of Morgan on 33, it was left to Prior to join Collingwood to add the required runs, and England won with four overs to spare.|$|E
