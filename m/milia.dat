5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as <b>milia.</b>|$|E

500|$|Many skin {{conditions}} can mimic acne vulgaris and are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. [...] Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, <b>milia,</b> perioral dermatitis, and rosacea, among others. Age is one factor which may help distinguish between these disorders. Skin {{disorders such as}} perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood, whereas rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults. Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is suggestive of rosacea. The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance. [...] Chloracne, due to exposure to certain chemicals, may look very similar to acne vulgaris.|$|E

5000|$|With a more {{deliberate}} and polished production, Enter the Kingdom {{was met by}} a critical response ranging from laudatory to mixed. Thematically, the record was described {{in an interview with}} the Detroit Free Press as addressing economic hardship in songwriter Matthew <b>Milia's</b> immediate family and the disillusionment of childhood. These heavy lyrical elements were juxtaposed with frequent power pop song structures and the lush string arrangements of Zachary Nichols. British art magazine Aesthetica saw the album as [...] "a swaying invitation into the suburban American household, offering a dreamy glance back into a past forgotten life." [...] Much notice was given to the precision of <b>Milia's</b> rhyme schemes, with legendary rock critic Robert Christgau commenting, [...] "Somebody marry this winsome sad sack, whose increasingly plausible rhymes now include open-ibuprofen, gauche-precocious-neurosis, salad on the tennis court-valid passport, speckled melanin-freckled up your skin, and the very sexy errands-gerunds." [...] Mojo went on to say, [...] "Well-educated, literary-inclined American songwriters are hardly thin on the ground, but Frontier Ruckus' Matthew <b>Milia's</b> poetic inclination always sets him apart.” ...|$|R
