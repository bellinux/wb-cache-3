30|$|While deontological {{evaluation}} is a person’s perception {{of an action}} based one’s own set of personal values and perceived <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> [36], {{in the context of}} this study it is a manager’s perception regarding whether the use of quality management is aligned with personal values or <b>moral</b> <b>obligations.</b> An organization often shapes its strategy around certain <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> its stakeholders [61]. Managers often believe they have fundamental <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> stakeholders via their managerial roles [61]. This <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> can promote job involvement or performing job functions to one’s utmost potential [62]. This includes enhancing both social and technical quality management practices. Quality management can greatly impact an organization’s performance and often may have dire consequences if not adequately conducted. This is evidenced by situations including GM’s reluctant recall of a defective ignition switch causing 13 deaths and 54 accidents [63]. Unfortunate events like this remind firms of top management’s <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> not only consumers, but also to internal and supply chain stakeholders as well. Positive deontological evaluation will help enhance managerial motivation to conduct quality management practices extensively, thus impacting product, process and administrative innovation as evidenced by previous literature [4, 5, 9, 37 - 39].|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s {{developments}} {{were reported}} on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E
25|$|On the pro-terraforming {{side of the}} argument, {{there are}} those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor and the late Carl Sagan who {{believe that it is}} humanity's <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> make other worlds {{suitable}} for life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They also point out that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.|$|E

The schism between Rome and the Byzantine Empire was a severe blow to him, and he worked hard to restore the former amicable relationship. Gregory successfully tried {{to get in touch}} with the emperor Michael VII. When the news of the Muslim attacks on the Christians in the East filtered through to Rome, and the political embarrassments of the Byzantine emperor increased, he conceived the project of a great military expedition and exhorted the faithful to participate in recovering the Church of the Holy Sepulchre – foreshadowing the First Crusade. In his efforts to recruit for the expedition, he emphasized the suffering of eastern Christians, arguing western Christians had a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> go to their aid.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, as Chairman of EDB, {{he decided}} to name {{publicly}} the holders of government scholarships who broke their bonds to shame them. This created a controversy generating public debates on whether those who received scholarship have a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> serve, or whether the scholarship is merely a contractual agreement which could be broken {{in return for the}} stated penalties. The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led to even more unhappiness at the audacity of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Aiken was Minister for Finance {{for three}} years {{following}} the war and was involved in economic post–war development in the industrial, agricultural, educational and other spheres. However, it was during his two periods as Minister for External Affairs—1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1969-that Aiken fulfilled his enormous political potential. As Foreign Minister he adopted where possible an independent stance for Ireland at the United Nations and other international forums such as the Council of Europe. Despite {{a great deal of}} opposition, both at home and abroad, he stubbornly asserted the right of smaller UN member countries to discuss the representation of communist China at the General Assembly. Unable to bring the issue of the partition of Ireland to the UN, because of Britain's veto on the Security Council and unwillingness of other Western nations to interfere in what they saw as British affairs at that time (the US taking a more ambiguous position), Aiken ensured that Ireland vigorously defended the rights of small nations such as Tibet and Hungary, nations whose problems he felt Ireland could identify with and had a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> help.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} ethics {{framework that}} is typically taught to medical students and residents is deeply flawed, {{and the result}} of using this framework exclusively to resolve ethical conflicts at the bedside is compromised patient care. The author calls this framework the principlist paradigm and maintains that it blinds clinicians from seeing the full set of <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> they have <b>to</b> the patient and limits the range of options they see as available to navigate through ethical conflicts. Although {{it is important for the}} <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> it does recognize (e. g., those based on the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice), the principlist paradigm should not be used as the only moral template for case analysis. The author illustrates the paradigm’s limitations with a clinical case study, in which the treating clinicians failed to recognize three important <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> the patient: the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> express regret, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> apologize, and the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> make amends. The failure to recognize these widely accepted <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> can have tragic consequences. The principlist paradigm undertrains clinicians for the complex ethical dilemmas they face in practice, and medical ethics educators need to rethink the tools they offer student clinicians to guide their ethical analysis. The author advocates a reexamination of this standard approach to teaching clinical ethics...|$|R

In October 1999, Mugabe visited Britain; in London, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell attempted to place him under citizen's arrest. Mugabe believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him. It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations, with Mugabe expressing scorn for what he called [...] "Blair and company". In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe.

500|$|In 1843, Holmes {{published}} [...] "The Contagiousness of puerperal fever" [...] in {{the short-lived}} publication New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery. The essay argued—contrary {{to popular belief}} at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of puerperal fever, a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient to patient contact via their physicians. Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of puerperal fever had occurred, had a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice {{for a period of}} at least six months.

50|$|In Frontiers and Ghettos, James Ron {{argues that}} states use {{different}} methods and degrees of coercion against perceived national enemies {{as a result}} of variation in institutional contexts. When a targeted group is ghettoized, they are likely to become victims of severe, police-style repression but not ethnic cleansing or murder. Contrarily, when a targeted group exists on a frontier, {{they are more likely to}} become victims of cleansing and death instead of repression. This is because in ghettos, states have unrivaled control but are also bound by international and domestic legal and <b>moral</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> its inhabitants. Along frontiers, states have less control as well as fewer and weaker <b>moral</b> <b>obligations.</b> According <b>to</b> Ron, the more that a state controls a given territory, the more it feels a “bureaucratic, moral, and political sense of responsibility” for the fate of those within it. This sense of responsibility leads states to choose less overtly violent modes of repression in ghettos as compared to when states target populations exist on the periphery.|$|R
