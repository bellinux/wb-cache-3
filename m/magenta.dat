5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} <b>magenta,</b> {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to <b>magenta</b> was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using <b>magenta</b> in favor of crimson.|$|E

5|$|The flower as a {{whole is}} usually {{radially}} symmetrical (actinomorphic), but may be bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) in some species. Flower colors range from white through yellow and red to <b>magenta.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} the solos varies in certain albums. In the movie and Roxy cast album, Columbia's solo is right after <b>Magenta's,</b> then Columbia does her tap dance after a second chorus. The version {{that has been in}} stage shows more {{recently}} is similar to the movie and Roxy cast, with Columbia singing her solo right after <b>Magenta's,</b> but then she does her tap dance right after her solo, leaving only two choruses. Occasionally, Columbia's solo and tap dance come after the chorus after <b>Magenta's</b> solo.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magenta's</b> fifth album, Chameleon, was {{released}} in November 2011. It features several shorter tracks but mostly with a hard edge, similar to the previous album Metamorphosis. At this time, <b>Magenta's</b> full members were confirmed to be Rob Reed, Christina Booth and Chris Fry, with other musicians brought in for studio recordings and live gigs. Kieran Bailey recorded drums on the album but no longer plays with the live version of the band.|$|R
25|$|<b>Magenta's</b> eighth studio album, The Twenty Seven Club, {{directly}} references the club. Each {{track is}} a tribute to a member of the club.|$|R
5|$|The base colour of {{the flag}} is a dark blue (reflex blue, a mix of cyan and <b>magenta),</b> while the golden stars are portrayed in yellow. The colours are {{regulated}} according to the Pantone colouring system (see table for specifications).|$|E
5|$|The {{voice of}} Captain Ochre was {{provided}} by English-born Canadian, Jeremy Wilkin. Having served {{in the role of}} Virgil Tracy during the second series of Thunderbirds, Wilkin remained to voice Ochre for the subsequent production. The character of Captain <b>Magenta,</b> meanwhile, was voiced by Gary Files. Another Australian actor, Files was a fresh addition to Century 21 Productions, and was cast for a number of roles in the second Thunderbirds film, Thunderbird 6, before progressing to the role of <b>Magenta</b> for Captain Scarlet. Like Files, Welsh actress Liz Morgan was new to the Anderson productions and voiced the regular characters of Destiny Angel, the lead pilot of the Spectrum Angel fighter squadron, and one of her subordinates, Rhapsody Angel.|$|E
5|$|Mileena is {{a player}} and {{occasional}} boss character from the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games. A dual sai-wielding assassin, she acts as the evil twin and <b>magenta</b> palette swap of Princess Kitana in Mortal Kombat II. She has been promoted throughout the Mortal Kombat games as its semi-iconic sex symbol ever since , when she began a pattern of wearing more revealing outfits.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th {{century the}} club had nicknames {{including}} the Cockledivers, the Seaside Men, the Seasiders and the <b>Magentas.</b> In 1900, Port finished bottom in the six-team competition, {{which it has}} not done in any senior league since.|$|R
50|$|With {{the fall}} of <b>Magenta's</b> kingdom, Faye, her only daughter, was given the duty to find the 3 missing amulets that could rebuild Engkantasya. Enteng {{and his family are}} once again sucked into the magical world and have to travel through Satana's kingdom to save Engkantasya.|$|R
5000|$|In 1863, {{the first}} canine {{exhibition}} {{was held at}} the [...] "Jardin d'Acclimatation" [...] in Paris, France. The winner of the Dogue de Bordeaux was a female named <b>Magentas.</b> The Dogue de Bordeaux was then given the name of the capital of its region of origin, today's Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|R
5|$|Ross said {{he wanted}} the piece to exude organic forms, drawn {{from the city and}} its surroundings. The choice of <b>magenta</b> and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that his creation is missing, Frank {{returns to the}} lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. <b>Magenta</b> interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.|$|E
5|$|Brad and Janet {{are shown}} to {{separate}} bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) {{and then as}} Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, who she discovers, via a television monitor, is in bed with Frank. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as <b>Magenta</b> and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship. Brennus {{formed the basis for}} the subsequent group of five broadly similar battleships built to the same design specifications, begun with Charles Martel, though they reverted to the armament layout of the earlier <b>Magentas</b> which saw the main guns distributed in single turrets in a lozenge pattern.|$|R
5000|$|To {{emulate the}} graphic novel {{printing}} process, Marc Munden {{chose to use}} a Technicolor palette: [...] "The three-strip Technicolor process we use is [...] the opposite colours -- yellows, cyan, <b>magentas.</b> I was interested in Doris Day films from the 1950s that pushed those distinct elements." [...] Colourist Aidan Farrell used grading software Nucoda Film Master to paint bolder colours into the shots. By the second series the production crew were pre-preparing the film sets for grading ...|$|R
5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and <b>Magenta's</b> maid's uniform.|$|R
5|$|Inspection under {{infrared}} {{has revealed}} that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small <b>magenta</b> horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Night falls, and Captain <b>Magenta</b> detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air. To prevent civilian casualties on the ground, Cloudbase is moved into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear on the radar, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with <b>magenta</b> flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
50|$|The {{new series}} has more complex romantic subplots, with both Captain Scarlet {{in the present}} and Captain Black in the past dating Destiny Angel, and the hints of a {{potential}} relationship between Captain Blue and Lieutenant Green, as well as flirtations between several other characters. Examples include Captain Ochre and an off-Skybase motorcycle gang member called Colt, and Captain <b>Magenta's</b> all round womaniser image. The original series had hinted at a one-time relationship between Scarlet and Destiny Angel, and an ongoing approach between Blue and Symphony Angel.|$|R
50|$|It {{remained}} peaceful {{until it}} was invaded in the 1490s. The first significant Italian victory by Napoleon {{took place in the}} province on 10 May 1796, where the 5,000 men-strong forces of Napoleon defeated Austrian forces of 10,000 men. It fell under Austrian rule until the Austrians left the city in 1859 and it was ruled by Marshal Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of <b>Magenta's</b> French forces from 10 June 1859. It later became a part of the kingdom of Italy and became a component of the province of Milan.|$|R
50|$|Satana - Formerly {{known as}} Amarillo, {{she ran away}} from Engkantasya {{when she was young}} and came back as the vile Satana. She was ever so jealous of the powers and domains her sisters {{received}} from their father. In Enteng Kabisote 2, it was revealed that Satana is Ina <b>Magenta's</b> prodigal sister. There was an instance in the TV series where Satana's character was portrayed by veteran actress Odette Khan, thereby completing the evil fairy triad. In the latter 3 movie installments of the series, her character is portrayed by actress Bing Loyzaga.|$|R
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or <b>magenta.</b> Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of <b>magenta,</b> black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|As the Mysterons {{start to}} fire on Cloudbase, Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with {{no possibility of}} recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being too weak to heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} <b>Magenta</b> and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive in the Control Room. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E
60|$|From this secluded spot {{these two}} {{dominated}} {{the entire length}} and breadth of the room; the dazzling scene was displayed before them in a gorgeous kaleidoscope of moving figures, in an ever-developing panorama of vividly coloured groups, that came and went, divided and reunited; now forming soft harmonies of delicate tones that suggested the subtle blending on the palette of a master, anon throwing on to the canvas daring patches of rich <b>magentas</b> or deep purples, that set off with cunning artfulness the masses of pale primrose and gold.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was very}} {{interested}} in rendering sunlit subjects on canvas, saying, [...] "It is sunshine, flowers in sunshine; girls in sunshine; the nude in sunshine, which I have been principally interested in. If I could only reproduce it exactly as I see it I would be satisfied." [...] However, his interpretation of sunshine often did not appear natural. According to a recent observer, [...] "His light hardly seems to be plein air light at all. In fact it seems entirely artificial ... a stunning concoction of blues and <b>magentas</b> frosted with early summer green and flecks of white." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} year, Pratap showcased is autumn winter {{line in the}} WIFW titled Valentino Rossi meets Mother Teresa, Biker's Jacket meet the Saree {{depicting}} glimpses of India to the West in a completely new manner. Black dominated the pallette with an underplay of electric blues, <b>magentas</b> and reds. The range showcased varied amalgamation of sillhouettes such as one-piece dresses in textured leathers, dhoti pants, double-breasted and angrakha-jackets, and short jerseys paired with churidar-pants, as well as long skirts embellished with silver patterns. The collection came {{out to be an}} interesting combination of tough biker look and soft Indian elegance.|$|R
5|$|Carnot was {{the second}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was Charles Martel, which formed the basis for Carnot and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship Brennus, but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel <b>Magenta,</b> which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose <b>magenta</b> flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Bueno {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Sony Music that lasted only for the release of the album Sabroso; the next year he {{signed a contract}} with <b>Magenta</b> Records that granted him one percent of his record sales. He discarded salsa and merengue from his repertoire, recording and performing exclusively cuarteto. His first release with the label, Lo Mejor del Amor, became an instant radio hit, earning him national fame and an ACE Award for Best Musical Act. The success was followed by La Leyenda Continúa (certified gold by CAPIF) and Cuarteteando. His 1999 release A 2000 became the theme of a series of concerts begun in the Astral Theater and held the following year in the Luna Park Arena under the name of Cuarteto Característico Rodrigo A 2000 ("Characteristic Cuarteto, Rodrigo to 2000"). The show sold out the stadium thirteen times, while the album A 2000 was certified quadruple platinum.|$|E
2500|$|By 1904 Neo-Impressionism {{had evolved}} considerably, {{in a move}} away from nature, away from imitation, toward the {{distillation}} of essential geometric shapes and harmonious movements. These forms were considered superior to nature because they contained idea, representing {{the dominance of the}} artist over nature. Henri-Edmond Cross, Paul Signac, along with Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, André Derain (of the younger generation) began to paint with large brushstrokes that could never blend {{in the eye of the}} observer, with pure bold colors (reds, blues, yellows, greens and <b>magentas)</b> [...] "making them as free of the trammels of nature", writes Herbert, [...] "as any painting then being done in Europe." ...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Herbert writes, of {{the changes}} {{occurring}} in the early 20th century: [...] "By about 1904, {{the resolution of the}} dilemma was made in favor of the abstract side of the equation. [...] "Harmony means sacrifice", Cross said, and much of early Neo-Impressionism was jettisoned. Although they paid lip service to their established theory, Signac and Cross now painted in enormous strokes which could never pretend to mix in the eye, and which did not even retain nuance of tone. Raw, bold yellows, <b>magentas,</b> reds, blues, and greens sprang forth from their canvases, making them as free of the trammels of nature as any painting then being done in Europe." ...|$|R
