40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in deep soils {{and the role of}} Eucalyptus and Acacia on the structure of these communities remains very limited. In this study, we targeted the bacterial community along a depth profile (0 to 800 cm) and compared community structure in monospecific or mixed plantations of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis. We applied quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequence the V 6 region of the 16 S rRNA gene to characterize composition of bacterial communities. We identified a decrease in bacterial abundance with soil depth, and differences in community patterns between monospecific and <b>mixed</b> <b>cultivations.</b> Sequence analysis indicated a prevalent effect of soil depth on bacterial communities in the <b>mixed</b> plant <b>cultivation</b> system, and a remarkable differentiation of bacterial communities in areas solely cultivated with Eucalyptus. The groups most influenced by soil depth were Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria (more frequent in samples between 0 and 300 cm). The predominant bacterial groups differentially displayed in the monospecific stands of Eucalyptus were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Our results suggest that the addition of an N 2 -fixing tree in a monospecific cultivation system modulates bacterial community composition even at a great depth. We conclude that co-cultivation systems may represent a key strategy to improve soil resources and to establish more sustainable cultivation of Eucalyptus in Brazil. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Intercropping and {{agroforestry}} {{are mixed}} plant species cultivation systems that can potentially reduce pressure {{on land and}} water resources by generating higher crop yields and by increasing resource use efficiencies through exploitation of complementarities between species. While it is frequently claimed that <b>mixed</b> <b>cultivation</b> systems remain popular in Chinese agriculture, there are also reports {{that it is in}} decline. Little quantitative evidence is available on the prevalence of intercropping and agroforestry. Therefore, we conducted a village-level survey in 68 villages across six provinces in China in 2014 to document the prevalence of these mixed species cultivation systems in 2009 and 2014. We found that intercropping was practiced on approximately three percent of the arable land in the surveyed villages, while agroforestry was practiced on approximately one percent of the arable land and one percent of the area of plantation plus forest land. The use of both systems did not significantly change between 2009 and 2014. An explorative village-level analysis of factors associated with mixed species cultivation practices reveals a significant positive association with labour availability, and a smaller, but mostly significant, negative association with agricultural machinery power. These survey results provide the first systematically collected quantitative evidence on the current use and trend of <b>mixed</b> <b>cultivation</b> systems in China. The collected evidence indicates that these systems are currently used on a small proportion of the land, but have not declined in recent years.

Traditionally, rows of rubber trees have been combined with single cycles of food crops, and yields have often been low. Now experiments have come up with new combinations of crops which use few inputs and require no special material. The approach compensates for the non-productive period of the rubber trees youth, over the first five to seven years. The combinations of crops which work best in the forest soils are rice and groundnuts for two or three crop cycles, followed by plantain for one cycle, or cassava as an annual crop, or vegetables with rice, groundnuts and plantain for one or two cycles. There are many benefits to these mixtures: tillage is cut down, the rubber trees grow better, and farmers incomes rise and diversify.

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} are the common mode of bacterial existence in natural habitats. As such complex systems {{become more and}} more of interest for biotechnology as well as medical and ecological research, there is an increasing need for further knowledge of their behaviour. Three medically relevant bacteria causing lung diseases in cystic fibrosis patients (Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) and a chemically defined medium with glucose as carbon source were chosen as a model system. Pure culture growth characteristics and kinetic parameters were determined using 250 mL shake flasks. During growth of S. aureus acetate and pyruvate accumulated in culture medium. Biomass formation in B. cepacia and P. aeruginosa cultivations could be increased by addition of sodium acetate as an additional carbon source. A scale-up for the model organisms was carried out from shake flask scale into a 2 L stirred tank reactor (STR) using exhaust gas analysis for calculation of oxygen transfer rate (OTR), carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR) and respiratory quotient (RQ). Pure culture cultivations in the STR showed less biomass formation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus compared to shake flask experiments. OTR- and RQ-characteristics indicated metabolic differences between the model organisms. A continuous cultivation set up was established as a standard procedure for cultivation of a defined mixed culture. The inoculation strategy showed reproducible results for cultivations.
