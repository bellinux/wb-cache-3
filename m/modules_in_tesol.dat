Information about developments may arrive in sporadically, in discontinuous spurts, and they may not be sure about the accuracy of the picture they are getting, or about how they should be teaching. This paper is a personal attempt to trace important developments and issues <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> over the last 25 years, and to suggest ways in which these can affect the performance of the classroom EFL teacher. A number of important recent developments and issues discussed here, including the analysis of language (particularly in ESP) and the teaching of grammar, task-based learning, second language acquisition, and Critical Pedagogy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an impact study of a short teacher training course in teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). Impact is conceptualised as teacher learning, particularly perceived achievements in learning, evidenced in the ways teachers talk about their work <b>in</b> <b>TESOL.</b> The theoretical framework for the research draws on sociocultural theories of learning, particularly situated learning theory and identity formation within communities of practice. In making these links and relating them to a specific programme for teachers <b>in</b> <b>TESOL,</b> this article furthers understanding of how teachers learn in a preservice course in ways which translate to readiness for work. The analysis of interview data from 27 novice teachers in their first months at work reflects a positive and intense learning experience on the course, which establishes both confidence and {{a clear idea of}} what the TESOL task involves. The authors relate these findings in the data to the construct of furnished imagination: the combination of knowledge, procedural awareness and skills, dispositions, and identity which the teachers take from the course as the conceptual toolkit for work <b>in</b> <b>TESOL.</b> The imagination is furnished through the intense, iterated cycles of input, observation, performance, and feedback as well as through interactions with admired teacher educators...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls, 2013. ii + 173 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 155 - 173). Comics, in {{the form}} of comic strips, comic books, and single panel cartoons are ubiquitous in classroom materials for teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). While comics material is widely accepted as a teaching aid <b>in</b> <b>TESOL,</b> there is relatively little research into why comics are popular as a teaching instrument and how the effectiveness of comics can be maximized <b>in</b> <b>TESOL.</b> This thesis is designed {{to bridge the gap between}} conventional wisdom on the use of comics in ESL/EFL instruction and research related to visual aids in learning and language acquisition. The hidden science behind comics use <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> is examined to reveal the nature of comics, the psychological impact of the medium on learners, the qualities that make some comics more educational than others, and the most empirically sound ways to use comics in education. The definition of the comics medium itself is explored; characterizations of comics created by TESOL professionals, comic scholars, and psychologists are indexed and analyzed. This definition is followed by a look at the current role of comics in society at large, the teaching community <b>in</b> general, and <b>TESOL</b> specifically. From there, this paper explores the psycholinguistic concepts of construction of meaning and the language faculty. Through an analysis of the evolution of language, art history, and the psychology of perception, comics are revealed to be an innate form of human communication that originated in pre-literate ancient times; this medium continues to be a powerful form of non-verbal communication to this day. Next, educational theories particularly relevant to comics use <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> are examined, with a focus Allan Pavio's Dual Coding theory of learning and Stephen Krashen's Input and Affective Filter Hypotheses. Each major section of this thesis contains a subsection of case studies from TESOL fieldwork, followed by an index of the things teachers should know and do to use the information in the section effectively...|$|R

40|$|Australian teacher {{education}} programmes that prepare teachers of English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) are confronting {{the nexus of}} two facets of globalization: transformations in the Asian region, captured {{in the notion of}} the "Asian century", and shifting conceptions of professionalism <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> <b>in</b> non-compulsory education. In booming Asian economies, English language learning is integral to the demand for high-quality education. This has produced increases <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> Teacher Education Programme (TTEP) enrolments of both domestic Australian students and international students from Asia. Growth in demand for TTEPs has necessitated that they cater to student diversity, and the intended contexts of practice. This demand has coincided with a concurrent movement towards professional standards for TESOL that, we argue, confronts complexities around quality, accountability, and professional identity and achieving conceptual and contextual coherence. Drawing on discourses of managerialism and performativity, this paper explores tensions between increased student demands for TTEPs, professional standards discourses which are part of the global policy discourses on teacher quality, and the achievement of programmatic conceptual and contextual coherence from the perspective of Australian TTEPs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on CT to examine the opposing arguments for and against having CT instruction <b>in</b> <b>TESOL,</b> <b>in</b> general, and Iranâ€™s ELT curriculum, in particular.

Then, three stances towards the argument of having CT instruction <b>in</b> <b>TESOL</b> are interpreted and discussed: 1) arguments against, 2) arguments in favor, and (3) somewhere in the middle. The third stance is justified to be preferable for Iranâ€™s ELT curriculum in which there is a mismatch between what the policy makers are pursuing and what the teachers and learners need and desire; the policy makers and curriculum planners are after social, cultural, and political conformity whereas the teachers and learners may not necessarily accept what is imposed in the curriculum. This study proposes that CT instruction can be included in Iranâ€™s ELT curriculum but with caution and with respect to the learnersâ€™ sociocultural background and context of use. Finally, some implications are proposed and discussed for policy makers and curriculum planners, teachers, and learners...|$|R
