5|$|Oliphant's {{group at}} Birmingham worked on {{developing}} two promising devices, the klystron and the <b>magnetron.</b> Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity <b>magnetron.</b> By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , {{just the kind of}} short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on <b>magnetron</b> development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity <b>magnetron</b> on 23 July 1942. Their <b>magnetron</b> was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Finder No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army {{cancelled}} {{the order}} in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction Finder. He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a <b>magnetron,</b> producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original <b>magnetron</b> that generated 25centimetre microwave radiation. These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

Camille's son, Henri Gutton, was with the Compagnie Générale de Télégraphie Sans Fil (CSF) where he and Robert Warneck improved his father's <b>magnetrons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the <b>magnetron</b> into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his {{parabolic}} antennas to the <b>magnetron</b> with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{he worked}} in the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney, where he {{produced}} a laboratory model of a cavity <b>magnetron.</b> In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons for radar sets. In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the <b>magnetron,</b> which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The <b>magnetron</b> was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E
50|$|Shigeru Nakajima at Japan Radio Company (JRC) saw a {{commercial}} potential {{of these devices}} and began the further development and subsequent very profitable production of <b>magnetrons</b> for the medical dielectric heating (diathermy) market.

Single or chronic exposure {{can lead to}} berylliosis, an incurable lung condition. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or <b>magnetrons</b> should not be directly handled.|$|R
5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity <b>magnetron</b> in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity <b>magnetron,</b> a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity <b>magnetron</b> at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC {{was told}} {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They {{introduced}} new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E

40|$|<b>Magnetrons</b> are {{low-cost}} highly-efficient microwave sources, {{but they}} have several limitations, primarily centered about the phase and frequency stability of their output. When the stability requirements are low, such as for medical accelerators or kitchen ovens, <b>magnetrons</b> are the very efficient power source of choice. But for high energy accelerators, {{because of the need}} for frequency and phase stability - proton accelerators need 1 - 2 degrees source phase stability, and electron accelerators need. 1 -. 2 degrees of phase stability - they have rarely been used. We describe a novel variable frequency cavity technique which will be utilized to phase and frequency lock <b>magnetrons...</b>|$|R
50|$|Research on cavity <b>magnetrons</b> was {{conducted}} by another institute at Kharkov in Ukraine. In 1936, one of these <b>magnetrons</b> {{was used by the}} NII-9 in building a radioiskatel (radio-seeker) called Burya (Storm). Although he had earlier used pulsed transmission in ionospheres experiments, Bonch-Bruevich strongly believed in the potential of continuous-wave (CW) transmission for radio-location, and led the use of this technology in Burya.|$|R
5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of the cavity <b>magnetron</b> in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a television receiver, was used as the basis of the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other radar systems throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the <b>magnetron</b> to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{secured the}} {{services}} of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey, {{who had been working}} for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity <b>magnetron.</b> This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of the}} Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project, and had Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on the project, and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.|$|E
50|$|When <b>magnetrons</b> {{were being}} {{developed}} in Japan, the initial primary application {{was intended to}} be power transmission, not radar. As these devices increased in output energy, their application for a weapon became apparent. For research in special weapons, a large facility was built in Shimada. In 1943, a project in developing a Ku-go (Death Ray) using <b>magnetrons</b> began. By the end of the war, <b>magnetrons</b> developing 100 kW continuous power at 75 cm (400 MHz) had been built, and the intent was apparently to couple 10 of these to produce a beam of 1,000 kW. Essentially all of the equipment and documents at Shimada were destroyed before the Americans reached the facility.|$|R

40|$|Until {{the present}} work, {{experience}} with repetitive relativistic <b>magnetrons</b> was sparse, consisting of- 1 Hz cooled devices and 100 Hz bursts in uncooled resonators (13) • The highest average power reported is approximately 500 W.

Earlier single shot operation produces RF energies exceeding 50 Joules per micropulse. We have achieved 40 Joules r micropulse at a repetition rate of 100 Herz, or an average power of 4 kW for 0. 5 seconds. In this paper we discuss issues in interfacing <b>magnetrons</b> with repetitive pulsed power and the operating characterisflcs during a burst of pulses. ...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity <b>magnetron.</b> In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, {{and they}} {{attempted}} {{to persuade him to}} join the Los Alamos Laboratory, but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project. Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity <b>magnetron.</b> This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His requests for personnel were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.|$|E
