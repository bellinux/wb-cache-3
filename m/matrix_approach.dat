25|$|The assay is scalable, {{which makes}} it {{possible}} to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the <b>matrix</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{high-throughput}} {{approach is}} the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the <b>matrix</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E

In the <b>matrix</b> <b>approach,</b> a series of conductors are arranged {{in an array of}} parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid. [...] A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array. [...] The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received [...] awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} finite method {{can be traced}} to the matrix {{analysis}} of structures [...] where the concept of a displacement or stiffness <b>matrix</b> <b>approach</b> was introduced.

The original works such as those by Argyris [...] and Clough [...] became the foundation for today’s finite element structural analysis methods. Earlier books such as by Zienkiewicz [...] and more recent books such as by Yang [...] give comprehensive summary of developments in finite-element structural analysis. Implementing the method in software is described in the classic text by Smith, Griffiths and Margetts.|$|E
