40|$|The {{concentration}} of IgG and IgA {{was measured in}} the supernatants of peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> and of cells harvested from the intestinal lamina propria, which were cultured in vitro in {{the presence or absence}} of mitogens. The lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> were harvested by collagenase digestion of macroscopically normal mucosa from 10 fresh surgical resections for carcinoma. Secretion of IgA in cultures of unstimulated lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> greatly exceeded that of IgG. The addition of pokeweed mitogen increased Ig secretion by cultures of peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> but decreased Ig secretion by lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> The addition of concanavalin A suppressed Ig synthesis by pokeweed mitogen stimulated cells more in cultures of peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> than in lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> Cycloheximide inhibited Ig secretion by more than 90 % in cultures of peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells,</b> but there was less inhibition in cultures of lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> In the four unstimulated cultures of lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> examined, over 75 % of the Ig was secreted in the first three to four days of culture. The results indicate that lamina propria <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> are refractory to the inductive and suppressive signals of mitogens, and represent an activated cell population which is committed to Ig secretion before being cultured...|$|R

40|$|Production of the {{chemotactic}} {{factor for}} granulocytes (CFG) by human <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> was studied using the agarose plate method. CFG {{was produced by}} <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> placed in an agarose well, and a chemotactic gradient was formed in the surrounding area. The degree of CFG production by <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> was estimated by the chemotactic response of indicator granulocytes which were placed in separated agarose wells in the same dish. CFG production was observed after 3 h culture in a well where LPS or anti-beta 2 microglobulin serum stimulated <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> were placed. CFG did not show chemotactic activity for monocytes. PHA, Con A, PWM and Sepharose-Protein A failed to activate <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> to produce significant amounts of CFG compared with non-stimulated cells. There was a dose-response relationship between the chemotactic activity of the CFG produced {{and the number of}} phagocytic <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> in well culture.

40|$|Summary. -The primary {{reaction}} of the macrophage electrophoretic mobility test (MEM) and its modifications (viz. the interaction of myelin basic protein (MBP) and <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells)</b> has been investigated. The binding of MBP to <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> is rather weak, and on incubation with <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> the MBP is proteolytically degraded. A fast process leads to fragments with mol. wts in the range 9000 - 14, 000, followed by a slower process leading to peptides smaller than 5000. Both binding and proteolytic degradation are the same for <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> from cancer patients and from control individuals. The macrophage electrophoretic mobility (MEM) test was introduced in 1970 as a method {{for the detection of}} cancer (Field & Caspary, 1970). The procedure can be described briefly as follows.

40|$|Incubation of {{neutrophils}} or <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> with washed platelets (all prepared {{from human}} venous blood) {{resulted in an}} inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation that was dependent {{on the number of}} nucleated cells added. The inhibition was potentiated by superoxide dismutase and reversed by oxyhemoglobin. In the case of neutrophils the inhibition was associated with an increase in cGMP, whereas with <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> both cAMP and cGMP were increased. The inhibitory activity of neutrophils or <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> was prevented by their preincubation with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine methyl ester. L-Arginine reversed the action of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine methyl ester, whereas D-arginine was ineffective. Preincubation of the cells with catalase or mannitol did not prevent their inhibitory action on platelet aggregation. The inhibition of platelet aggregation was not due to platelet damage or to uptake of thrombin by neutrophils or <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> It was overcome by increasing the concentration of thrombin and was absent in cell-free supernatants obtained from a suspension of neutrophils or <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> or from mixtures of platelets with neutrophils or platelets with <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> These data provide evidence for the release of a nitric oxide-like factor from human neutrophils and <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, evidence is provided that, as in stimulated murine macrophages and endothelial cells, the precursor of this factor is L-arginine...|$|R

40|$|Arachidonic acid (AA), a {{fatty acid}} {{found in the}} human bone marrow plasma, is the {{precursor}} of eicosanoids that modulate bone marrow haematopoiesis. To further {{our understanding of the}} role of AA in the bone marrow physiology, we have assessed its incorporation in human bone marrow <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> Gas chromatography analysis indicates the presence of AA in their fatty acid composition. In bone marrow <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells,</b> [3 H]-AA is incorporated into triglycerides and is later delivered into phospholipids, a result not observed with blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells.</b> Prelabelling-chase experiments indicate a trafficking of labelled AA from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine. Stimulation of prelabelled bone marrow <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) results in the release of a part of the incorporated labelled AA. Finally, exogenous AA (up to 1 microM) has no significant effect on cell growth. In conclusion, human bone marrow <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> participate to the control of marrow AA concentrations by incorporating AA into phospholipids and triglycerides. In turn, bone marrow <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> can release AA in response to the potent haematopoietic growth factor GM-CSF...|$|R

The ability of collagenase supernatants to kill 51 Cr-labelled peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> over four hours was assessed in 16 collagenase supernatants, eight of which produced lysis of 20 +/- 4 %. There was no ultrastructural evidence of early degenerative changes in the viable intestinal <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> fresh from the isolation process or in peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> incubated in collagenase supernatant.
