5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian <b>magnetosphere</b> mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer <b>magnetosphere</b> shows some features of a solar wind-driven <b>magnetosphere,</b> including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn <b>magnetosphere</b> contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk <b>magnetosphere,</b> the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian <b>magnetosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle <b>magnetosphere,</b> at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer <b>magnetosphere)</b> this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the <b>magnetosphere</b> through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer <b>magnetosphere.</b> This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner <b>magnetosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the <b>magnetosphere</b> with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the <b>magnetosphere</b> on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the <b>magnetosphere,</b> which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

Theories of <b>magnetospheres</b> around accreting compact objects are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Solar system <b>magnetospheres</b> can {{be divided}} into two groups: induced and intrinsic. The induced <b>magnetospheres</b> are {{produced}} in the solar wind interaction of the magnetized solar wind with planetary obstacles. Examples of these <b>magnetospheres</b> are those of comets, Venus and Mars. Intrinsic <b>magnetospheres</b> are the cavities formed in the solar wind by the magnetic fields produced by dynamo current systems inside the planets: Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are known to have intrinsic <b>magnetospheres.</b> Intrinsic <b>magnetospheres</b> can be further subdivided as to how the circulating plasma is driven by external or internal processes. The <b>magnetospheres</b> of Mercury and Earth are driven by the solar wind. The <b>magnetospheres</b> of Jupiter and possibly of Saturn are principally driven by internal processes. These processes provide the energy for the powerful jovian radio signals that can be detected easily {{on the surface of the}} Earth...|$|R

5|$|Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> is {{a complex}} {{structure}} comprising a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, magnetotail, magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's <b>magnetosphere.</b> The <b>magnetosphere</b> is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> is {{traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer <b>magnetosphere.</b> The inner <b>magnetosphere</b> is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E
5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} <b>magnetosphere</b> begins {{to slow the}} solar wind, occurs at a {{distance}} of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the <b>magnetosphere</b> counterbalances the solar wind, lies {{at a distance of}} 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the <b>magnetosphere</b> extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E
40|$|Space-probe {{observations}} of planetary <b>magnetospheres</b> are discussed. Three different categories of planetary <b>magnetospheres</b> are identified (intrinsic slowly rotating, intrinsic rapidly rotating, and induced), and {{the characteristics of}} each type are outlined. The structure and physical processes of the <b>magnetospheres</b> of Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter are described, and possible configurations are presented for the Martian and Jovian ones. Expected magnetic moments are derived for Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Models are constructed for possible induced <b>magnetospheres</b> of the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Io...|$|R
50|$|In {{rotating}} <b>magnetospheres</b> the {{centrifugal force}} acts differently in different locations, leading to generation of Langmuir waves, or plasma oscillations via the parametric instability.

50|$|The {{study of}} planets also {{includes}} <b>magnetospheres</b> and ionospheres. The origin {{of their respective}} magnetic fields, magnetospheric plasma and radiation belts is also of interest. Included {{in this area is}} the interaction of <b>magnetospheres</b> and ionospheres with the sun, solar wind, and their natural satellites.|$|R
5|$|Saturn has an {{intrinsic}} magnetic field {{that has a}} simple, symmetric shape – a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator – 0.2gauss (20µT) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's <b>magnetosphere</b> is much smaller than Jupiter's. When Voyager 2 entered the <b>magnetosphere,</b> the solar wind pressure was high and the <b>magnetosphere</b> extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days. Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This <b>magnetosphere</b> is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's <b>magnetosphere</b> and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's <b>magnetosphere,</b> like Earth's, produces aurorae.|$|E
5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the plasma into the co-rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the kinetic energy of the plasma. In that sense, the Jovian <b>magnetosphere</b> is powered by the planet's rotation, whereas the Earth's <b>magnetosphere</b> is powered mainly by the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the <b>magnetosphere.</b> Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the <b>magnetosphere,</b> to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside <b>magnetosphere</b> into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside <b>magnetosphere</b> within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the <b>magnetosphere.</b>|$|E

The possibility of magneto-gravitational capture of these gains by <b>magnetospheres,</b> to form dust rings around the planets, is also discussed. Finally, the possible break-up of grains charged to large electrical potentials and its consequences are briefly addressed...|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} between the Ganymedian <b>magnetosphere</b> and Jovian plasma is in many respects {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's <b>magnetosphere.</b> The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian <b>magnetosphere</b> much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's <b>magnetosphere.</b> The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} of the Jovian <b>magnetosphere</b> with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons. Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere.</b> Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its <b>magnetosphere.</b> It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field lines are open. Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts. Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere {{are responsible for the}} observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>magnetosphere</b> of Jupiter is {{the cavity}} {{created in the}} solar wind by the planet's {{magnetic}} field. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction, Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> is {{the largest and most}} powerful of any planetary <b>magnetosphere</b> in the Solar System, and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Wider and flatter than the Earth's <b>magnetosphere,</b> Jupiter's is stronger by an order of magnitude, while its magnetic moment is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973.|$|E
40|$|The <b>magnetospheres</b> of {{the outer}} planets have been shown by Voyager explorations to {{strongly}} interact with the surfaces and atmospheres of their planetary satellites and rings.

5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian <b>magnetosphere</b> is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer <b>magnetosphere</b> at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian <b>magnetosphere,</b> centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer <b>magnetosphere.</b> The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the <b>magnetosphere</b> of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner <b>magnetosphere.</b> These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer <b>magnetosphere.</b> In the middle <b>magnetosphere,</b> Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer <b>magnetosphere</b> impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E
5|$|Titania's orbit lies {{completely}} {{inside the}} Uranian <b>magnetosphere.</b> This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a <b>magnetosphere</b> are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet.

5|$|As with Earth's <b>magnetosphere,</b> the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's <b>magnetosphere</b> {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the <b>magnetosphere.</b> The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E

The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries.
