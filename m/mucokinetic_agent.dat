40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating lung disease of unknown etiology. Its pathogenesis remains poorly elucidated but aberrant wound healing {{is central to}} its pathology. It has a median survival time of 3 to 5 years. None of the treatment modality or drugs tried in its management has so far changed the overall outcome. Recent in vitro and experimental {{studies have shown that}} ambroxol hydrochloride exerts several newer actions, namely the surfactant stimulatory, anti-imflammatory and anti-oxidant actions, in addition to its being a secrrtolytic and <b>mucokinetic</b> <b>agent.</b> The anti inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of the drug are due to its ability to block the release of oxidant stress markers, cytokines, leukotrienes, MPO activity, hydroxyproline content, nitic oxide and/or collagen I & III mRNA in the local milieu while preserving the SOD and GSH-PX activities. In human studies also, the agent was able to block the expression of TGF-beta and TNF-alpha in plasma and preserving the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of the lungs in lung cancer patients on radiation therapy. Thus, ambroxol may have the potential to check the dysregulated healing process that is typical of IPF. This, coupled with its safety profile for human use, warrants clinical trials of the drug in the management of IPF...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory {{diseases}} of the respiratory tract are characterized by changes in rheological properties of the phlegm and lower of the mucociliary clearance. Adjustment of mucoregulatory agents is of a special significance in treatment of {{diseases of}} the lower respiratory tract in children. Aim: to assess efficacy of carbocysteine lysine salt monohydrate as a <b>mucokinetic</b> <b>agent</b> in children with respiratory tract diseases. Patients and methods : 65 children (31 girls and 34 boys) aged from 5 to 16 years old with acute respiratory tract diseases received treatment in Belgorod pediatric out-patient clinic №  4 were included into the study. The results of the clinical follow-up of these children are shown in the article. Results : carbocysteine lysine salt monohydrate {{was found to be}} effective and safe in treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory {{diseases of the}} respiratory tract in children. The authors observed quicker convalescence of the patients and possibility of combination of this drug with other medicines used in pediatric practice. Conclusions : the above-mentioned drug when used in combination with antibacterial agents intensifies penetration of the latter into the bronchial secretion and bronchial mucous membrane thereby increasing their efficacy. The drug does not have toxicity, is well-tolerated even when prolonged using and can be recommended for treatment of cough in children both under out- and in-patients conditions. Keywords : children, respiratory tract diseases, carbocysteine. </p...|$|E
30|$|For cough to be {{effective}} there must be sufficient airflow to detach sputum from the epithelium and to mobilize secretions {{so that they can}} be expectorated. <b>Mucokinetic</b> <b>agents</b> improve the cough clearance of secretions, either by increasing airflow or by altering the sputum-epithelium interaction. By this definition, bronchodilators can be considered <b>mucokinetic</b> <b>agents</b> but only in patients who have a significant improvement in airflow with bronchodilator therapy.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} orally {{administered}} drugs on rheologic properties of nasal mucus were investigated in adult chronic sinusitis patients. The elastic modulus G' and the dynamic viscosity η' of nasal mucus {{were determined by}} an oscillating sphere magnetic rheometer. Both G' and η' values of the mucus before drug administration were much higher than optimal viscoelasticity for mucocilliary transport. Norfloxacin, an antibacterial agent, reduced the G' but not the η'. The results indicate {{that some of the}} orally administered <b>mucokinetic</b> <b>agents</b> can improve the abnormal rheologic properties of nasal mucus in chronic sinusitis...|$|R
