50|$|Another {{well-known}} Kurdish rug is the Senneh rug, {{which is}} regarded as the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs. They are especially known for their great knot density and high quality <b>mountain</b> <b>wool.</b> They lend their name from the region of Sanandaj. Throughout other Kurdish regions like Kermanshah, Siirt, Malatya and Bitlis rugs were also woven to great extent.|$|E

5000|$|The fur of the Salish Wool Dog was prized {{for making}} the famous and rare [...] "Salish" [...] blankets, as the Salish peoples did not have sheep and wild <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> was {{difficult}} to gather. The dogs were sheared like sheep in May or June. The sheared fur was so thick that Captain George Vancouver could pick up a corner and the whole fleece would hold together. Ceremonial blankets were prized items in the precontact potlatch distribution economic system, almost as valuable as slaves. The dog hair was frequently mixed with <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> feathers, and plant fibers to change the yarn quality and to extend the supply of fiber.|$|R
50|$|Crossing {{between the}} glaciers and cliffs {{on the crest}} of the mountains, they descended through the tall forests {{to the land of the}} Skagit tribes. The Chelan Indians often traded <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> for dried clams and salmon, or for seashells, which they used for future trade or ornamentation.|$|R
50|$|The Salish used <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> or SAH-ay, as {{the main}} source of fiber for weaving. Blankets made from goat hair were the most valuable. Originally, the Salish {{obtained}} wool high in the mountains where the mountain goats spent their summers and shed their old wool. Wool might be found caught or tangled in low bushes. During this season, they would also save wool acquired from goats killed for food. They would roll up the skin with flesh sides together and after several days, the wool would shed naturally. Then it was plucked off to be made into yarn. Before the raw fiber was spun into workable threads, it was mixed with a white chalk-like clay, absorbing the grease allowing the wool fibers to cling together. Domestic sheep wool has now fully replaced <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> which is rare and difficult to obtain.|$|R
50|$|Growing in many areas, Indian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum) was {{harvested}} {{and dried}} before maturity. The grass was boiled to render them soft and pliable. Whenever used for weaving, the fibers were kept moist. Indian hemp {{was used by}} the Salish speaking people near Spuzzum on the Fraser River, as a foundation warp material. On the grass warp, the blanket of soft dog's hair or <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> was woven.|$|R
5000|$|Before European {{contact the}} Coast Salish peoples, {{including}} the Cowichan, wove blankets, leggings, and tumplines out of <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> dog hair, and other fibres. [...] The wool was spun with a spindle and whorl, and the blankets were woven on a two-bar loom. There is little information on pre-contact production {{and use of}} these weavings, although examples remain in museum collections. No archaeological or ethnographic evidence of knitting or knitting needles exists.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to collecting <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> the Salish kept (mostly white) woolly dogs {{to use their}} fur as weaving fibers. In a 1792 log, Captain George Vancouver wrote that [...] "The dogs belonging to this tribe...were numerous, and resembled those Pomerania, though in general somewhat larger. They were all shorn {{as close to the}} skin as sheep are in England; and so compact were their fleeces, that large portions could be lifted up by a corner without causing any separation." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are five}} known types of Salish spindles. [...] The version used {{exclusively}} by the Cowichan people was {{very large and}} was used for spinning two ply <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> and dog hair for weaving. The spindle was a tapered shaft approximately four feet long. The whorl, which rested one-half to {{two-thirds of the way}} down the shaft, was about eight inches in diameter. Coast Salish spindle whorls were often highly decorated, and many fine examples can be found in museum collections.|$|R
60|$|What {{a glorious}} day it was, and what spirits it put {{everybody}} in! The sun shone with an intensity almost torrid; {{the spot on}} which they had landed was green and bright, like a slice out of the realms of Fairy-land. No zephyr dared to disturb the leaves or the glassy water; great clouds hung in the bright blue sky--rotund, fat, and heavy, like <b>mountains</b> of <b>wool</b> or butter. Everything in nature seemed to have gone to sleep at noon, as if Spanish principles had suddenly imbued the universe.|$|R
5000|$|Rofkar learned weaving {{from her}} {{grandmother}} Eliza Monk, {{as well as}} Delores Churchill (Haida), Ernestine Hanlon-Abel (Tlingit) and Cheryl Samuel. She began her professional career as a weaver in 1986. She wove the first Tlingit robe made completely from <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> {{in more than two}} hundred years, but also worked with contemporary materials and technology. In 2004, Rofkar won the Governor’s Award for Native Art in Alaska. She was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts [...] "Living Treasures" [...] fellowship in 2009. In 2013, she received the Distinguished Artist Award from the Rasmuson Foundation.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the sign}} of {{reaching}} this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father. [...] The father would call together the family and relatives. [...] They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow. [...] Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In {{one example of the}} tradition, the family would take two strands of <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead. [...] The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age.|$|R
50|$|Jennie {{made more}} than fifty {{blankets}} and twenty five tunics in her seventy-five-year-long career. Jennie was a prolific weaver and while traditionally a Chilkat blanket would take a full-time year to finish, Jennie was able to finish so many blankets while preserving subsistence foods, holding down a job and raising her children. Jennie sold some of her work but much of her work was given as gifts to her family. Chilkat blankets are traditionally woven with <b>mountain</b> goats <b>wool</b> (dyed with tree lichens, oxidized copper and urine steeped hemlock bark) and red cedar bark. Men traditionally provided the materials for the weavings and the women prepared the materials and made the weavings. Jennie spun all of her own yarn in the traditional way, twisting the wool against her leg.|$|R
2500|$|Sharing wealth {{was highly}} {{regarded}} and practiced by most high-ranking and wealthy families. This {{distribution of wealth}} is {{a key component of}} the potlatch gift-giving festival, and was encouraged through the display of values celebrated in the culture such as generosity, humility and respect. [...] Some families were considered nobility because of their connection to spiritual powers or ceremonialism. Shamans, prophet’s and medicine doctors were considered nobility because of the training and expertise they possessed. [...] Some jobs or positions held by members of the community also signified members of this class. [...] These positions were often related to the mountain goat, like hunting or the weaving of <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool</b> blankets. [...] One's class was not always predetermined and set for life under this system, and before European contact commoners or slaves had the ability to sometimes rise through the ranks to one day reach a higher class designation.|$|R
50|$|Chilkat weaving {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex weaving {{techniques}} in the world. It is unique in that the artist can create curvilinear and circular forms within the weave itself. A Chilkat blanket can take a year to weave. Traditionally <b>mountain</b> goat <b>wool,</b> dog fur, and yellow cedar bark are used in Chilkat weaving. Today sheep wool might be used. The designs used Northwest Coast formlines, a traditional aesthetic language made up of ovoid, U-form, and S-form elements to create highly stylized, but representational, clan crests and figures from oral history—often animals and especially their facial features. Yellow and black are dominant colors in the weavings, as is the natural buff color of the undyed wool. Blue can be a secondary color.Looms used in Chilkat weaving only have a top frame and vertical supports, with no bottom frame, so the warp threads hang freely. The weaver works in vertical sections, as opposed to moving horizontally from end to end. Consequently, many designs are broken into vertical columns. As with most Northwest Coast art, these columns are bilaterally symmetrical.|$|R
50|$|The Polish Tatra Sheepdog, which {{sometimes}} {{goes by the}} Owczarek Podhalanski and the Polish Mountain Sheepdog, originated in Podhale, in the Tatra Mountain area of Poland, hence the breed's name. The breed {{has lived in the}} Polish mountains for thousands of years, but no exact date {{for the start of the}} breed was ever recorded. There is a similar mystery around what breeds were mixed to form the Polish Tatra Sheepdog. While no one is certain, many dog breeders say that the Polish Tatra Sheepdog came from the Mastiff breed. The breed was very popular among mountain workers for several centuries, and up to today. It was so popular because, as its name implies, it was a fantastic sheepdog. This success at herding sheep was mainly due to their high intelligence. When predators were around the sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog would gather up the sheep and stand by them instead of trying to attack the predator, which would leave the sheep open for other attacks. This demonstrates their intelligence. Their white coat also made them easily distinguishable from a bear or wolves, which was very helpful for workers. Also, owners could shave the dogs and use their coat to produce <b>wool.</b> <b>Mountain</b> workers also used to hold their tails while they lead the workers through the mountains and rough terrain. Herding sheep was not the only job the breed could perform. They were often used as personal guards and frequently guarded factories and other private property. On top of this, it was often the case that the breed was used by the police force. The breed faced some hard times, though. After the World Wars the breed was on the brink of extinction. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale, (FCI), would not allow this to happen, though, and by the 1960s they started breeding the sheepdog more and more. Centuries ago, as their reputation as excellent sheepdogs spread, the breed spread slowly across Europe, but in 1980, an American Foreign Service Officer enjoyed the breed so much that he had three of them shipped to America, and by 1981 the breed also spread to Canada.|$|R
