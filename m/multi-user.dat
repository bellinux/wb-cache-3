5|$|Word {{was first}} {{released}} {{in the spring of}} 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of PC World, making it the first program to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it (note that Unix is a <b>multi-user</b> operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had gotten out of the Unix business, except for an interest in SCO.|$|E
5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on <b>multi-user</b> mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open <b>multi-user</b> environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Multi-users</b> Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission method [1] is {{used for}} {{reducing}} the data overhead of Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) in the Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) context. In the <b>Multi-users</b> Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission method, voice packets from different users having the same Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) can be clustered into one same LTE packet in the downlink transmission for reducing the data overhead caused by {{the difference between the}} LTE packet size and the PMR voice payload. However, in order to increase the voice capacity of VoLTE in PMR context both data overhead and control overhead have to be reduced. Therefore, in this paper, we will present a new Group Radio Network Identifier (Group RNTI) method for reducing the control overhead in the multiplexing scheme. In the Group RNTI method, UEs having the same Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) will be clustered in one or more groups. Each group is assigned a common Group RNTI. Control information is sent for groups rather than for each UE. The results show that the Group RNTI can reduce the control signaling up to 85 % compared to the fully dynamic scheduling (FD) in the standard LTE in case of using <b>Multi-users</b> Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission method. The use of Group RNTI for the <b>Multi-users</b> Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission method allows reducing both data overhead and control overhead issues for VoLTE in PMR context. The proposed method ensures an augmentation of voice capacity and a reduction of blocking rate for VoLTE in PMR contex...|$|R

30|$|System {{resource}} management in MIMO-OFDM is more flexible {{both in the}} third- and the fourth-generation mobile communication technology. This is crucial for resource allocation in slot times and frequency channels of <b>multi-users.</b> As to {{resource management}} in cognitive MIMO-OFDM, the combined technique is capable to allocate power and bit number in slot times and frequency channels based {{on the needs of}} main users and secondary users. In the next-generation mobile communication system binding MIMO-OFDM techniques, the use of available wireless resource could be extended from one dimension to multidimension. Based on cross layer design after considering quality of service requirements of <b>multi-users,</b> the next-generation system would employ alterable code rate in transmitting end, multifold modulation system, variable power, and adaptable system channel bandwidth. It would adaptively manage complex wireless resource allocation through adding or removing of multiple sending and receiving antennas or various collections of antennas. Therefore, dynamic resource management of MIMO-OFDM is essential to enhance the system’s spectrum efficiency.|$|R
