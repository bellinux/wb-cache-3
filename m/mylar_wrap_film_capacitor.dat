25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is relatively high compared to other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> types.|$|R

25|$|Polyphenylene sulfide <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are well-suited for {{applications}} in frequency-determining circuits and for high-temperature applications. Because of their good electrical properties, PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are an ideal replacement for polycarbonate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> whose production since 2000 {{has been largely}} discontinued.|$|R
25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>{{capacitors}}</b> {{or plastic}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric. The dielectric films {{are drawn to}} a thin layer, provided with metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or {{both sides of the}} plastic film, resulting in metallized <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> or a separate metallic foil overlying the <b>film,</b> called film/foil <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Polystyrene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Styroflex Capacitors", were {{well known for}} many years as inexpensive <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10nbsp&µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85nbsp&°C, the PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have mostly been replaced by polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.|$|R
25|$|In 1984, a new <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{technology}} that {{makes use of}} vacuum-deposited electron-beam cross-linked acrylate materials as dielectric in <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> was announced as a patent in the press. But as of 2012, only one manufacturer markets a specific acrylate SMD <b>film</b> <b>capacitor,</b> as an X7R MLCC replacement.|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} capacitance of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> over the entire temperature range is very small (±nbsp&1.5%) compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Also the frequency dependence {{in the range from}} 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz of the capacitance of the PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is ±nbsp&0.5%, very low compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The dissipation factor of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is quite small, and the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor over a wide range is very stable. Only at temperatures above 100nbsp&°C does the dissipation factor increase to larger values. The dielectric absorption performance is excellent, behind only PTFE and PS dielectric capacitors.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} capacitance of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> over the entire temperature range is very small (± 1.5%) compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Also the frequency dependence {{in the range from}} 100 Hz to 100 kHz of the capacitance of the PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is ± 0.5%, very low compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The dissipation factor of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is quite small, and the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor over a wide range is very stable.

25|$|These {{capacitors}} {{have a low}} {{dissipation factor}} and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about ±80nbsp&ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of polycarbonate <b>film</b> for <b>capacitors</b> had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of polycarbonate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> worldwide had to stop their production of PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> and changed to polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> instead. Most of the former PC capacitor applications have found satisfactory substitutes with PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are made}} out of two pieces of plastic film covered with {{metallic}} electrodes, wound into a cylindrical shaped winding, with terminals attached, and then encapsulated. In general, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are not polarized, so the two terminals are interchangeable. There are {{two different types of}} plastic <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> made with two different electrode configurations: ...|$|R
25|$|A related type is {{the power}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The {{materials}} and construction techniques used for large power <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> mostly {{are similar to those}} of ordinary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.|$|R
25|$|From simple {{beginnings}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{developed into}} a very broad and highly specialized range of different types. By {{the end of the}} 20th century mass production of most <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had shifted to the Far East. A few large companies still produce highly specialized <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in Europe and in the US, for power and AC applications.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650nbsp&V/µm, PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are used in AC power applications, such as motor run capacitors or PFC capacitors.|$|R
2500|$|Two main {{advantages}} of <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are very low ESR and ESL values. <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are physically {{larger and more}} expensive than aluminum electrolytic capacitors (e-caps), [...] but have much higher surge and pulse load capabilities. As <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are not polarized, {{they can be used}} in AC voltage applications without DC bias, and they have much more stable electrical parameters. Polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have relatively little temperature dependence of capacitance and dissipation factor, {{so that they can be}} applied in frequency-stable Class 1 applications, replacing Class 1 ceramic capacitors.|$|R
25|$|The {{change of}} {{capacitance}} for P100 and N470 Class 1 ceramic capacitors {{is lower than}} 1%, for capacitors with N750 to N1500 ceramics it is ≤2%. <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> may lose capacitance due to self-healing processes or gain it due to humidity influences. Typical changes over 2 years at 40°C are, for example, ±3% for PE <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> and ±1% PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Polyethylene naphthalate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> using a {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic biaxial polymer material polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), {{trade names}} Kaladex®, Teonex®. [...] They are produced only as metallized types. PEN, like PET, belongs to the polyester family, but has better stability at high temperatures. Therefore, PEN <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are more suitable for}} high temperature applications and for SMD packaging.|$|R
25|$|Polyphenylene sulfide <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic, organic, {{and partially}} crystalline polymer material Poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS), trade name Torelina. They are only produced as metallized types.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650 V/µm, PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications.

25|$|Most EMI/RFI {{suppression}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are metallized polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> However, {{some types}} of metallized paper capacitors (MP) are still used for this application, because they still have some advantages in flame resistance.|$|R
25|$|However, since {{almost every}} major {{manufacturer}} offers its own proprietary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with mixed <b>film</b> materials, {{it is difficult}} to give a universal and general overview of the specific properties of mixed <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} and frequency dependencies of electrical parameters for polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are very low. Polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have a linear, {{negative temperature coefficient}} of capacitance of ±2,5 % within their temperature range. Therefore, polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are suitable for applications in Class 1 frequency-determining circuits, filters, oscillator circuits, audio circuits, and timers. They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications, and for high-frequency applications.|$|R
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|R

2500|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{feature a}} very high {{temperature}} resistance up to 200nbsp&°C, and even further up to 260nbsp&°C, with a voltage derating. The dissipation factor 2 • 10 −4 [...] is quite small. The change in capacitance over the entire temperature range of +1% to -3% {{is a little bit}} higher than for polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> However, since the smallest available film thickness for PTFE films is 5.5nbsp&µm, approximately twice of the thickness of polypropylene films, the PTFE <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are physically bulkier than PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> It added that the film thickness on the surface is not constant, so that Teflon films are difficult to produce.|$|R
25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{have become}} much smaller since the {{beginning}} of the technology. Through development of thinner plastic films, for example, the dimensions of metallized polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> were decreased by a factor of approximately 3 to 4.|$|R
25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{with their}} {{different}} plastic film material {{do have a}} small spread in the dimensions for a given capacitance/voltage value of a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> because the minimum dielectric film thickness differs between the different film materials.|$|R

2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> were the {{cellulose}} acetate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized <b>capacitors</b> in paint <b>film</b> thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> of the time. MKU <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are no longer manufactured, because polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|R
