The loop inner diameter is 4 mm. The lower heating section consists of an electrical heating wire made of nicromel {{on the outside of}} the copper tube; the upper cooling system consists of a coaxial cylindrical heat exchanger with a water–glycol mixture, set at controlled temperature and flowing through the annulus. The loop has an imposed heat flux in the lower heating section and an imposed temperature in the cooler. The mini-loop was placed onto a table which can assume different inclinations. The parameters investigated during the experiments were: power transferred to the fluid and inclination of the loop.

40|$|Acoustic {{stimulation}} of the cochlea leads to a travelling wave in the cochlear fluids and on the basilar membrane (BM). It has long been suspected that this travelling wave leads to a steady streaming flow in the cochlea. Theoretical investigations suggested that the steady streaming might be of physiological relevance. Here, we present a quantitative study of the steady streaming in a computational model of a passive cochlea. The structure of the streaming flow is illustrated and the sources of streaming are closely investigated. We describe a source of streaming {{which has not been}} considered in the cochlea by previous authors. This source is also related to a steady axial displacement of the BM which leads to a local stretching of this compliant structure. We present theoretical predictions for the streaming intensity which account for these new phenomena. It is shown that these predictions compare well with our numerical results and that there may be steady streaming velocities of the order of <b>millimetres</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Our results indicate that steady streaming should be more relevant to low-frequency hearing because the strength of the streaming flow rapidly decreases for higher frequencie...|$|E
40|$|Starbugs are {{miniature}} piezoelectric 'walking' robots {{with the}} ability to simultaneously position many optical fibres across a telescope's focal plane. Their simple design incorporates two piezoceramic tubes to form a pair of concentric 'legs' capable of taking individual steps of a few microns, yet with the capacity to move a payload several <b>millimetres</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The Australian Astronomical Observatory has developed this technology to enable fast and accurate field reconfigurations without the inherent limitations of more traditional positioning techniques, such as the 'pick and place' robotic arm. We report on our recent successes in demonstrating Starbug technology, driven principally by R&D efforts for the planned MANIFEST (many instrument fibre-system) facility for the Giant Magellan Telescope. Significant performance gains have resulted from improvements to the Starbug system, including i) the use of a vacuum to attach Starbugs to the underside of a transparent field plate, ii) optimisation of the control electronics, iii) a simplified mechanical design with high sensitivity piezo actuators, and iv) the construction of a dedicated laboratory 'test rig'. A method of reliably rotating Starbugs in steps of several arcminutes has also been devised, which integrates with the pre-existing x-y movement directions and offers greater flexibility while positioning. We present measured performance data from a prototype system of 10 Starbugs under full (closed-loop control), at field plate angles of 0 - 90 degrees. Comment: 14 pages, Proc. SPIE 8450 (2012...|$|E

A combined studies using numerical analyses and practical experiments to calculate the feed limits for different arc energies. Each weld where analysed both mathematical, physical and thru observation. The combined results for one experiment will form the bases for {{the next set of}} experiments. Two feed limits was discovered, one for room temperature metal and one for pre-heated metal. For welding on materials in room temperature, the arc was able to melt the filler, and make a complete fusion with the parent metal, when the energy requirement for melting the filler was under 20 per cent of the total arc energy. For welding on pre-heated metals the energy requirement for the filler was 23 – 24 per cent. The feed limits where tested and confirmed when welding with 2. 6 kJ/s (300 A), 2. 2 kJ/s (250 A) and 1. 6 kJ/s (200 A). Welding at the feed limit, on pre heated metals, produced good welds at arc speed up to 5 <b>millimetres</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Part of the result is a preliminary welding procedure specification for a specific groove based on the findings in the experiments.

40|$|The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based {{radionavigation}} {{system designed}} for positioning, velocity determination and timing. The relative movement between a GPS receiver and a GPS satellite causes the received signal frequency to {{differ from the}} transmitted frequency due to the Doppler effect. This frequency difference, an observable in GPS measurements, {{is referred to as}} the Doppler shift. However, the Doppler shift is biased by the inherent errors in the signal propagation. Since velocities of GPS satellites are known, the velocity of a user can be determined through observing four or more satellites, similar to GPS positioning. When the GPS selective availability (SA) was activated, errors imposed on the ephemeris and satellite clocks significantly affected the accuracy of both GPS positioning and velocity determination. The removal of SA has enabled a significant improvement on the accuracy of both GPS satellite orbits and clocks. As a result, velocity accuracy at sub-centimetre per second level is achievable for standalone GPS users if all the errors associated with the Doppler observables are corrected for properly. This paper overviews the developments in precise velocity determination and investigates all error sources associated with the Doppler measurement. The properties of errors in the Doppler shift are analysed and the methods to eliminate or mitigate these errors are discussed. The relativistic errors such as the orbit eccentricity and the Sagnac effect are derived and formulated in easy forms for correction. Algorithms for modelling the atmosphere delay rates are also presented. It is concluded that real-time velocities in <b>millimetres</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> level are achievable if the error correction schemes provided are used...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study is conducted {{as a part}} of a Department of Energy funded SunShot project titled “High Temperature Falling Particle Receiver”. In this concept, solid particles are heated by concentrated sunlight to very high temperatures to the point that they can become a suitable heat source for various thermal power and thermochemical cycles. Furthermore, one of the great advantages of this concept is the ability to store thermal energy in the solid particles at relatively low cost. However, an important feature of any Particle Heat Receiver (PHR) system is the particle to fluid heat exchanger (PFHXer), which is the interface between the solar energy system and the thermal power or chemical system. In order to create this system material data is needed for the design and optimization of this PFHXer. This study focuses on the heat transfer properties of particulates to solid surfaces. The particulates will be evaluated for three grain sizes of sand and two grain sizes of proppants. These two materials will be tested at one, five and ten <b>millimetres</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in order to see how the various flow rates, which will be required for different loads, will affect the heat transfer coefficient. Finally the heat transfer coefficient will also be evaluated for both finned and non-finned heat exchangers to see the effect that changes in the surface geometry and surface area have on the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient will help determine the appropriate material that will be used in the PHR system. An experimental procedure is under development by Georgia Institute of Technology to examine the heat transfer coefficient. To accurately characterize the size distribution of the materials, the material will be placed through a sifting unit. Afterwards the material will be placed into the testing apparatus. The main components of the testing apparatus consist of the Old's Elevator which is used to move the sand and the PFHXer. The PFHXer is made up of the constant head plenum and the heating box. The constant head plenum allows for a constant particulate head and uniform flow. The heating unit is made up of eight electric cartridge heaters. These heaters act as the non-finned tubed heaters and through the use of a metal casing can also be changed into finned tubed heaters. By running the system to steady and state and measuring the surface, inlet and outlet temperatures the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated...|$|E
