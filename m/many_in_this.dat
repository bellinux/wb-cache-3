25|$|Symons {{believed}} in old fashioned military tactics of close order, where by concentrating {{troops on the}} attack he hoped to smash the Boer defences. The reality was that these formations were not designed to be used against long range bolt action rifles and Symons' brigades {{would be the first}} of <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war to pay the heavy cost of the mistake, as many generals would repeat it. However, his orders for the cavalry commander, Colonel Möller, were less conventional, telling him to act on his own initiative; it would be another costly mistake.|$|E
25|$|Before the First World War, {{mechanic}} Charles Marius Fouché {{cooperated with}} engineer Édouard Quellennec and the latter's son Jacques Quellennec to adapt existing caterpillar tractors {{to the conditions}} of Egyptian and French farming, among them the Holt Model 75. In this context in 1914 contacts were made with engineer Eugène Brillié of Schneider & Co. to adapt the Castéran Flexible Track Tractor. When that year war broke out, Jacques Quellennec was drafted as an infantry sergeant, witnessed most men of his unit being slaughtered during the First Battle of the Marne and was then severely wounded {{at the end of}} October. While recovering, he devised plans for an armoured tractor armed with a machine-gun and capable of destroying German machine-gun nests. <b>Many</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period had comparable ideas but contrary to most, Quellennec had excellent contacts. Fouché had become a second lieutenant with the Grand Parc Automobile de Réserve of the Service Automobile, the Army branch responsible for motorisation, and Brillié was chief designer with one of France's main arms manufacturers. Early December, Quellennec met Fouché in Paris and both then went to Brillié to present drawings of a tracked armoured fighting vehicle. During a second visit Quellennec urged Brillié to bring over two Holt Model 75 tractors, at that time present in Tunisia, to France in order to perform the first trials. Brillié showed himself less than enthusiastic about the idea, objecting there would be not enough room on a tractor for both crew and armament. In February 1915, Quellennec was sent to an air force training base and tasked Fouché with trying to convince Brillié, without much apparent success.|$|E
