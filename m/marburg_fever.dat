40|$|<b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (<b>Marburg</b> HF) is a rare, severe type of {{hemorrhagic fever}} which affects both humans and {{non-human}} primates. Caused by a genetically unique zoonotic (that is, animal-borne) RNA virus of the filovirus family, its recognition {{led to the}} creation of this virus family. The five subtypes of Ebola virus are the only other known members of the filovirus family. Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967, when outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever occurred simultaneously in laboratories in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). A total of 31 people became ill; they included laboratory workers as well as several medical personnel and family members who had cared for them. There were 7 deaths among the reported cases. The first people infected had been exposed to African green monkeys or their tissues. In Marburg, the monkeys had been imported for research and to prepare polio vaccine. In addition to the 31 cases, an additional primary case was retrospectively serologically diagnosed. What is <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever?</b> [...] Where is Marburg virus found nature?

40|$|Bats {{have long}} been known to host many {{infectious}} agents. This is unsurprising, as to date, viruses from over 60 groups {{have been reported in}} bats. Many of the pathogens are an extreme public health risk as they lead to diseases that result in fatal encephalitides (rabies, Nipah, Hendra viruses) and hemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola viruses). Even more worrisome, recent disease surveillance in various regions (such as Kenya, Uganda, Bangladesh, Peoples Republic of China), have shown species of bats to be hosts of emerging infectious pathogens that have been proven a public health threat to the people they live among (example: the SARs 2003 outbreak in China, <b>Marburg</b> <b>fever</b> outbreaks in Africa, Nipah encephalitis outbreaks in Bangladesh). In this modern world with increased mobility of animals, animal products, and people, evidence of a pathogen at a certain location could potentially pose a larger global threat. These field surveys were under taken during 2006 - 2009 with partial support from the Global Disease Detection Program and O. C. Hubert Fellowship in International Public Health and Epidemiology – from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (4, 2). By collecting a selected sample size of various bat species throughout the southern half of Kenya, we are looking for novel emerging and re-emerging pathogens, trying to better understand their pathobiology, distribution and circulation patterns, and the existing and potential threat for veterinary and public health, {{as well as for the}} bat populations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> is rare yet {{among the}} most severe {{diseases}} affecting humans, with case fatality ratio even higher than 80 %. By analyzing the largest documented <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> epidemic, which occurred in Angola in 2005 and caused 329 deaths, and data on viral load over time in non-human primates, we make an assessment of transmissibility and severity of the disease. We also give insight into the control of new <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> epidemics to inform appropriate health responses. We estimated {{the distribution of the}} generation time to have mean 9 days (95 %CI: 8. 2 - 10 days) and standard deviation 5. 4 days (95 %CI: 3. 9 - 8. 6 days), and the basic reproduction number to be R(0) = 1. 59 (95 %CI: 1. 53 - 1. 66). Model simulations suggest that a timely isolation of cases, starting no later than 2 - 3 days after symptoms onset, is sufficient to contain an outbreak. Our analysis reveals that <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> is characterized by a relatively small reproduction number and by a relatively long generation time. Such factors, along with the extremely high severity and fatality, support the rare occurrence of large epidemics in human populations. Our results also support the effectiveness of social distancing measures [...] case isolation in particular [...] to contain or at least to mitigate an emerging outbreak.

40|$|After an {{imported}} case of <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> {{was reported in}} 2008 in the Netherlands, control measures to prevent transmission were implemented. To evaluate consequences of these measures, we administered a structured questionnaire to 130 contacts classifi ed as either having high-risk or low-risk exposure to body fl uids of the case-patient; 77 (59. 2 %) of 130 contacts responded. A total of 67 (87. 0 %) of 77 respondents agreed that temperature monitoring and reporting was necessary, signifi cantly more often among high-risk than low-risk contacts (p< 0. 001). Strict compliance with daily temperature monitoring decreased from 80. 5 % (62 / 77) during week 1 to 66. 2 % (51 / 77) during week 3.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{outbreak}} of <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> was first {{observed in a}} gold-mining village in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in October 1998. METHODS: We investigated the {{outbreak of}} <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> most intensively in May and October 1999. Sporadic cases and short chains of human-to-human transmission continued to occur until September 2000. Suspected cases were identified {{on the basis of}} a case definition; cases were confirmed by the detection of virus antigen and nucleic acid in blood, cell culture, antibody responses, and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 154 cases (48 laboratory-confirmed and 106 suspected) were identified (case fatality rate, 83 percent); 52 percent of cases were in young male miners. Only 27 percent of these men reported having had contact with other affected persons, whereas 67 percent of patients who were not miners reported such contact (P< 0. 001). Most of the affected miners (94 percent) worked in an underground mine. Cessation of the outbreak coincided with flooding of the mine. Epidemiologic evidence of multiple introductions of infection into the population was substantiated by the detection of at least nine genetically distinct lineages of virus in circulation during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Marburg</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> can have a very high case fatality rate. Since multiple genetic variants of virus were identified, ongoing introduction of virus into the population helped perpetuate this outbreak. The findings imply that reservoir hosts of Marburg virus inhabit caves, mines, or similar habitats. Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society...|$|R
