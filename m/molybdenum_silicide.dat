Electron microscopy was employed to characterize the partially-and fully-reacted regions for the Mo-Si and Nb-Si systems, and revealed only equilibrium phases.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} areas in materials science is modeling of the mechanical behavior of materials. Macroscopic properties, such as plastic flow and brittleness, are determined by processes occurring at the atomic level and are mainly influenced by the properties of extended defects. Understanding the energetics and structural properties of dislocations, grain boundaries and other extended defects enables to gain a valuable insight into the deformation mechanisms and allows to design specific ways to overcome intrinsic limitations of materials. In this thesis, we study the properties of extended defects in four bcc transition metals—Nb, Ta, Mo and W, using the bond order potentials (BOP). These potentials are based on the real-space parameterized tight-binding method and are eminently suitable for modeling of extended defects in materials with predominantly metallic and covalent type of bonding. Our results confirm that the unusual plastic behavior of bcc transition metals is governed by the properties of the a/ 2 [111] screw dislocations and reveal quantitatively the overall invalidity of the well-known Schmid law in these materials. The most recent improvement of BOP has been a derivation of analytic environmental dependence of bond integrals. This development extends the transferability of the BOP model and its applicability to multi-component systems.

A major challenge, however, is to simultaneously achieve high oxidation resistance and acceptable mechanical properties at high temperatures. For example, molybdenum disilicide (MoSi 2) has excellent oxidation resistance and poor mechanical properties, while Mo-rich silicides such as Mo 5 Si 3 (called T 1) have much better mechanical properties but poor oxidation resistance. One approach {{is based on}} the fabrication of MoSi 2 −T 1 composites that combine high oxidation resistance of MoSi 2 and good mechanical properties of T 1. Another approach involves the addition of boron to Mo-rich silicides for improving their oxidation resistance through the formation of a borosilicate surface layer. In particular, Mo 5 SiB 2 (called T 2) phase is considered as an attractive material. In the thesis, MoSi 2 −T 1 composites and materials based on T 2 phase are obtained by mechanically activated SHS. Use of SHS compaction (quasi-isostatic pressing) significantly improves oxidation resistance of the obtained MoSi 2 −T 1 composites. Combustion of Mo−Si−B mixtures for the formation of T 2 phase becomes possible if the composition is designed for the addition of more exothermic reactions leading to the formation of molybdenum boride. These mixtures exhibit spin combustion, the characteristics of which are in good agreement with the spin combustion theory. Oxidation resistance of the obtained Mo−Si−B materials is independent on the concentration of Mo phase in the products so that the materials with a higher Mo content are preferable because of better mechanical properties.

Therefore, the present study deals with the synthesis and characterization of all the constituents' major and minor products formed during synthesisof catalyst both unreduced and reduced by X-ray diffraction studies. The results indicated the formation of appreciable amount of nickel hydro silicates and small amount of ionic nickel carbonate and nickel carbonate hydrate in the unreduced catalyst. Besides the formation of major product, hetropolyacid and nickel <b>molybdenum</b> <b>silicide</b> were also present in the unreduced catalyst. The catalyst was reduced at 600 °C before carrying the hydrogenolysis reactions and the reduced products were also analyzed for the composition, when the catalyst activity was the maximum. The various chemical reactions involved in the synthesis procedure have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Interatomic bonding in the {{refractory}} {{transition metal}} iridium and transition metal-based intermetallic compound MoSi 2 is of mixed metallic and covalent character. Such interatomic bonding {{is associated with}} the strong angular dependencies of covalent bonds and these affect significantly the structures and properties of the extended defects, such as dislocations and grain boundaries, that control plastic deformation and fracture in these materials. Bond-order potentials (BOPs) have been developed for iridium and the <b>molybdenum</b> <b>silicides</b> that capture accurately the angular character of bonding. A many-body repulsive term in the expression for the total energy allowed the negative Cauchy pressures of both iridium and MoSi 2 to be fitted. The environmental dependencies of bond integrals in the open C 11 b crystal structure of MoSi 2 were introduced explicitly via analytic screening functions derived using non-orthogonal tight-binding theory. The BOPs were constructed by fitting to a small set of experimental and ab initio calculated data. Rigorous testing of the BOPS showed that they are very accurate and transferable to environments substantially different from those used in their construction. Hence, they are eminently suitable for the atomistic simulation of extended defects. Atomistic simulation of the screw dislocation in iridium found a metastable, non-planar configuration for the core in addition to a glissile planar core that corresponds to dissociation into Shockley partials. Stress applications showed that transformations between these two core structures are driven primarily by applied stress and give rise to a mechanism for cross-slip that does not require thermal activation. Such athermal cross-slip then leads to an unusually high rate of dislocation multiplication and extensive plasticity owing to the unusually high frequency of the formation of Frank-Read sources. It is proposed that this process accounts for the high dislocation densities accumulated homogeneously in plastically deformed iridium and the associated strong work hardening found experimentally. This strong work hardening is linked intimately with the tendency of iridium to undergo brittle transgranular cleavage since the mean free path of dislocations can become so small that the material cannot relax stress concentrations around cracks by dislocation mediated plasticity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{environmental}} resistance {{is a critical}} material barrier to the operation of fossil systems with the improved energy efficiencies and emissions performance described by {{the goals of the}} Vision 21 concept of the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy. All fossil fuel-derived processes contain reactive species and high-temperature degradation arising from reactions of solids with gases and condensible products often limits performance or materials lifetimes such that efficiency, emission, and/or economic targets or requirements are not realized. Therefore, historically, the development of materials for fossil-fuel combustion and conversion systems has been closely linked to corrosion studies of alloys and ceramics in appropriate environments. This project is somewhat different from such studies in that it focuses on the feasibility of new routes to controlling the critical chemical and mechanical phenomena that collectively form the basis for environmental protection in relevant fossil environments by exploring compositional and microstructural manipulations and cooperative phenomena that have not necessarily been examined in any detail to date. This can hopefully lead to concepts for ''smart'' coatings or materials that have the ability to sense and respond appropriately to a particular set or series of environmental conditions in order to provide high-temperature corrosion protection. The strategies being explored involve cooperative or in-place oxidation or sulfidation reactions of multiphase alloys. [1, 2] The first material systems to be evaluated involve silicides as {{there is some evidence that}} such materials have enhanced resistance in oxidizing-sulfidizing and sulfidizing environments and in air/oxygen at very high temperatures. [3] In this regard, <b>molybdenum</b> <b>silicides</b> may prove to be of particular interest. Molybdenum is known to sulfidize fairly slowly[4] and there has been recent progress in developing Mo-Si-B systems with improved oxidation resistance at high and intermediate temperatures. [5 - 11] Consequently, Mo-Si-B alloys with different compositions and phase morphologies were oxidized in dry air at 1200 C under cyclic oxidation conditions. In addition, elevated-temperature oxidation-sulfidation exposures of Mo-Mo 5 SiB 2 -Mo 3 Si alloys also were conducted. In this way, the specific effects of the multiphase nature (composition, morphology) of the Mo-Si-B system on protective product formation are being evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Nickel-base {{superalloys}} exhibit excellent creep strength, oxidation resistance, and fracture toughness. This spectacular {{combination of}} properties {{did not come}} without effort – it required many decades of basic and applied research. However, nickel-base superalloys are approaching one fundamental limitation – their melting point. Since advanced superalloys melt at temperatures {{on the order of}} 1350 °C, significant strengthening can be obtained only at temperatures below 1150 °C. Presently, attention is focused on three materials systems capable of substantially higher service temperatures: niobium <b>silicides,</b> <b>molybdenum</b> borosilicides, and iridium-base superalloys. Each of these systems has its advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this review is to provide an objective assessment of these three systems, to point out critical issues, and to suggest topics for further research...|$|R
