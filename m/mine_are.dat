25|$|The Williamson diamond mine {{is a large}} {{open pit}} mine {{currently}} about 90 meters (300ft) deep. Diamond mining operations at the Williamson diamond <b>mine</b> <b>are</b> composed of four distinct activities: mining of the pit, re-treatment of tailings to recover missed diamonds, and gravel mining both on the property and adjacent to the property where gravel has been alluvially deposited. The open pit mining and tailings re-treatment are {{the largest of the}} four operations. The mine employs about 1,100 staff, mostly Tanzanians.|$|E

The mines can be dispensed on right, left and backwards of the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Initial proven {{reserves}} of the Argyle mine were 61 million tonnes of ore, {{with an average}} ore grade of 6.8 carats (1.36 g) per ore tonne, about 400 million carats (80,000kg). Further estimated reserves of 14 million tonnes of ore, at a grade of 6.1 carats (1.22 g) per tonne (85 million carats, 17,000kg), also existed. As of 2001, reserves and resources in the open-pit mined area contain 220 million tonnes of 2.5 to 3.0 carat (500 to 600mg) per tonne graded ore, sufficient to sustain current production rates until 2007.

The Upper Coal Measures above the Worsley Four Foot mine horizon were worked at Bradford, where the Worsley Four Foot is known as the Parker mine. The Two Foot, Doctor, New, Yard, Bradford Four Foot, Three Quarters and Charlotte mines, above the Parker <b>mine,</b> <b>are</b> known as the Bradford Group; the Charlotte mine is closest to the surface. The Openshaw mine, above the Charlotte, was worked for fireclay. Below the Bradford Group and the Parker <b>mine</b> <b>are</b> the Top, Middle and Deep mines, and [...] below them, the Roger mine. The Top, Middle and Deep mines correspond to the Major, Bland, and Ashton Great mines in the Oldham Coalfield.

[...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and <b>mine</b> <b>are</b> too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics.
