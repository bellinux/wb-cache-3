There are in fact many different forms of the {{equation of}} state. Since the ideal gas law neglects both molecular size and inter <b>molecular</b> <b>attractions,</b> it is most accurate for monatomic gases at high temperatures and low pressures. The neglect of molecular size becomes less important for lower densities, i.e. for larger volumes at lower pressures, because the average distance between adjacent molecules becomes {{much larger than the}} molecular size. The relative importance of intermolecular attractions diminishes with increasing thermal kinetic energy, i.e., with increasing temperatures. More detailed equations of state, such as the van der Waals equation, account for deviations from ideality caused by molecular size and intermolecular forces.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mechanics}} of shear failure of rock under pressure has been made. The transition from brittle to ductile failure occurs when the friction along the fracture surfaces exceeds the shear strength of the rock. A machine has been developed for measuring both the shear strength of rock and the friction along rock fracture surfaces. In this shear machine, the fractures are forced along definite planes; as a result, the rock is stronger than in compression tests where the fractures choose the weakest paths through the specimens. Friction is composed of several forces: (1) the forces to slide irregularities on surfaces over each other; (2) forces to shear some of these irregulari-ties; (3) <b>molecular</b> <b>attractions</b> across the fractures; and (4) forces required to break bonds resulting from melting and welding at the tips of irregularities on the surfaces. Friction along rock fracture surfaces is not proportional to contact pressure as usually assumed; instead, it increases as the contact pressure raised to the 0. 4 to 0. 8 power.

The ordinary reader may refer to a discussion of his scientific work in chapter VI of Osborne's biography of Sutherland, but the full value of it could only be computed by a physicist willing to collate his papers with the state of knowledge at the time each was written. It was well known and valued in England, Germany and America. Professor T. R. Lyle said at the time of Sutherland's death that he was [...] "the greatest authority living in molecular physics".

50|$|Porosity gives {{a measure}} of the water storage {{capability}} of soil but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by gravity. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like surface tension and <b>molecular</b> <b>attraction.</b> Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as specific yield. The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as specific retention. Thus {{it can be said that}} porosity is the sum of specific yield and specific retention. Specific yield of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong <b>molecular</b> <b>attraction</b> with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high specific yield than cohesive soils because the former has significantly less <b>molecular</b> <b>attraction</b> then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse sandstone can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%.

The concentration of minerals, mainly calcium and phosphate, and proteins in centrifuged supernatants was significantly lowered with increase in either pH or temperature. Lactic acid content decreased with pH decline and rose at higher temperatures. Calcium appeared to form complexes with phosphates and lactates mainly, which in turn may have induced <b>molecular</b> <b>attractions</b> with the proteins. An increase in pH led to more soluble protein aggregates with large particle sizes. Surface hydrophobicity of these particles increased significantly with temperature up to 40 °C and decreased with further heating to 90 °C. Surface charge was clearly pH dependent. High lactic acid concentrations appeared to hinder protein aggregation by hydrophobic interactions and may also indirectly influence protein denaturation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of two non-ionic surfactant additives (Triton X- 100 and Brij 35) on {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) biodegradation was evaluated using the chemical molecular interaction method, {{which is based on}} the theory Of cohesive energy density (CED). The results indicated that PAHs have relatively higher CED values because aromatic compounds with labile pi are more polarized and this encourages <b>molecular</b> <b>attractions</b> involving induced dipole force. Under different PAH-surfactant compositions, similar CED values, which facilitated their intermolecular attractions through pi-pi electron interactions, gave rise to a similar biodegradation pattern. For example, when induced enzymes were able to target the same molecular bonding on the PAH and Triton X- 100, rapid degradation rates were observed in both systems. The distribution of the PAH in the monomer or micelle surfactant bulk affected the rate of PAH biodegradation. Quantification of the bacterial activity by applying specific oxygen uptake requirements (SOUR) identified an effect involving chemical molecular interaction. Changes in the physiological characteristics as measured by BioLog GN microplate measurements were identifiable and also could be related to the chemical structure of the dual substrates. Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) changed when PAH biodegradation took place {{in the presence of the}} different surfactants.

Many organisms including mammalians use Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) {{which are also}} called Host Defense Peptides against microbial organisms. AMPs are among one of the ancient and successful strategies for both plant and animal kingdoms. Even though AMPs vary among closely related species and despite they have different sequences, many of the natural AMPs share similar properties. They are mostly short sequenced, structurally amphipathic and they carry overall net positive charge. Cationic AMPs target bacterial membranes because of the electrostatic attractions between positively charged peptides and negatively charged membranes. Due to the electrostatic attractions, cationic AMPs might work on membrane disruption by passing a certain threshold concentration for hydrophobic groups to penetrate into membrane.

40|$|Compressible flow {{varies from}} ideal-gas {{behavior}} at high pressures where molecular interactions become important. Density is described through a cubic {{equation of state}} while enthalpy and sound speed are functions of both temperature and pressure, based on two parameters, A and B, related to intermolecular attraction and repulsion, respectively. Assuming small variations from ideal-gas behavior, a closed-form solution is obtained that is valid {{over a wide range}} of conditions. An expansion in these molecular-interaction parameters simplifies relations for flow variables, elucidating the role of <b>molecular</b> repulsion and <b>attraction</b> in variations from ideal-gas behavior. Real-gas modifications in density, enthalpy, and sound speed for a given pressure and temperature lead to variations in many basic compressible flow configurations. Sometimes, the variations can be substantial in quantitative or qualitative terms. The new approach is applied to choked-nozzle flow, isentropic flow, nonlinear-wave propagation, and flow across a shock wave, all for the real gas. Modifications are obtained for allowable mass-flow through a choked nozzle, nozzle thrust, sonic wave speed, Riemann invariants, Prandtl's shock relation, and the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Forced acoustic oscillations can show substantial augmentation of pressure amplitudes when real-gas effects are taken into account. Shocks at higher temperatures and pressures can have larger pressure jumps with real-gas effects. Weak shocks decay to zero strength at sonic speed. The proposed framework can rely on any cubic equation of state and be applied to multicomponent flows or to more-complex flow configurations. Comment: 63 pages, 12 Figure...|$|R

We report such measurements for two molecularly smooth surfaces of mica separated by the nematic liquid crystal 4 '-n-pentyl 4 -cyanobiphenyl (5 CB) in both the planar and homeotropic orientations at room temperature. The force is determined by measuring the deflection of a spring supporting one of the mica pieces, while an optical technique is used to measure the film thickness to an accuracy of ± (0. 1 - 0. 2) nm. The technique also allows the refractive indices of the nematic to be measured, and hence a determination of the average density and order parameter of the liquid crystal film {{as a function of}} its thickness. Three distinct forces were measured, each reflecting a type of ordering of the liquid crystal near the mica surfaces. The first one results from elastic déformation in the liquid crystal; it was only observed in a twisted planar sample where the 5 CB molecules are oriented in different directions at the two mica surfaces. The second, measured in both the planar and homeotropic orientations, is attributed to an enhanced order parameter near the surfaces. Both of these are monotonic repulsive forces measurable below 80 nm. Finally, there is a short-range force which oscillates as a function of thickness, up to about six <b>molecular</b> layers, between <b>attraction</b> and repulsion.

Serial observations of these cells before and after 4 and 12 hr incubation were carried out by means of interference, Soret absorption, polarization microscopy, and the electron microscope employing the freeze-etching technique. Light microscopic studies showed a progressive contraction of cellular contents into central masses which, after 12 hr dehydration, formed birefringent intracellular hemoglobin crystals in 50 – 75 % of the cells. Electron microscopic study of freeze-etched replicas of these cells at 0, 4, and 12 hr of dehydration reveals progressive aggregation, alignment, and crystallization of hemoglobin molecules. Molecular aggregation found in C-C cells prior to osmotic dehydration was not seen in normal erythrocytes. Aggregation and packing varied from cell to cell. Reticulocytes showed a loosely packed aggregate mesh-work; older cells showed variation of molecular packing, which appeared tightest in cells corresponding to microspherocytes. With further loss of intracellular water, aggregates coalesced into patterns of tighter molecular packing with small regions of alignment, and, finally, crystallization occurred. Hemoglobin molecules measuring 70 A in diameter were readily identified within the period patterns of intracellular crystals. These {{findings suggest that the}} hemoglobin C molecules within C-C erythrocytes exist in an aggregated state. As the cell ages, intracellular water is lost and intermolecular distance decreases, hemoglobin C molecules polymerize into intracellular crystals.

50|$|In his 1873 thesis, van der Waals {{noted the}} non-ideality of real gases and {{attributed}} {{it to the}} existence of intermolecular interactions. He introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. Spearheaded by Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time van der Waals' thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction. The effect of Van der Waals's work on molecular physics in the 20th century was direct and fundamental. By introducing parameters characterizing <b>molecular</b> size and <b>attraction</b> in constructing his equation of state, Van der Waals set the tone for modern molecular science. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and multipolar interactions should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids is presently considered an axiom. With the help of the van der Waals's equation of state, the critical-point parameters of gases could be accurately predicted from thermodynamic measurements made at much higher temperatures. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and helium subsequently succumbed to liquefaction. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was significantly influenced by the pioneer work of van der Waals. In 1908, Onnes became the winner of the race to make liquid helium and because of this, he was also to be the discoverer of superconductivity in 1911.|$|R

This work reports the first attempt to capture and retain iodine (I 2) using polymer-MOF (ZIF- 8) nanocomposites. Membranes of ZIF- 8 -based nanocomposites (comprising either a glassy Matrimid or a rubbery polyurethane (PU) matrix) were preparedviaa colloidal-mixing approach and their viability for I 2 capture and retention effects was determined through absorption experiments, nanoindentation mechanical measurements, and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. The absorption experiments demonstrated that I 2 capture and retention is possible {{in all of the}} nanocomposite membranes, although the PU/ZIF- 8 30 wt% nanocomposite exhibited higher affinity for I 2 absorption (> 32 wt%). It is reasoned that the <b>molecular</b> affinity and <b>attraction</b> between I 2, (2 -methylimidazolate organic ligands of) ZIF- 8 nanoparticles, and polymer matrices (Matrimid and PU) will catalyse the formation of weak secondary bonds, resulting in the‘capture’ and‘retention’ of I 2 within molecular segments of the polymers and inside the pores of ZIF- 8. The enhancement of the Young's modulus (E) of the PU/ZIF- 8 30 wt% nanocomposite (Eincreased by ∼ 6 %) is postulated to be due to I 2 rigidification, while TGA analysis proved that I 2 retention within both free volume of the polymer and ZIF- 8 sodalite cages remained intact up till the points of structural degradation, at ∼ 200 °C for the PU-based nanocomposites, and at∼ 300 °C for the Matrimid-based nanocomposites. We propose that the affinity of the organic ligands in ZIF- 8 and the formation of free volume in the nanocomposites from the presence of ZIF- 8 attracted I 2, and the formation of secondary bonds between these constituents (H-bonds) strengthened not only the nanocomposite, but also kept I 2 from being released despite the larger pore size and gate-opening dynamics of ZIF- 8. It was therefore concluded that a combination of nanoparticles of porous MOFs and a rubbery polymer is promising for further development to enable I 2 capture and retention applications...|$|R
