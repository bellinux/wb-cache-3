50|$|Hubley's {{casting process}} {{involved}} several steps. For a particular toy, bookend, or doorstop, metalworkers would first carve a wood form, or hammer out the basic design in <b>metal.</b> <b>Pressing</b> this form into finely compacted sand created an impression for molding. Cast iron heated to 3000 degrees was {{poured into the}} sand mold and, when cooled, the form would pop out. Rough edges would be filed away and the mold ready for mass production casting. Painters applied a base coat (usually white or cream but sometimes black) to cast figures whether toys or doorstops.

40|$|Abstract. The study {{deals with}} a {{material}} survey and determination of the corrosion character of a Roman bronze vessel from an early Tiberian period. The ancient technology of the bronze vessel production was determined by evaluation of structural properties of the material using prepared metallographic sections. The vessel was produced by combining the technologies of hammering and <b>metal</b> <b>pressing</b> on a pre-cast bronze piece, side ornaments were cast from bronze. Chlorides were identified along the material grains. It was identified that the mixture of corrosion products covering {{the surface of the}} vessel contained, in addition to other elements, basic copper chloride. The presence of chloride anions, atmospheric humidity and mechanical stress lead to corrosion of the bronze vessel called the “bronze disease”. The material in {{the upper part of the}} vessels lost cohesion completely and the neck of the vessel broke as a result of the corrosion process. The vessel was desalinated and reconstructed in a relatively unique way. At present, the vessel is a property of the National Museum in Prague...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} discharge in China {{is increasing}} with the country' s {{economic development and}} it is worthy of concern. The discharge is primarily relevant to the direct discharge coefficient of each sector of the economy, its direct input coefficient and the final demand in input-output models. In this study, we calculated {{the sensitivity of the}} reduction in the Chinese industrial wastewater discharge using the direct input coefficients based on the theory of error-transmission in an input-output framework. Using input-output models, we calculated the direct and total industrial wastewater discharge coefficients. Analysis of 2007 input-output data of 30 sectors of the Chinese economy and of 30 provincial regions of China indicates that by lowering their direct input coefficients, the manufacturers of textiles, paper and paper products, chemical products, smelting and <b>metal</b> <b>pressing,</b> telecommunication equipment, computers and other electronic equipment will significantly reduce their amounts of industrial wastewater discharge. By lowering intra-provincial direct input coefficients to industrial sectors themselves of Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang, there will be a significant reduction in industrial wastewater discharge for the country as a whole. Investment in production technology and improvement in organizational efficiency in these sectors and in these provinces can help lessen the direct input coefficients, thereby effectively achieving a reduction in industrial wastewater discharge in China via industrial restructuring...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{daylighting}} can substantially {{reduce the}} energy use and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} of commercial buildings. Daylight is also healthy for building occupants, and contributes to occupant satisfaction. When productivity improvements are considered, effective daylighting is also highly attractive financially. However, successful daylighting of sub-tropical buildings {{is a very difficult}} task, due to high direct irradiances and excessive solar shading. A device was created that combined effective solar shading and efficient daylight redirection. The micro-light guiding shade panel achieves all objectives of an optimal daylighting device placed on the façade of a sub-tropical, high rise office building. Its design is based on the principles of non-imaging optics. This provides highly efficient designs offering control over delivered illumination, within the constraints of the second law of thermodynamics. Micro-light guiding shade panels were constructed and installed on a test building. The tested devices delivered daylight deep into the building under all conditions. Some glare was experienced with a poorly chosen translucent material. Glare was eliminated by replacing this material. Construction of the panels could be improved by application of mass-manufacturing techniques including <b>metal</b> <b>pressing.</b> For the micro-light guiding shade panel to be utilised to its full potential, building designers must understand its impact on building performance early in the design process. Thus, the device must be modelled with lighting simulation software currently in use by building design firms. The device was successfully modelled by the RADIANCE lighting simulator. RADIANCE predictions compared well with measurements, providing bias generally less than 10...|$|E

50|$|Independent coachbuilders {{survived for}} a time after the mid-20th century, making bodies for the chassis {{produced}} by low-production companies such as Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Bentley. Producing body dies is extremely expensive (a single door die can run to US$40,000), which is usually only considered practical when large numbers are involved—though that was the path taken by Rolls-Royce and Bentley after 1945 for their own in-house production. Because dies for <b>pressing</b> <b>metal</b> panels are so costly, from the mid 20th century, many vehicles, most notably the Chevrolet Corvette, were clothed with large panels of glass-fibre reinforced resin, which only require inexpensive moulds.

5000|$|Further {{aerodynamic}} refinements {{were carried}} out in Exeter {{with the development of}} new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, [...] "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a [...] "proper" [...] electric car. He said later that he thought [...] "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." [...] Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, [...] "asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications ...". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him.
