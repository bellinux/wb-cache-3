5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend <b>mealybugs</b> to harvest their honeydew. <b>Mealybugs</b> may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect <b>mealybugs</b> from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|Aphids, <b>mealybugs</b> {{and other}} {{invertebrate}} pests can spread viruses. Symptoms {{vary with the}} species, but a loss of vigour is usual.

5000|$|It is {{important}} for vintners {{to distinguish between the}} obscure <b>mealybug</b> and its close relatives, the grape and vine <b>mealybug.</b> The obscure <b>mealybug</b> has longer, thinner, and more crooked filaments than does the vine <b>mealybug,</b> making the obscure <b>mealybug</b> look comparatively untidy. The most distinctive feature of the obscure <b>mealybug</b> is the set of two to four exceptionally long caudal filaments growing from the posterior of large nymphs and adult females.

5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (<b>Mealybugs),</b> large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{sometimes}} {{cause problems}} when they raid fruit crops, but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests {{such as the}} woodboring beetles that create galleries behind the bark and can kill trees. They also eat ants, which may be tending sap-sucking pests such as <b>mealybugs,</b> {{as is the case}} with the rufous woodpecker in coffee plantations in India. Woodpeckers can serve as indicator species, demonstrating the quality of the habitat. Their hole-making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of the ecosystem, because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes, as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and <b>mealybugs.</b> If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E

50|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to control obscure <b>mealybug</b> populations in commercial greenhouses and vineyards, using both synthetic pesticides and introduced <b>mealybug</b> parasites. Since the obscure <b>mealybug's</b> waxy coating and habit of seeking sheltered feeding sites protect it from water-based pesticides, oil-based organophosphate pesticides (among the more toxic of pesticides) are most effective in reducing population density, though such pesticides can harm plants if applied after the first budding.

40|$|Detection of crop {{stress is}} one of the major {{applications}} of remote sensing in agriculture. Many researchers have confirmed the ability of remote sensing techniques for detection of pest/disease on cotton. Hence, this research was designed to investigate, (1) to study the spectral properties of noninfested and <b>mealybug</b> infested cotton crop (ii) damage assessment using remote sensing derived index. Mealybug-infested cotton crop showed significantly lower reflectance in the near infrared region and higher in the visible region of the spectrum compared with the non-infested cotton crop. <b>Mealybug</b> Pest Stress Index- 8 (MPSI- 8), a remote sensing index derived in this study shows a significant negative relationship with <b>mealybug</b> severity (r 2 = 0. 6319) and shows the potential to assess the pest and disease damage because of its characteristic that include pigment, leaf structure, and water sensitive band. MPSI- 8 depicts the change in pigment concentration and water stress and shows a negative relationship with <b>mealybug</b> severity.

40|$|The {{parasitoid}} Gyranusoidea tebygi Noyes {{was released}} in West Africa against the mango <b>mealybug,</b> Rastrococcus invadens Williams, a pest that invaded Africa in the early 1980 s. The ability of G. tebygi to control the mango <b>mealybug</b> was assessed in mango trees using paired sleeve cages. In sleeve cages left open to allow parasitoid attack, G. tebygi reduced <b>mealybug</b> levels 2. 7 -fold within 1. 5 host generations, compared to the closed-sleeve treatment. A parasitism index of 34. 4 % was measured in the open-sleeve treatment. On leaves without sleeves, the parasitism index was a-fold higher, and the <b>mealybug</b> population level was two times lower than that in the open-sleeve treatment. The lower level of the <b>mealybug</b> population on uncaged leaves, compared to the one on leaves protected by open cages, is attributed to higher mortality caused both by parasitism and by abiotic factors such as rain and wind.

500|$|A {{range of}} pests attack cacti in cultivation. Those that feed on sap include: <b>mealybugs,</b> living on both stems and roots; scale insects, {{generally}} only found on stems; whiteflies, which {{are said to}} be an [...] "infrequent" [...] pest of cacti; red spider mites, which are very small but can occur in large numbers, constructing a fine web around themselves and badly marking the cactus via their sap sucking, even if they do not kill it; and thrips, which particularly attack flowers. Some of these pests are resistant to many insecticides, although there are biological controls available. Roots of cacti can be eaten by the larvae of sciarid flies and fungus gnats. Slugs and snails also eat cacti.|$|E
500|$|Such {{disasters}} {{occurred when}} human intervention caused ecological changes by {{the introduction of}} crops to new vectors and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by <b>mealybugs</b> from indigenous trees. New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the rice yellow mottle virus was only found in the Kisumu district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa. Human activity [...] introduced plant viruses to native crops. The citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid Toxoptera citricidus was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in São Paulo, Brazil. CTV and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases. Because of the problems caused by the introduction– by humans– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The vine <b>mealybug,</b> Planococcus ficus (Signoret) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) is a pest with {{significant}} economic {{impact on the}} grape growing industry in South Africa {{and other parts of}} the world. With the isolation and synthesizing of the vine <b>mealybug</b> sex pheromone in 2001, new control options for the integrated management of the vine <b>mealybug</b> have been created. The status of sex pheromone monitoring as a tool in the integrated management of the vine <b>mealybug</b> has been evaluated from different perspectives. A significant quantitative difference in male vine <b>mealybug</b> trap catch numbers has been observed between wine and table grape vineyards and results indicated that there were differences in the susceptibility of grape cultivars to vine <b>mealybug.</b> Currently, the delta trap design is the accepted trap design for vine <b>mealybug</b> monitoring. No studies have yet been conducted to determine the optimum trap parameters like size or design. Population pressure may have an influence on the qualitative efficiency of various trap designs. The basis for degree-day forecasting models has been established adequately. However, refinements need to be done and the incorporation of factors such as humidity and regionality also need to be considered. Daily maximum temperatures fluctuating around the upper developmental threshold temperature for prolonged periods of time seemed to suppress population numbers. Different vineyard management practices exist for wine and table grape production. While an action threshold of 65 vine <b>mealybug</b> males per trap per two-week period seems an acceptable threshold for table grape production, it may not be appropriate for wine grape (or raisin grape) production. Using sex pheromone traps for population monitoring is a valid technique in the arsenal of management tactics against the vine <b>mealybug.</b> However, refinements and validation of research results must be done further to build credibility into the monitoring system.

2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} {{have formed a}} relationship with an invasive mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis. Colony growth is known to increase if ants have access to resources produced by P. solenopsis, and the population density of these <b>mealybugs</b> is significantly higher in areas where red imported fire ants are present (the spread of P. solenopsis in areas it is not native is attributed {{to the presence of}} the ants). As well as that, the life expectancy and reproductive rate of P. solenopsis both increase. These <b>mealybugs</b> may even be transported by workers back to their nest. Predation of P. solenopsis decreases due to tending workers interfering with the predation and parasitism by natural enemies. <b>Mealybugs</b> are preyed on by the lady beetle (Menochilus sexmaculatus) and are hosts of two parasites (Aenasius bambawalei and Acerophagus coccois) if there are no ants present, but this is different if ants are present. Lady beetles are less frequently seen on plants with red imported fire ants, and the rate of [...] "mummy" [...] nymphs is significantly lower. This is clearly evident as scientists observed that cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) populations, and the predation of sentinel bollworm eggs, increased in areas with red imported fire ant presence. Red imported fire ants have developed a mutual relationship with another mealybug (Dysmicoccus morrisoni). The ants promote the colony growth of D. morrisoni through protection, covering the colonies up with debris and collecting the honeydew they secrete.|$|E
