5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, 1,800 {{travellers}} attempted {{this route}} {{but the vast}} <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> caught along the river when the region iced over in October. Only 43 successfully reached the Klondike before winter and of those 35 had to return, having thrown away their equipment en route to reach their destination in time. The remainder mostly found themselves stranded in isolated camps and settlements along the ice-covered river often in desperate circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices in the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an}} extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E

5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E
5|$|In total, the war caused 500,000 {{refugees}} and displaced persons. Around 196,000 to 247,000 (in 1993) Croats and other non-Serbs were displaced {{during the war}} from or around the RSK. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said that 221,000 were displaced in 2006, of which 218,000 had returned. The <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> displaced during the initial fighting and during the JNA offensives of 1991 and 1992. Some 150,000 Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbia have obtained Croatian citizenship since 1991, many due to incidents like the expulsions in Hrtkovci.|$|E

5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1915, Royal Edward {{embarked}} 1,367 {{officers and}} men at Avonmouth. The <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry Division, {{with members of}} the Royal Army Medical Corps. All were destined for Gallipoli. Royal Edward was reported off the Lizard on the evening of the 28th, and had arrived at Alexandria on 10 August, a day after sister ship Royal George had sailed from Devonport. Royal Edward sailed for Moudros on the island of Lemnos, a staging point for the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments1 and 64, the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> not found in their original locations.|$|E

5|$|Polish science {{reached its}} {{culmination}} {{in the first}} half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E
5|$|The few Turks {{who survived}} the {{massacre}} fled into the mountains, where the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> killed by the local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their troops, with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
50|$|The Real <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> often {{compared}} and {{contrasted with}} The Emerging Republican Majority, {{a book by}} Republican strategist Kevin Phillips which was released at the same time.

5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest Theorem has {{numerous}} {{applications in}} hardness of approximation and social choice theory. We give a new {{proof of the}} <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest Theorem by induction on the dimension of the discrete cube. Unlike the previous proof, it uses neither the "invariance principle" nor Borell's result in Gaussian space. The new proof is general enough to include all previous variants of <b>majority</b> <b>is</b> stablest such as "it ain't over until it's over" and "Majority is most predictable". Moreover, the new proof allows us to derive a proof of <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest in a constant level of the Sum of Squares hierarchy.
