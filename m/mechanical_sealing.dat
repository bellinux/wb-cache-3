40|$|Background: Anastomotic leakage {{remains a}} major {{complication}} following colorectal surgery, with a largely unknown pathophysiology and limited treatment options. Previous clinical studies {{have revealed that}} many leakages on colo-rectal anastomoses remain subclinical. Prior attempts at prophylactic <b>mechanical</b> <b>sealing</b> of gastrointestinal anastomoses, i. e., the application of various forms of mesh and fibrin components, have been disappointing. We therefore decided {{to determine whether a}} collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components (TachoSil and reg;) is able to seal leaking colonic anastomoses and thereby prevent clinical leakage and peritonitis. Material and methods: Prospective study on 20 pigs operated with experimentally induced defects in colonic anastomoses randomized to sealing vs. no sealing with a collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components. The primary study endpoints were visible leakage at the anastomotic site, death or illness causing sacrifice and fecal peritonitis (local or diffuse). Results: A significant reduction in macroscopic anastomotic leakage in the group of pigs with sealed anastomoses was found (2 / 10 vs. 9 / 10, p= 0. 0055). Furthermore, macroscopic examination of the abdominal cavity (n= 20) showed a significant decrease in peritonitis in the sealed vs. non-sealed groups (2 vs. 9, p= 0. 0055). Additionally, a reduction, although non-significant, in dead and sacrificed animals {{before the end of the}} observation period (1 vs. 4) was found in the sealed group.

The LPP system has the following design features that overcome these problems: 1) shallow placement, 2) narrow trenches, 3) continuous trenching, 4) pressure-dosed with uniform distribution of the effluent, 5) design based on areal loading, and 6) resting and reaeration between doses. The main components of an LPP system are: • a septic tank or an aerobic unit; • pumping (dosing) chamber (submersible effluent pump, level controls, high water alarm, and supply manifold); and • small diameter distribution laterals with small perforations (holes). The septic tank is where settleable and floatable solids are removed and primary treatment occurs. Partially clarified effluent then flows by gravity to a pumping chamber where it is stored until it reaches the level of A General Overview the upper float control, which turns the pump on. The level controls are set for a specific pumping sequence of one to two times daily, allowing breaks in between doses for the soil to absorb the wastewater.
