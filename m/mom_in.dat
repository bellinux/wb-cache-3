500|$|Critics have judged Mom & Me & Mom and Angelou's other autobiographies [...] "in {{light of}} the first", and Caged Bird {{generally}} receives the highest praise. [...] Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, considers the book a sequel to Caged Bird.' [...] Many of the events described in Angelou's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one, some with more detail than others, such as her period of homelessness, which was described in Caged Bird, and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend, which was first disclosed in Letter to My Daughter (2008), Angelou's third book of essays. [...] According to Fiona Sturges, who reviewed Mom & Me & <b>Mom</b> <b>in</b> the British publication The Independent, [...] "As in her previous books, these tales are told with clear-sightedness and an absence of self-pity, and they are no less grim for their familiarity. Angelou has never been one for florid prose, and here she maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid, like a film from which you can't look away". [...] Sayers states that major dramatic events, such as the incident when Angelou was beaten, [...] "are delivered without much amplification or further reference".|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the <b>mom</b> <b>in</b> the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
500|$|Starting with Caged Bird, Angelou made a {{deliberate}} attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including Mom & Me & Mom, {{to challenge the}} usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction. [...] Valerie Sayers, in her review of Mom & Me & <b>Mom</b> <b>in</b> The Washington Post, calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing {{what it was like}} to grow up Black in [...] "Jim Crow America". [...] Sayers states: [...] "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking at it, a neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill". [...] Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only [...] "serious" [...] writer to choose the genre to express herself. [...] As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. [...] Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to convince her to write Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art", which she continued throughout her series. [...] Although Angelou was successful, she was, as Sayers insisted, smart and gifted enough to write for any audience, but chose not to write for [...] "a highbrow literary audience", but for [...] "readers as open, playful and straightforward as herself".|$|E
