5|$|The {{congregation}} {{carried out}} extensive charity campaigns during the Passover season; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon-loads of <b>matzos</b> to poor Jews {{so they could}} celebrate the holiday. By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|E
25|$|Some machine-made <b>matzos</b> are {{completed}} within 5 minutes of being kneaded.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>matzos</b> {{come out}} of the oven, the entire work area is {{scrubbed}} down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now chametz, and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.|$|E
25|$|Popular Ashkenazi {{dishes are}} <b>matzo</b> brei (crumbled <b>matzo</b> with grated onion, fried with {{scrambled}} egg), <b>matzo</b> latkes (pancakes) and chremslach (also called crimsel or gresjelies; <b>matzo</b> meal fritters). Wined <b>matzo</b> kugels (pudding) {{have been introduced}} into modern Jewish cooking. For thickening soups and sauces at Passover fine <b>matzo</b> meal or potato flour is used instead of flour: for frying fish or cutlets, a coating of <b>matzo</b> meal and egg, and for stuffing, potatoes instead of soaked bread.|$|R
50|$|After baking, <b>matzo</b> may {{be ground}} into fine crumbs, known as <b>matzo</b> meal. <b>Matzo</b> meal {{can be used}} like flour {{during the week of}} Passover when flour can {{otherwise}} be used only to make <b>matzo.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Matzo</b> {{balls and}} <b>matzo</b> farfel are served in soup. <b>Matzo</b> brei is {{a dish of}} Ashkenazi origin made from <b>matzo</b> soaked in water and fried with eggs. These items are made from <b>matzo</b> meal, or finely ground <b>matzo</b> {{sometimes}} called cake meal, used as a binder in baked goods. Some Ashkenazim do not cook with <b>matzo,</b> believing that mixing it with water may allow leavening; the mixture is called [...] "gebrochts" [...] by Ashkenazi Jews. Kosher for Passover cakes and cookies are made with <b>matzo</b> meal or a finer variety called [...] "cake meal", which gives them a denser texture than ordinary baked foods made with flour.|$|R
25|$|In {{the weeks}} before Passover, <b>matzos</b> are {{prepared}} for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups ("chaburas") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. Chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.|$|E
25|$|Josef Dunner took {{a leading}} role in {{promoting}} kashrus within his community. In his early years at the Adath and UOHC he chaired the Kashrus Committee (Kedassia), where he took a personal interest in seeing that all the requirements of halacha were met. He supervised personally the baking of machine <b>matzos</b> for the UOHC community, first at Bonn & Co in England and later at Ludmir's matzo bakery in Jerusalem, where he lost a finger in the process of meticulously checking the machinery.|$|E
25|$|The baking of matzo is labor-intensive, as only 18–22 {{minutes is}} {{permitted}} between {{the mixing of}} flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, {{only a small number}} of <b>matzos</b> can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to margarine, <b>matzo</b> {{was also in}} short supply for the 2008 Passover season, as were the Tam Tam <b>matzo</b> crackers manufactured by Manischewitz.Possible reasons for the <b>matzo</b> shortage included business decisions by the Trader Joe's and Costco chains not to stock <b>matzo</b> for 2008, and manufacturing problems at Manischewitz that forced the company to withhold Tam Tams for the year, and to produce less <b>matzo</b> {{and none of the}} more strictly made shmurah <b>matzo</b> preferred by many traditional Jews.|$|R
5000|$|Flavored {{varieties}} of <b>matzo</b> are produced commercially, such as poppy seed- or onion-flavored. Oat and spelt <b>matzo</b> with kosher certification are produced. Oat <b>matzo</b> is generally suitable {{for those who}} cannot eat gluten. Whole wheat, bran and organic <b>matzo</b> are also available. Chocolate-covered <b>matzo</b> is a favorite among children, although some consider it [...] "enriched matzo" [...] and will not eat it during the Passover holiday. A quite different flat confection of chocolate and nuts that resembles <b>matzo</b> is sometimes called [...] "chocolate matzo".|$|R
5000|$|Shĕmura ("guarded") <b>matzo</b> (מַצָּה שְׁמוּרָה matsa shĕmura) is {{made from}} grain that has been under special {{supervision}} from {{the time it was}} harvested to ensure that no fermentation has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. (Shĕmura wheat may be formed into either handmade or machine-made <b>matzo,</b> while non-shĕmura wheat is only used for machine-made <b>matzo.</b> It is possible to hand-bake <b>matzo</b> in shĕmura style from non-shmurah flour—this is a matter of style, it is not actually in any way shĕmura—but such <b>matzo</b> has rarely been produced since the introduction of machine-made <b>matzo.)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or <b>matzos.</b> After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Kalmanowitz is {{credited}} with securing the funds and papers to transfer the entire Mir yeshiva – consisting of 250 students, faculty members, and the yeshiva's entire library of sefarim – to Kobe, Japan in 1941 {{and from there to}} Shanghai, and providing for its upkeep for five years. Thanks to the money Kalmanowitz sent, Mir students were able to board with Jewish families and eat a nourishing Shabbat meal most of the time – privileges that other refugee students in Shanghai did not enjoy. In addition to money, Kalmanowitz sent <b>matzos</b> and wine for Passover, and hundreds of copies of Talmudic tractates so the students could continue studying without interruption. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the U.S. declared war on Japan, the Joint was prohibited from sending money to the yeshiva students in Shanghai. But Kalmanowitz established new contacts and influenced U.S. government officials to tacitly approve the sending of funds from the U.S. to Japan via neutral Switzerland. At war's end, Kalmanowitz obtained visas and travel fare to bring all the Mir students and faculty by ship to San Francisco and by train to New York; the last Mir refugee left Shanghai in 1948.|$|E
500|$|According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol {{provided}} {{an atmosphere that}} was [...] "socially religious", in which Jews [...] "combine piety with pleasure; they call their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor decorum; they want everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn a regularly ordained cantor." [...] In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his <b>matzos</b> for use on Passover.|$|E
50|$|Non-Passover <b>matzo</b> may be {{made with}} onion, garlic, poppy seed, etc. It can even be made from rice, maize, {{buckwheat}} and other non-traditional flours {{that can never be}} used for Passover <b>matzo.</b> Gluten-free matzo-lookalike made from potato starch, tapioca, and other non-traditional flour is available and may be eaten on Passover, but does not fulfill the commandment of eating <b>matzo,</b> even for people with celiac disease who cannot eat Passover <b>matzo,</b> because <b>matzo</b> must be made from one of the five grains (wheat, barley, oat, spelt, and rye), all of which contain gluten, except for most (but not all) types of oat <b>matzo.</b> Oat <b>matzo</b> may only be used by those who cannot have any other kind because it's not certain that oat is actually one of the five grains (it may be a mistranslation), so those who can have wheat <b>matzo</b> should do so.|$|R

500|$|The blood libel against Jews {{originated}} in England in 1144 {{with the case}} of William of Norwich. [...] The accusation that Jews used the blood of Christian children to prepare <b>matzos</b> for the Passover became a staple of Christian antisemitism of the Middle Ages, with {{the total number of}} recorded ritual murder accusations reaching 150. [...] With the strengthening of standards of evidence in legal cases, the number of charges began to decline, and few blood libel cases reached European courts after 1772. [...] Nevertheless, some instances of ritual murder accusation arose as late as the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|In 1840, {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} affair in Rhodes, a more famous case of blood libel, {{known as the}} Damascus affair, was developing in Damascus, while the city was under the short-lived control of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. On February 5, Capuchin friar Thomas and his servant Ibrahim Amara went missing, and the Jews of Damascus were accused of murdering them to collect their blood for Passover <b>matzos.</b> [...] The local Christian community, the governor, and the French consul, who received full support from Paris, actively pursued the ritual murder charge. The accused Jews were tortured, {{and some of them}} confessed to having killed Father Thomas and his servant. Their testimonies were used by the accusers as the irrefutable proof of guilt. The case drew international attention, arousing active protests from the European Jewish diaspora.|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{served as}} the synagogue's rabbi from his arrival in the United States in 1888 {{until his death in}} 1902 at age 62. During this time, his family slipped into poverty, as he did not receive his salary, which had been based on the {{anticipated}} taxes on kosher meats and vendors, and on <b>matzos.</b> After his death, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol secured the right to bury him in its cemetery by promising his widow $1,500 (today $) and a monthly $15 stipend; in turn, individuals offered the congregation large sums—$5,000 (today $) in one case—for the right to be buried near him. His funeral was attended by up to 100,000 mourners, [...] "clouded by the guilt-driven attempt of New York's Orthodox Jews to honor him for the last time, as partial compensation for the way they treated him during his life." ...|$|E
50|$|Note: The Tam Tam cracker {{started out}} as small, flavored <b>matzo,</b> but was {{developed}} into a unique recipe not made of <b>matzo</b> dough. The Passover version is still an egg <b>matzo</b> cracker, but year-round Tam Tam production is not.|$|R
50|$|Rakusen’s is a British kosher food {{manufacturer}} established in 1900 in Leeds, where {{it continues to}} operate today. Although {{best known for its}} <b>matzo,</b> <b>matzo</b> meal and <b>matzo</b> crackers, it also produces soups, beans, Tomor margarine, and other products.|$|R

500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, other synagogues in New York City often served a {{particular}} constituency, typically Jews {{from a single}} town in Russia, Poland, or Romania. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol prided itself in welcoming and assisting all Jews, regardless of origins. The synagogue's Passover Relief Committee—dedicated to providing funds and food to poor Jews {{so that they could}} properly celebrate the holiday of Passover—stated [...] "In dispensing money and <b>matzos</b> to the poor, all are recognized as the children of one Father, and no lines are drawn between natives of different countries." [...] By the turn of the 20th century, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was distributing approximately $800 (today $) a year to the poor for Passover supplies, compared to a total synagogue income of around $5,000 (today $). This was on top of its average $15 (today $) weekly contributions to the poor, and those of individual congregational members of around $2,000 (today $) per annum. By 1901, annual revenues were around $6,000 (today $), and the congregation had 150 members.|$|E
500|$|Ephraim Oshry, noted Torah {{scholar and}} {{religious}} {{leader in the}} Kovno Ghetto, {{and one of the}} few European Jewish legal decisors to survive The Holocaust, became the synagogue's rabbi in 1952, a post he retained for over 50 years. During the Holocaust the Nazis had made him the custodian of a warehouse that stored Jewish books intended for an exhibit of [...] "artifacts of the extinct Jewish race". He used the books to help him write responsa, answering questions asked of him regarding how Jews could live their lives in accordance with Jewish law under the extreme conditions imposed by the Nazis. He also ran [...] "secret nightly worship services", and helped Jews bake <b>matzos</b> for Passover, under threat of death if discovered. After the war he founded a yeshiva for Jewish orphans in Italy, and then another religious school in Montreal, before moving to New York to take up the position of rabbi at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. There, his Sunday afternoon lectures were so popular that the entire 1,200-seat sanctuary was filled, and the overflow had to sit on the stairs. While rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol, he founded another yeshiva in Monsey, New York for gifted high school aged boys.|$|E

25|$|A {{symbol of}} the Passover holiday is <b>matzo,</b> an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is {{continually}} worked from mixing through baking, {{so that it is}} not allowed to rise. <b>Matzo</b> may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat <b>matzo,</b> specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, <b>matzo)</b> during the entire week of Passover. Consequently, the eating of <b>matzo</b> figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.|$|R
2500|$|Shmura matzo ("watched" [...] or [...] "guarded" [...] matzo), is {{the bread}} of {{preference}} for the Passover Seder in Orthodox Jewish communities.

2500|$|The Kishinev pogrom {{took place}} in the capital of Bessarabia on April 6, 1903 after local {{newspapers}} published articles inciting the public to act against Jews; 47 or 49 Jews were killed, 92 severely wounded and 700 houses destroyed. The anti-Semitic newspaper Бессарабец (Bessarabetz, meaning [...] "Bessarabian"), published by Pavel Krushevan, insinuated that a Russian boy was killed by local Jews. Another newspaper, Свет (Lat. Svet, meaning [...] "World"), used the age-old blood libel against the Jews (alleging that the boy had been killed to use his blood in preparation of <b>matzos).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, the Israeli {{government}} {{issued a}} paper claiming that [...] "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard {{regularly in the}} government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," [...] {{to the extent that}} they are [...] "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA." [...] In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is [...] "going on all the time" [...] and that it is [...] "worrying and disturbing." [...] At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: [...] "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews." [...] In August 2014, the Hamas' spokesman in Doha said on live television that Jews use blood to make <b>matzos.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} forms of <b>matzo.</b> In many western {{countries}} {{the most common form}} is the hard form of <b>matzo</b> which is cracker-like in appearance and taste and is used in all Ashkenazic and most Sephardic communities. Yemenites, and Iraqi Jews traditionally made a form of soft <b>matzo</b> which looks like Greek pita or like a tortilla. Soft <b>matzo</b> is made only by hand, and generally with shmurah flour.|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1921 by the Ludmir {{family from}} Tzfat, {{they moved to}} Jerusalem in 1949.

2500|$|Jewish law prescribes that an olive-sized {{piece of}} <b>matzo</b> be eaten {{to fulfill the}} mitzvah of eating the afikoman. Many people eat an additional, olive-sized piece of <b>matzo</b> {{together}} with it. The first piece of <b>matzo</b> commemorates the Korban Pesach (Paschal lamb), whose meat was eaten {{at the very end}} of the festive Seder meal in the days that the Temple stood. The second piece commemorates the <b>matzo</b> that was eaten together with the meat of the Paschal Lamb in the days of the Temple, in fulfillment of the Torah commandment, [...] "They shall eat [...] together with <b>matzo</b> and maror" [...] (Exodus 12:8). Like the eating of the <b>matzo</b> earlier in the Seder, the afikoman is eaten while reclining to the left (in Orthodox Jewish circles, women and girls do not lean).|$|R
