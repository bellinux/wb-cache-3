5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> production and research.|$|E
25|$|The {{expected}} shortages {{with regard}} to Mo-99, and the technetium-99m <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> obtained from it, has also shed light onto linear accelerator technology to produce Mo-99 from non-enriched Uranium-235 through neutron bombardment. This would enable the <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> industry to manufacture this crucial isotope by a sub-critical process. The aging facilities, for example the Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario Canada, which still now produce most Mo-99 from highly enriched Uranium-235 could be replaced by this new process. In this way, the sub-critical loading of soluble uranium salts in heavy water with subsequent photo neutron bombardment and extraction of the target product, Mo-99, will be achieved.|$|E
25|$|The use of 131I as a <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> {{has been}} blamed for a routine {{shipment}} of biosolids being rejected from crossing the Canada—U.S. border. Such material can enter the sewers directly from the medical facilities, or by being excreted by patients after a treatment.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, AECL {{introduced}} the Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR-1000) atomic power reactor and Nordion the develop the unsuccessful Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment (MAPLE) atomic reactor, {{intended for the}} production of <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes.</b> This cancellation was one of the factors leading to a shortage of <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes</b> in 2007 and 2009.|$|R
50|$|With this {{promising}} start, AECL {{came to be}} a major world {{supplier of}} <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes,</b> using both the NRX reactor, and the NRU reactor, which came on-line in 1957. However, as these reactors began to age, it became clear that a new facility would be needed to continue the production of <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes.</b>|$|R
50|$|PNL neutron {{generator}} {{has been}} demonstrated to achieve over 1,000 hours of operation. The process produces <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes</b> that fit seamlessly into existing supply chains while eliminating the use of weapons-grade uranium and reliance on aging nuclear reactors. For example, the Canadian National Research Universal reactor (NRU) in Chalk River, Ontario currently produces these <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes.</b> In 2006, it produced 2/3 of the worlds technetium-99m. A 2009 shutdown of the NRU threatened to delay medical tests for cancer patients. Prior to the 2009 shutdown the NRU produced {{nearly half of the}} world's supply of <b>medical</b> <b>isotopes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactors (AHRs) use {{a solution}} of uranyl sulfate or other uranium salt in water. Historically, AHRs have all been small research reactors, not large power reactors. An AHR known as the <b>Medical</b> <b>Isotope</b> Production System is being considered for production of medical isotopes.|$|E
25|$|Those {{with more}} {{neutrons}} in the nucleus than those required for stability {{are known as}} proton-deficient, and tend to be most easily produced in a nuclear reactor. The majority of radiopharmaceuticals are based on proton deficient isotopes, with technetium-99m being {{the most commonly used}} <b>medical</b> <b>isotope,</b> and therefore nuclear reactors are the prime source of medical radioisotopes.|$|E
25|$|With the NRU reactor at the Chalk River Laboratories due {{to close}} in 2016, {{there was a need}} to find {{alternative}} sources of the <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> technetium-99m, a mainstay of nuclear medicine. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron LINAC to produce molybdenum-99, the parent isotope of technetium-99. As part of this project a 35MeV LINAC has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for photonuclear experiments with the SAL LINAC. First irradiations are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of Mo-99 started in Canada {{in the early}} 1970s and was shifted to the NRU reactor in the mid 1970s. By 1978 the reactor provided technetium-99m in large enough quantities that were processed by AECL's radiochemical division, which was privatized in 1988 as Nordion, now MDS Nordion. In the 1990s a substitution for the aging NRU reactor for {{production of}} radioisotopes was planned. The Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment (MAPLE) {{was designed as a}} dedicated isotope-production facility. Initially, two identical MAPLE reactors were to be built at Chalk River Laboratories, each capable of supplying 100% of the world's <b>medical</b> <b>isotope</b> demand. However, problems with the MAPLE 1 reactor, most notably a positive power co-efficient of reactivity, led to the cancellation of the project in 2008.|$|E
