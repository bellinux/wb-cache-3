The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout {{the world and into}} space. However, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that this feeling of helplessness, coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a <b>missile</b> <b>shield</b> composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine that Reagan and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the <b>missile</b> <b>shield.</b> The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2008, the U.S. and Poland {{agreed to}} have 10 {{two-stage}} missile interceptors – made by Orbital Sciences Corporation – placed in Poland, {{as part of a}} <b>missile</b> <b>shield</b> to defend Europe and the U.S. from a possible missile attack by Iran. In return, the U.S. agreed to move a battery of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Poland. The missile battery was to be staffed – at least temporarily – by U.S. Military personnel. The U.S. also pledged to defend Poland, a NATO member, quicker than NATO would {{in the event of an}} attack. Additionally, the Czech Republic recently agreed to allow the placement of a radar-tracking station in their country, despite public opinion polls showing that the majority of Czechs were against the plans and only 18% supported it. The radar-tracking station in the Czech Republic would also be part of the missile defense shield. After the agreement was announced, Russian officials said defences on Russia's borders would be increased and that they foresaw harm in bilateral relations with the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{findings}} of the commission generated mixed reactions among lawmakers, intelligence officers, and experts. [...] The intelligence community was privately angered by the harsh language the report used to describe their own assessments of the threat, although CIA Director George Tenet did not openly criticize it in public. [...] Congressional proponents of a national <b>missile</b> <b>shield,</b> especially Republicans, used the findings to further push their case that such a shield was necessary. However, some experts {{in and out of}} government questioned the usefulness of the report, saying that it made general speculations without reaching any definite conclusions.

40|$|Karl Marx used to {{say that}} history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. In line with this, the entire recent idea of a <b>missile</b> defense <b>shield</b> that the US has been willing to install in Eastern Europe is {{reminiscent}} of that of the Cold War era, when two major superpowers were targeting their strategic missiles towards each other. And although in 1972 both global powers agreed on not using anti-ballistic missiles, after two decades US had reexamined its thinking on the issue. The United States has decided to deploy radars and interceptors in the Czech Republic and Poland as part of a <b>missile</b> defense <b>shield</b> against possible Iranian or North Korean attacks. From the very start, Russia has been seeing the shield as directed towards itself. However, it doesn’t look like the installation of an American <b>missile</b> defense <b>shield</b> in Europe would lead to a major security crisis between the US and Russia since there is sufficient evidence of softening tensions as US-Russian high level negotiations go ahead. This is perhaps where the farce lies...|$|R

50|$|The Layner missile is {{a highly}} {{advanced}} derivative of the three-stage liquid-propelled R-29RMU Sineva SLBM, which was accepted into service in 2007.

This is twice the number of warheads the solid-propellant RSM-56 Bulava SLBM can carry, and, unlike those of the Sineva SLBM, these warheads can be of a mixed set with various yields. While it shares flight characteristics with the Sineva, the Layner is equipped with improved systems to overcome anti-ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>shields.</b> The <b>missile</b> can carry ten low-yield warheads with penetration aids, eight low-yield warheads with more penetration aids, four medium-yield warheads with penetration aids.|$|R
