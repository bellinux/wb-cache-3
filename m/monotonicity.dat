25|$|This later {{version is}} more general, having weaker conditions. The axioms of <b>monotonicity,</b> non-imposition, and IIA {{together}} imply Pareto efficiency, whereas Pareto efficiency (itself implying non-imposition) and IIA together do not imply <b>monotonicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|If a k-haven (with the <b>monotonicity</b> property) exists, {{then the}} evader may avoid being {{captured}} indefinitely, {{and win the}} game, by always moving to a vertex of '(X) where X is the set of vertices that will be occupied by pursuers {{at the end of}} the move. The <b>monotonicity</b> property of a haven guarantees that, when a new pursuer is added to a vertex of the graph, the vertices in '(X) are always reachable from the current position of the evader.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} {{limit on the}} right exists (finite or infinite) because, due to <b>monotonicity</b> (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), the {{sequence}} is non-decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{methods can}} {{also apply to}} {{functions}} that do not just use simple arithmetic, and we must also use other basic functions to redefine intervals, using already known <b>monotonicity</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|This {{inequality}} {{is called}} <b>Monotonicity</b> of quantum relative entropy. Owing to the Stinespring factorization theorem, this inequality {{is a consequence}} of a particular choice of the CPTP map - a partial trace map described below.|$|E
25|$|Because f(x) = e'x is {{guaranteed}} for rational x by the above properties (see below), one could also use <b>monotonicity</b> or other properties {{to enforce the}} choice of e'x for irrational x, but such alternatives appear to be uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Any {{homomorphism}} of lattices {{is necessarily}} monotone {{with respect to}} the associated ordering relation; see preservation of limits. The converse is not true: <b>monotonicity</b> by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins (see pic.9), although an order-preserving bijection is a homomorphism if its inverse is also order-preserving.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monotonicity,</b> or {{positive}} association {{of social and}} individual values: If any individual modifies his or her preference order by promoting a certain option, then the societal preference order should respond only by promoting that same option or not changing, never by placing it lower than before. An individual should {{not be able to}} hurt an option by ranking it higher.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} inconsistent with main axioms of rational choice theory, most notably with <b>monotonicity</b> axiom, stating that, if investing into portfolio X will, with probability one, return more money than investing into portfolio Y, then a rational investor should prefer X to Y. In contrast, modern portfolio theory {{is based on a}} different axiom, called variance aversion,-Criterion. Journal of economic theory, 69(2), 532-539.|$|E
25|$|T-norms are a {{generalization}} {{of the usual}} two-valued logical conjunction, studied by classical logic, for fuzzy logics. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The <b>monotonicity</b> property ensures {{that the degree of}} truth of conjunction does not decrease if the truth values of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as true (and consequently 0 as false). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reasonable}} to consider functions between partially ordered sets having certain additional properties {{that are related to}} the ordering relations of the two sets. The most fundamental condition that occurs in this context is <b>monotonicity.</b> A function f from a poset P to a poset Q is monotone, or order-preserving, if a ≤ b in P implies f(a) ≤ f(b) in Q (Noting that, strictly, the two relations here are different since they apply to different sets.). The converse of this implication leads to functions that are order-reflecting, i.e. functions f as above for which f(a) ≤ f(b) implies a ≤ b. On the other hand, a function may also be order-reversing or antitone, if a ≤ b implies f(b) ≤ f(a).|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} to STV {{have been proposed}} in order to pass <b>monotonicity</b> and other criteria. The most common method of proposed modification to STV is to alter {{the order in which}} candidates are eliminated: theoretically, a candidate who ranked second on every ballot could be the first candidate eliminated even if he is a Condorcet winner. Meek noted this problem in proposing his variation of transferring votes to nearly eliminate tactical voting in STV, however Meek himself did not propose a method for satisfying the Condorcet criterion. Other theorists have proposed further refinements of STV, such as using a Condorcet method to rank candidates for elimination order. Some of these modifications alter STV in a way such that it no longer reduces to instant-runoff voting when applied to a single seat but instead reduces to some other single winner system, such as a Condorcet method.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{analysis}} of voting {{systems such as}} STV generally centers on the voting system criteria that they pass. No preference voting system satisfies all the criteria described in Arrow's impossibility theorem: in particular, STV fails to achieve independence of irrelevant alternatives (like most other vote-based ordering systems) as well as <b>monotonicity.</b> Failure to satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives makes STV slightly prone to strategic nomination, albeit less so than with plurality methods where the spoiler effect is more pronounced and predictable. Non-monotonicity, in turn, makes it possible under some circumstances to elect a preferred candidate by reducing his position {{on some of the}} ballots; by helping elect a candidate who displaces the preferred candidate's main rival, a voter may cause the preferred candidate to profit from transfers resulting from the rival's defeat. STV fails the participation criterion which can result in a more favorable outcome to an STV voter by not voting at all. However, a voter who truncates a candidate off the ballot does not harm a ranked candidate, nor is another truncated candidate helped on the ballot.|$|E

[...] IRV does not meet this criterion. Allard claims failure is unlikely, at a less than 0.03% chance per election. Some critics argue in turn that Allard's calculations are wrong and the probability of <b>monotonicity</b> failure is much greater, at 14.5% under the impartial culture election model in the three-candidate case, or 7–10% {{in the case of a}} left-right spectrum.
