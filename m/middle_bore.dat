Plastic lane delineators were set in tubes within the pavement. With the touch of a button, water would fill tubes to cause the delineators to pop up from the pavement; the <b>middle</b> <b>bore</b> was closed to one direction of travel, while opening it to another. During the week, the <b>middle</b> <b>bore</b> of the Caldecott was reversed between 2:00 am and 5:00 am to favor westbound traffic, and then switched again sometime between 11:30 am and noon to favor eastbound traffic.

It was not uncommon to reverse the <b>middle</b> <b>bore</b> six times on a Saturday or Sunday.|$|E

50|$|Flora is a three-bore {{station with}} a short, 33 meter middle tunnel, 6 pairs of {{boarding}} zones and prefabricated, cast-iron panels {{on the station}} walls. It is 108 meters long and only 26 meters deep, {{making it one of}} the shallowest stations on the entire line. From the <b>middle</b> <b>bore,</b> an exit escalator goes through a tunnel to an underground vestibule (4.75 meters underground), which is attached to the shopping mall Palác Flora (2003). One can access Palác Flora by going through the immediate right exit after going up the escalator. There are six more exits from the vestibule to the street. The station is covered in gold and wine-colored die-cast aluminum panels, and also with decorative gray stone. Construction of the station cost 254 million Czechoslovak crowns.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method is presented for determination of styrene, toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene and n-propylbenzene in human body fluids by capillary gas chromatography (GC) with cryogenic oven trapping. After heating a blood or urine sample containing each compound and p-diethylbenzene (IS) in a 7. 0 -ml vial at 60 ℃ for 20 min, 5 ml of the headspace vapor was {{drawn into a}} glass syringe and injected into a GC port. All vapor was introduced into an Rtx-Volatile <b>middle</b> <b>bore</b> capillary column in the splitless mode at 20 ℃ of oven temperature to trap entire analytes, and then the oven temperature was programmed up to 280 ℃ for GC measurements by with flame ionization detection. The present conditions gave sharp peaks of each compound and IS, and low background noises for whole blood or urine samples. Each compound could be determined for rat whole blood after inhalation of gas of the five compounds. The present GC with cryogenic oven trapping is recommendable for use in determinations of styrene and related compounds in forensic and environmental toxicology, because it is simple, requires no special GC operations and gives high sensitivity and good separations. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|U–Pb zircon {{analyses}} from {{a series}} of orthogneisses sampled in drill core in the northern Gawler Craton provide crystallisation ages at ca 1775 – 1750 Ma, which is an uncommon age in the Gawler Craton. Metamorphic zircon and monazite give ages of ca 1730 – 1710 Ma indicating that the igneous protoliths underwent metamorphism during the craton-wide Kimban Orogeny. Isotopic Hf zircon data show that 1780 – 1750 Ma zircons are somewhat evolved with initial eHf values – 4 toþ 0. 9, and model ages of ca 2. 3 to 2. 2 Ga. Isotopic whole rock Sm–Nd values from most samples have relatively evolved initial eNd values of – 3. 7 to – 1. 4. In contrast, a mafic unit from drill hole <b>Middle</b> <b>Bore</b> 1 has a juvenile isotopic signature with initial eHf zircon values of caþ 5. 2 toþ 8. 2, and initial eNd values of *þ 3. 5 toþ 3. 8. The presence of 1775 – 1750 Ma zircon forming magmatic rocks in the northern Gawler Craton provides a possible source for similarly aged detrital zircons in Paleoproterozoic basin systems of the Gawler Craton and adjacent Curnamona Province. Previous provenance studies on these Paleoproterozoic basins have appealed to the Arunta Region of the North Australian Craton to provide 1780 – 1750 Ma detrital zircons, and isotopically and geochemically similar basin fill. The orthogneisses in the northern Gawler Craton also match the source criteria and display geochemical similarities between coeval magmatism in the Arunta Region of the North Australian Craton, providing further support for paleogeographic reconstructions that link the Gawler Craton and North Australian Craton during the Paleoproterozoic.

50|$|Both Walsdorf and the {{formerly}} separate centre of Zilsdorf lay under the Imperially immediate {{ownership of the}} Dukes of Arenberg in the <b>Middle</b> Ages. They <b>bore</b> three cinquefoils (this device is so-called in English heraldry, but the German blazon describes them as Mispelblüten, German for common medlar blossoms) in the same tinctures in which they appear in Walsdorf’s arms (and the field in their arms was of the same tincture as the bend sinister in Walsdorf’s arms). These cinquefoils now appear as a charge in the municipal arms to recall this era in the municipality’s history. The annulet is Saint Arnulf’s attribute and the lily Saint Anthony’s, thus representing the municipality’s two patron saints, the former being Walsdorf’s and the latter Zilsdorf’s. In each case, the saint is both the village’s and the church’s patron.|$|R

[...] Aemilia is not known to have had sisters, but younger sisters are sometimes more notable for the historical record than the elder.

60|$|I do {{not think}} any {{reasonable}} person can doubt that the evils {{of power in the}} present system are vastly greater than is necessary, nor that they might be immeasurably diminished by a suitable form of Socialism. A few fortunate people, it is true, are now enabled to live freely on rent or interest, and they could hardly have more liberty under another system. But the great bulk, not only of the very poor, but, of all sections of wage-earners and even of the professional classes, are the slaves of the need for getting money. Almost all are compelled to work so hard that they have little leisure for enjoyment or for pursuits outside their regular occupation. Those who are able to retire in later <b>middle</b> age are <b>bored,</b> because they have not learned how to fill their time when they are at liberty, and such interests as they once had apart from work have dried up. Yet these are the exceptionally fortunate: the majority have to work hard till old age, with the fear of destitution always before them, the richer ones dreading that they will be unable to give their children the education or the medical care that they consider desirable, the poorer ones often not far removed from starvation. And almost all who work have no voice in the direction of their work; throughout the hours of labor they are mere machines carrying out the will of a master. Work is usually done under disagreeable conditions, involving pain and physical hardship. The only motive to work is wages: the very idea that work might be a joy, like the work of the artist, is usually scouted as utterly Utopian.|$|R
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the <b>boring</b> <b>middle</b> child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|R
60|$|To {{appreciate}} the full truth of this passage, {{we must understand}} another effect peculiar to the rain-cloud, that its openings exhibit the purest blue which the sky ever shows. For, {{as we saw in}} the first chapter of this section, that aqueous vapor always turns the sky more or less gray, it follows that we never can see the azure so intense as when the greater part of this vapor has just fallen in rain. Then, and then only, pure blue sky becomes visible in the first openings, distinguished especially by {{the manner in which the}} clouds melt into it; their edges passing off in faint white threads and fringes, through which the blue shines more and more intensely, till the last trace of vapor is lost in its perfect color. It is only the upper white clouds, however, which do this, or the last fragments of rain-clouds, becoming white as they disappear, so that the blue is never corrupted by the cloud, but only paled and broken with pure white, the purest white which the sky ever shows. Thus we have a melting and palpitating color, never the same for two inches together, deepening and broadening here and there into intensity of perfect azure, then drifted and dying away through every tone of pure pale sky, into the snow white of the filmy cloud. Over this roll the determined edges of the rain-clouds, throwing it all far back, as a retired scene, into the upper sky. Of this effect the old masters, as far as I remember, have taken no cognizance whatsoever; all with them is, as we partially noticed before, either white cloud or pure blue: they have no notion of any double-dealing or <b>middle</b> measures. They <b>bore</b> a hole in the sky, and let you up into a pool of deep, stagnant blue, marked off by the clear round edges of imperturbable, impenetrable cloud on all sides--beautiful in positive color, but totally destitute of that exquisite gradation and change, that fleeting, panting, hesitating effort, with which the first glance of the natural sky is shed through the turbulence of the earth-storm.|$|R
60|$|After all, {{what the}} {{imitative}} arts really give us are merely the various styles of particular artists, or of certain schools of artists. Surely you don't {{imagine that the}} people of the <b>Middle</b> Ages <b>bore</b> any resemblance at all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass, or in mediaeval stone and wood carving, or on mediaeval metal-work, or tapestries, or illuminated MSS. They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with nothing grotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance. The Middle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form of style, {{and there is no reason}} at all why an artist with this style should not be produced in the nineteenth century. No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist. Take an example from our own day. I know that you are fond of Japanese things. Now, do you really imagine that the Japanese people, as they are presented to us in art, have any existence? If you do, you have never understood Japanese art at all. The Japanese people are the deliberate self-conscious creation of certain individual artists. If you set a picture by Hokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters, beside a real Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not the slightest resemblance between them. The actual people who live in Japan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say, they are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them. In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention. There is no such country, there are no such people. One of our most charming painters {3} went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the Japanese. All he saw, all he had the chance of painting, were a few lanterns and some fans. He was quite unable to discover the inhabitants, as his delightful exhibition at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well. He did not know that the Japanese people are, as I have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite fancy of art. And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will not behave like a tourist and go to Tokio. On the contrary, you will stay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists, and then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught their imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in the Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely Japanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere. Or, to return again to the past, take as another instance the ancient Greeks. Do you think that Greek art ever tells us what the Greek people were like? Do you believe that the Athenian women were like the stately dignified figures of the Parthenon frieze, or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building? If you judge from the art, they certainly were so. But read an authority, like Aristophanes, for instance. You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore high-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged their faces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of our own day. The fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through the medium of art, and art, very fortunately, has never once told us the truth.--The Decay of Lying.|$|R
