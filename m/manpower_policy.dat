They emphasized men’s breadwinner role and responsible fatherhood over military service and defined economic independence as a contribution to national defense. These policies, therefore, militarized the civilian sector, as fatherhood and certain civilian occupations were defined as national defense initiatives. But these policies also, ironically, weakened the citizen-soldier ideal by ensuring that fewer men would serve in the military and equating these civilian pursuits with military service. The Defense establishment unintentionally weakened its own manpower procurement system. These findings provide context for the anti-war and anti-draft protest of the late 1960 s and early 1970 s.

In 1971 Nixon proceeded with the tax cuts under the provisions of phase II of the Economic Stabilization Act as it was amended earlier that year. It was believed by Nixon that America needed a comprehensive <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> to bring power back to the United States economy. There was no greater proof that America lacked strong manpower than the economic mishaps of the 1960s that lead to the recession that Nixon inherited. Nixon, along with the Economic Stabilization act, referenced the Manpower Development and Training act of 1962 to utilize the competence of America's workforce and the Manpower Revenue Sharing Act, to make such manpower training programs accessible to local governments to [...] "administer".

This little joke seemed to satisfy, so he was promptly assigned to the assembly line as a metal finisher, the same job he had mastered in the early 1940s when working in Buffalo."

At the direction of the President' the Coast Guard passed to the control of the Secretary of the Navy on November 1, 1941 and so remained until January 1, 1946. On September 1, 1942, Samuels received the following notification from Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox: [...] "Pursuant to the provision of an Act of Congress approved July 24, 1941, (Public Law No. 188 - 77th Congress), the President of the United States on this date appoints you a Boatswain in the Coast Guard for temporary service to rank from the First of September 1942", thus Samuels was able to work himself up through the ranks to become a warrant officer.

40|$|Dans le présent article, les auteurs tentent de situer la place de la politique de main-d'oeuvre à l'intérieur de l’éventail des différentes politiques publiques, notamment les politiques économiques et les politiques sociales. This paper {{tries to}} {{identify}} the place of <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> in the spectrum of public policies, and more particularly economic and social policies. A <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> exists {{in relation to the}} labour market and, more specifically, labour market problems. The objective of <b>manpower</b> <b>policy,</b> in such a context, is to correct labour market problems and operating difficulties in a preventive or curative manner. Many public policies can influence one or more aspects of the phenomenon of work and therefore the labour market. On the other hand, the efficiency of many specific instruments of economic or social policies depends largely on the efficiency of work and therefore of the labour market. This suggests the dynamic interdependency and complementarity between <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> and economic and social policies. To better distinguish between different public policies it becomes necessary to try to determine the zone of performance of each of them, in the interest of better policy making and implementation. Public policy is defined here as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to improve the functioning of society or of a particular group of Society. Such state intervention has become necessary since it has been proven that a certain number of problems cannot find a solution by themselves. The State can intervene by a series of instruments. It has been chosen to focus on the following: economic, social and education policies. Economic policy is defined as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to improve the economic functioning of society or of a particular group of society. The effects of such a policy are not solely economic and are not necessarily equal for everyone. Nor are they equal for all parts of the territory. There is therefore a need of more specific complementary instruments aiming at solving particular problems for given groups and/or given regions. Social policy is defined as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to insure income protection and to supply assistance to particular groups facing particular problems, in order to allow them to function "normally" in society. To the extent that such income protection and specific assistance are sought through the labour market, the interdependency and complementarity between social and manpower policies become obvious. The education policy is defined by the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to encourage, for each citizen, the acquisition of knowledge and skills. To the extent that such knowledge and skills are essential ingredients for the functioning of individuals on the labour market, the interdependency and complementarity between education and manpower policies become obvious. <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> is defined as the set of decisions and actions taken by the State to improve the functioning of the labour market. As such, <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> has economic and social dimensions. <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> cannot by itself find a solution to all labour market problems since the labour market is influenced by other public policies. <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> must therefore adjust to other public policies, and vice versa, in order to maximize labour market functioning. <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> therefore, plays a complementary role purely in the short or medium term because of the dynamics of the labour market, and because the long term aspect of the labour market is mostly in the spectrum of other public policies. In such a context, a grey zone between <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> and other public policies is inevitable. The most important difference between <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> and economic policy is that the former aims at offering selective actions for given groups with specific characteristics. Since the most important function of social policy is income protection, its link with <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> is such that <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> seeks to insure a more equitable distribution of opportunities for individuals on the labour market and a better quality of professional life. In the matter of skill and knowledge acquisition, the education policy mainly touches the consumption aspect of education, except perhaps for skill training of youth within the normal schooling network. Because of its nature, <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> then mainly touches the short and medium investment aspect of adult education. However, the subjective difference between investment in education and consumption of education makes it more difficult to generalize as to the specific zones of performance of education and manpower policies. It is therefore possible to offer a certain number of general criteria to help determine if such and such public policy instrument having an effect on the labour market is part of the zone of performance of <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> or not. a) <b>manpower</b> <b>policy</b> instruments- correspond to a specific need in the labour market;- direct and selective;- focus in the short and medium termb) Other public policy instruments- correspond to a general need of society or of a particular group but not for labour market purposes;- mainly macro;- direct in the long term;- indirect in the medium and long term. c) Grey zone instruments- direct, intended and controled but belonging to another public policy than <b>manpower</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

Following recent discussions of the problem, this paper is concerned with a critical review of Canadian <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> in the context of national efficiency, regional equity and their interaction. Thus <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> is analyzed with respect to its implications concerning regional development as well as implicit regional policy. It is contended that many of the problems of <b>Manpower</b> <b>policy</b> in the spatial context {{can be traced back to}} the implicit theoretical background of Manpower policy; Human Capital theory. A radical critique of Human Capital theory is presented and a brief discussion of the 'functional' relationship between regional inequality and national macro-planning is also noted. In general the paper concludes that Manpower and regional policies in Canada tend to be contradictory although more research is needed to analyze the spatial impact of macro-policy which may overwhelm spatial policy and significantly influence the future of the spatial economy.
