500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In several {{episodes of}} the HBO series The Sopranos (e.g., [...] "Mayham" [...] and [...] "The Fleshy Part of the Thigh"), Tony Soprano recovers from a gunshot wound. He {{reflects}} on an Ojibwe saying left by his bed: [...] "Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, {{and all the}} while, a great wind carries <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the sky".|$|E
2500|$|Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have {{confirmed}} in separate interviews {{that they did}} not get along with each other during the making of What About Bob? In addition, the film's producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led to him tossing her into a lake. [...] Ziskin confirmed in 2003, [...] "Bill also threatened to throw <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. [...] I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior." ...|$|E

2500|$|Certain Germans helped {{prisoners in}} their escape attempts. During his second try, Robert d'Harcourt hid in a warehouse, where a German found him. The latter did not {{denounce}} him, instead helping him {{leave the city}} that night: “ then he guided <b>me</b> <b>across</b> a maze of back-alleys and yards, through which I would never have found my way alone, until {{the entrance to a}} street where he left me, not without first vigorously shaking my hand and wishing me good luck." [...] The sympathy of women is equally remarked upon by Riou and d'Harcourt. Once the escape was successful, the prisoner was sent to his regimental barracks to undergo an interrogation. In effect, the home authorities had to make sure the escape was authentic and not a spy trick. If the operation failed, the escapee was taken back to the camp to be punished. The frustration generated by failure very often led the recaptured prisoner to develop plans for the next attempt; this was the case for Charles de Gaulle and Robert d’Harcourt. Of 313,400 escapes counted for the war’s duration, 67,565 succeeded.|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Then pray let <b>me</b> walk <b>across</b> the park!' {{she said}} imploringly; and Miss Charlecote yielded {{rather than try}} her {{submission}} too severely, though dreading her over-fatigue, and set off with Phoebe in the fly.|$|R
60|$|Then the horrid truth flashed {{suddenly}} <b>across</b> <b>me.</b> Lemarchant {{was trying}} to poison me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please go {{and have}} a whisky and soda in the smoking-room," [...] she said, {{pointing}} to the open French windows. [...] "I am going to my favourite seat. You will find <b>me</b> just <b>across</b> the bridge there." ...|$|R

60|$|Lord Roxton said nothing, but a brown {{hand was}} {{stretched}} out to <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the table.|$|E
60|$|He {{bent and}} touched her hand with his lips, as Adèle leaned forward and laughed at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is what I {{have been}} wanting all the time," [...] said I, and then without more ado {{the little white}} figure rose and flung itself at me. For {{the rest of the}} night he lay on <b>me</b> and <b>across</b> <b>me,</b> and {{sometimes}} his feet were at the bottom of the bed and sometimes on the pillow, but he always retained possession of my finger, and occasionally he woke me to say that he was sleeping with me. I had not a good night. I lay thinking.|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, Between the Buried and <b>Me</b> toured <b>across</b> North America with Cynic, Devin Townsend, and Scale the Summit. Afterwards, they {{traveled}} to Europe supporting Lamb of God, along with Job for a Cowboy and August Burns Red.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{remember}} Thorns firing doubts at <b>me</b> obliquely <b>across</b> the table. [...] "You can't run {{a country}} through its spoilt children," [...] he said. [...] "What you call aristocrats are really spoilt children. They've {{had too much}} of everything, except bracing experience." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a pause}} {{during which}} he looked at her, whilst the men were roughly {{dragging}} <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the hall.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} big {{head from the}} pile of karosses on which he was lying and peered at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the fire.|$|E
60|$|She looked long {{away from}} <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the lagoon {{and at last}} sighed, like one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.|$|E
60|$|I swooned away, and, as I {{sank into}} oblivion, there leapt from {{the lips of}} the {{thousands}} I had betrayed that awful roar of scorn and fury which has hunted me from my home and still haunts <b>me</b> far <b>across</b> the seas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do, uncle," [...] the lad exclaimed, leaping to {{his feet}} in his excitement. [...] "I promise you I would not give you any trouble; and as for marching, there isn't a man in Nithsdale who can tire <b>me</b> out <b>across</b> the mountains." ...|$|R

60|$|She led <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the lawn, {{along the}} same path by which I had {{followed}} her {{on the day after}} my arrival at Limmeridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "None whatever---at once, if you like. This way, my dear Sir; this way," [...] and he led <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the passage, {{into the}} dining-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "We couldn't. You wouldn't {{expect him}} to shout at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the railing! Only, {{whenever}} I walked round the deck, {{he seemed to be}} there." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{collapsed}} beside Dragomiroff, broken and snivelling feebly, because I had been delivered before {{my time to}} all the terrors of Judgment Day, and the Archangels of the Resurrection were hailing <b>me</b> naked <b>across</b> the Universe {{to the sound of}} the music of the spheres.|$|R
60|$|Down {{into the}} chamber he dragged <b>me,</b> and <b>across</b> it to the side {{opposite}} that at which we had entered. Here was another doorway leading into a corridor which ran directly down a steep incline. Without a moment's hesitation Woola jerked me along this rocky passage.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in her quivering old voice {{that for a moment}} took <b>me</b> back <b>across</b> an epoch, to the protests of the former time, to those counsels of submission, those appeals not to offend It, that had always stirred an angry spirit of rebellion within me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you do. You remind me of my country itself--of the things that wait for <b>me</b> <b>across</b> the ocean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you dear little thing, I'm {{very glad}} to see you; but I'm sure you can't help <b>me</b> <b>across</b> this desert," [...] said Rosy, {{stroking}} its soft back.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would do}} for me, very well," [...] Bob said. [...] "Nothing could be better. What charge would you make, for taking <b>me</b> <b>across</b> and {{bringing}} me back, tomorrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|He did not move. Neither dared I, for he {{was within}} {{a few feet of}} <b>me.</b> Adèle came <b>across</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|He {{had backed}} me around so that I {{stood in front}} of the corpse of his fellow, and then he rushed me {{suddenly}} so that I was forced back upon it, and as my heel struck it the impetus of my body flung <b>me</b> backward <b>across</b> the dead man.|$|R
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{turned her face}} full on <b>me,</b> and {{reaching}} <b>across</b> the table, laid her hand firmly on my arm.|$|R
