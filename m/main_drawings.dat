The eucalypt forest and then the rainforest, marked on <b>Main</b> Roads working <b>drawings</b> as [...] "vine scrub" [...] or [...] "jungle", had to be manually cleared. Initially, the only mechanical aids were a few trucks, two tractors and two air compressors, with cuttings being blasted through the granite with gelignite and most work being done with picks and shovels. After the trees were cleared, horse-drawn ploughs broke up the softer earth, while horse-drawn scoops, wheelbarrows or mining trolleys on portable lengths of track removed the overburden. [...] "Tumbling tommies", small scoops that were towed behind the crawler tractors, were used later on.|$|R

Three primary sources, the first dated 1530, {{make it possible to}} chart the evolution of the collection {{over the last two decades}} of Vendramin's life, to identify important works which it contained, to recognize the high value attached to the drawings and to understand how they were presented and conserved. The most important source, the inventory composed between 1567 and 1569, has not previously been fully scrutinized from the point of view of the drawings. The collection included works attributed to Raphael, Jacopo and Giovanni Bellini, Mantegna, Parmigianino and Domenico Campagnola. Drawings were not the only objects Vendramin collected, or indeed the <b>main</b> ones. Collecting <b>drawings</b> was still a new activity in the early sixteenth century and evaluating Vendramin's practices and priorities helps to illuminate this formative period. © 2013 The Author...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Mechanical and {{aerospace}} engineering. The {{research and development}} (R&D) of coal log compaction machines {{is very important for}} commercializing tl 1 e new technology of coal log pipeline (CLP). The CLP technology will be successful commercially only if the machine can produce high-quality, low-cost coal logs at a high production rate. In this thesis, a commercial scale rotary press for compacting coal logs and biomass logs is designed. This machine is not a small, conventional tablet rotary press used by the pharmaceutical industry. It {{is one of the largest}} rotary presses in the world. This machine provides a maximum of 250 -ton compaction force, and can produce coal logs of 5. 4 inches in diameter and 10 inches in length. The designed production rate is 3, 600 logs per hour or one log per second. Because of the large friction force and the long stroke, the design of such a machine is very challenging. In order to satisfy all design requirements and overcome technical problems, the critical components such as the cam, the punches, the turret, the feeding system, and the power train are carefully analyzed and designed. The design also incorporates special features learned from coal log compaction studies such as the backpressure during ejection of logs from mold. The cost estimation for this design is also conducted. As a result of the preliminary design, a set of assemblies, subassemblies, and <b>main</b> part <b>drawings</b> is provided with this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study has}} {{concentrated}} on the analysis of architectural spaces of the movie “Dodes-ka-den”, about slow-pace child by Kurosawa, based on three principle Lacanian orders i,e Imaginary, Symbolic and Real. Lacan considers these three orders as three ways of expressing human reality and he usually identifies reality as a combination of symbolic and imaginary order. An especial space of imagination, symbolism and reality is dominant throughout the movie where the architectural space {{is one of its}} principle elements. The research method is analytical-descriptive with a combination of quantitative (from theory to case) and qualitative (from case to theory) analysis. The research gets to this conclusion that Kurosawa intended to make a movie based on these three orders by Lacan and he has been influenced by Lacan’s viewpoints when designing the scenes, inner architecture, perspective and sense of space. He considers Lacan’s three orders in spaces related to Rokkuchan (film’s <b>main</b> character) i’e <b>drawings,</b> continuous movement space, space of calmness and also mirrorstage space and in these plots he describing architectural space.

Proposal was taken from my 3 rd semester studio work and {{it was necessary to}} do some modifications during this work. Final building design is too large, so the <b>main</b> technical <b>drawings</b> were made only for one part. Whole building is solved only in the term of architecture proposal and drawings of situation, basement floorplan and elevations. The new building of the art school in Brno is located in the north-east hillside of Kraví hora near the center of Brno. Shape of the building is {{based on the idea that}} park will continue across the whole plot and the school becomes part of it. Main idea of proposal is leaving as much space as possible to surrounding green areas. By placing big part of volume under the ground, school becomes more connected to the park around and it enables students and all the other people to spend some time. Proposal is placed in the plot near to the planetarium to create education complex in the middle of emerging big park area on Kraví hora. Lots of areas such as multifunctional halls, snack bar or exhibition space are placed into one-storey block volume with generous construction height. This block is whole under the ground in the one side and the rest of it is gradually coming up on the terrain. There are 3 other organic shaped objects rising up from this volume. Roof of the main part can be entered from each side, so that park actually continues across this surface without any barriers. Skylights providing light to the bottom hall are also suitable for sitting, so they can be used as benches...|$|R

Declared as records of the <b>main</b> character with <b>drawings,</b> it doesn't apply for serious research of the teenage environment — it more likely a look from within for a while which as if stopped at the birth of heroes in 1979. Eighteen-year-old Rustem, unlike the business little sister Madina, is lazy and inert, {{he looks at the}} world cold eyes, having hidden behind the indifferent relation to people around. The strange girl Miko shy tries to destroy Rustem's rest by fragile feeling of the first love. Almost all actors, screenwriters (second-year students of masterful direction of game cinema of Ardak Amirkulov), artists, operators — graduates or students of Kazakh National Academy of Arts. In the movie scenes from the performance [...] "The Brothers Karamazov" [...] are used. Amirkulov enters the movie in a cinema context, having remembered not only Nugmanov film [...] "The Needle", but also Daneliya film [...] "Walking the Streets of Moscow" [...] and Ioseliani film [...] "There lived a song thrush", beating through motive of the last fortieth anniversary — the city aimless wanderings of the hero behaving to finding, but coinciding often with finding of death.|$|R

This study {{concerns}} {{the assessment of}} the racial awareness and attitudes (intra- and interpersonal) {{of a small group of}} Sub A children in a recently racially desegregated school in Cape Town in 1991. This issue was seen to be of importance in South Africa because of changes within the educational sector whereby many schools were in the process of becoming racially desegregated. A case study design and methodology was used in both the pilot and <b>main</b> studies. Three <b>drawings</b> together with collateral information were obtained from each of the twenty-five children. The measurement instruments used were the Human Figure Drawing (HFD), the Kinetic School Drawing (KSD) and an instrument which was devised by the researcher during the pilot study, namely the Peer Group Drawing. Data analysis involved each drawing being analysed separately according to the analysis systems of Klepsch and Logie (1982), and Koppitz (1968), and further informed by Burns (1982) and Furth (1988). Within subject comparisons were undertaken which resulted in the data being clustered into four groups. The grouped data was then analysed and interpreted in terms of the aim of the study. Findings generally concurred with the literature: the children were found to be racially aware and held definite racial attitudes, and these were related to socio-cognitive and affective development. More than half of the subjects were found to be experiencing difficulties which in some cases could be clearly linked to adjusting to classroom desegregation. A central recommendation was for active mediation by educators and psychologists in the process of transition from desegregation to integration...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a practice-based inquiry into {{contemporary}} Reportage Drawing in the UK. The {{role of the}} practice in present day, its various forms and purposes and how digital media has influenced both the working process and reception of such work, is discussed through comparisons of visual work and theoretical engagement from practitioners. Verbal and visual contributions from current artists about their methods, means and motivations are included to present {{a clear picture of}} the varied forms of documentary drawing. This research is structured around questions and issues raised about the process of Reportage Drawing from original reportage drawings made observing everyday life in Kisumu, western Kenya. It begins with a brief historical overview of Reportage Drawing and develops with chapters visually engaging with the drawings from Kisumu and other artist's contirbutions. The <b>main</b> body of <b>drawings</b> is designed to be viewed as a visual display as specific groups of drawings create a dialogue about the various issues raised. At the heart of this research is the investigation into observational drawing, the presence of the reportage artist as a documenter of the every day and the question of the importance of this specific field of art. Attention is paid to the practical aspects of making work as this often influences artists' choice in engaging in this form of drawing while reasons behind the commissioning of reportage artists are also elaborated on. This all contributes to the objectives of this thesis, which is to create the start of a database of contemporary reportage artists, present a clear picture of the nature of reportage drawing in' present day, including its limitations, and reflect on my own work in the light of others' while championing this practice...|$|R
