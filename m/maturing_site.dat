40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{narrative}} historical {{study was to explore}} how the Nebraska Writing Project, over a course of approximately twenty-five years, interpreted and employed the National Writing Project model designed by James Gray of the University of California at Berkley (formerly known as the Bay Area Writing Project) at a <b>maturing</b> <b>site.</b> A thorough review of the literature provided a basic history of the development of the National Writing Project and eight components of the national model. Additionally, the research provided foundational information for instructional leadership and a deeper understanding of institutional culture. ^ This study was intended to be significant to researchers and practitioners alike as it investigated the evolution of a <b>maturing</b> <b>site</b> within a national program. To the educational researcher, this paper should provide a rich portrait of the Nebraska Writing Project and its history, a portrait currently relegated to the memories of past-participants and directors rather than the archives of the institution. ^ For practitioners, the significance lies in several areas including an archival resource, knowledge of common and differentiated practice, and insight into the development of a longitudinal program. Implications may influence future institutes, generate individual reflections and further the mission of continuity between the teachers and the Nebraska Writing Project within Nebraska. In addition, the conclusion answers research questions about history as it applies to both collective and individual identities. Theoretical literature provided an impetus into the thoughts and tenets of the directors including leadership styles, collegial relationships and affiliations, and the academic culture of the site. ^ Divided into five chapters, this study 2 ̆ 7 s Chapter I introduces the historical context and development of the NWP, leadership styles, and cultures within academic institutions as well as acknowledging the assumptions and procedures for the study. Additional materials can be found in several appendixes. Chapters II–IV reconstruct three phases of the NeWP as developed by individual directors, pictures of the project, implementation of the NWP tenets and relationships with other projects before formulating some conclusions. Chapter V summarizes the historical narrative and articulates opportunities for future research. Therefore, findings of this study include: a historical framework; highlights the importance of the directorship on institutional culture and history; and provides a foundation for future research. ...|$|E

The mature forest with larger leaf area and wetter and cooler soils has a net uptake of carbon 3. 3 times that of the young plantation. In the spring, photosynthesis is larger at the <b>mature</b> <b>site</b> as expected based on the difference in leaf area, however, another important factor is the reduction in springtime respiration at the <b>mature</b> <b>site</b> due to lower soil temperatures because of more shade from the canopy. Patterns of photosynthesis, inherent water-use efficiency (IWUE) and tree transpiration indicate that the young plantation responds to the seasonal drought sooner and to a more severe degree. Lower sensitivity to seasonal drought at the <b>mature</b> <b>site</b> is likely due to higher soil moisture reserves year round and a deeper root system that can access more water. Outside the seasonal drought period, the IWUE is the same at both sites, suggesting a species-specific value.

However, effects of {{broadcast burning}} on ectomycorrhizae (ECM), which facilitate nutrient and energy cycling within forests, is poorly understood. Difficulties include a complex soil environment and uncertainties in ECM identification. To determine effects of broadcast burning following clearcutting on the diversity and abundance (percent colonization) of ectomycorrhizal fungi, morphological and molecular (PCR-RFLP) methods were used to assess naturally regenerating and outplanted hybrid white spruce seedlings growing in clearcut, clearcut plus burned, and adjacent <b>mature</b> <b>sites</b> in the Interior of British Columbia. Morphological characterization resulted in 24 fungal morphotypes. Significant treatment effects and seedling differences occurred between naturally regenerating seedlings in clearcut and <b>mature</b> <b>sites</b> and between naturally regenerating and planted seedlings in clearcut sites. The abundance of some morphotypes differed on planted seedlings in clearcut compared with clearcut plus burned sites and for planted seedlings in treated (clearcut and clearcut plus burned) compared with regenerating seedlings in untreated (<b>mature)</b> <b>sites.</b> A Russulaceae type and Thelephora were the most abundant morphotypes on regenerating seedlings in the <b>mature</b> and clearcut <b>sites,</b> respectively. Molecular characterization showed no significant differences for treatment effects or seedling type. Amplification of the ITS region for eight commonly occurring morphotypes revealed 12 genotypes (having a shared band pattern for one or none of three restriction endonucleases) with 18 variants (having similar band patterns for two restriction endonucleases). Cenococcum, Tuber, Hebeloma and Thelephora had only one genotype, however, Amphinema, E-strain, MRA, and a Russulaceae type each exhibited two or three genotypes. Morphology showed differences in occurrence and abundance of some ECM fungi following clearcutting, and clearcutting plus burning, suggesting that disturbance may be altering the fungal composition of hybrid white spruce seedlings on these sites towards ECM best able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Using both characterization techniques provided a comprehensive estimate of diversity, specifically for total species richness when using morphology, and for increased understanding of inter- and intra-specific variation with respect to molecular characterization of ectomycorrhizal associations.

Bank strength and erosion risk assessment [...] 6. Discussion [...] 7. Conclusion. Geomorphic {{processes such as}} erosion {{play a critical role}} in the development of existing river channels, as well as the formation of new channels by avulsion in multi-channelled systems. The Macquarie Marshes is an anastomosing and distributary system that supports extensive floodplain wetlands through overbank flooding and channel erosion poses a threat to these sensitive ecosystems. Four sites within the Southern Macquarie Marshes were investigated to identify the dominant patterns, processes and rates of erosion that contribute to channel change and to establish an evolutionary sequence of channel development. Channel incision and narrowing were the dominant processes measured together with knickpoint retreat at the three less <b>mature</b> <b>sites,</b> while channel widening and stabilisation were characteristic of the most <b>mature</b> <b>site.</b> Significant differences in channel morphometrics including width, depth and cross sectional area were found at the four sites using data from 2008 and 2014. The sites and their erosion processes fit into a geomorphic and evolutionary sequence: (1) knickpoint retreat and incision in a small swamp outflow channel (Buckiinguy); (2) incision and widening in a large swamp outflow channel (Willancorah); (3) minor incision and widening in the upper and lower reaches of a shallow, continuous marsh channel (Pillicawarrina); and(4) minimal erosion and channel stabilisation in a well-established, continuous marsh channel (The Breakaway). Bank strength is a key factor that contributes to erosion potential in the system, and sediment moisture content affects bank strength. Other factors (organic content, sand, silt and clay content, dry bulk density) have very weak relationships with bank strength. A trend was found where more <b>mature</b> <b>sites</b> have higher bank strength, probably related to the extent of past erosion. A conceptual geomorphic model shows how erosion affects the development and formation of new channels during avulsion, and the effects on longitudinal and lateral connectivity in systems like the Macquarie Marshes, by redistributing water and sediment within the wetlands. The formation of channels by erosion plays a critical role in the evolution of anastomosing and distributary systems.

We described patterns in community composition, vegetation cover, diversity, and vegetation heterogeneity during primary succession on the foreland of Coleman Glacier, in Washington State, USA. Community composition changed rapidly with high turnover between age classes. Cover increased through succession as expected. Species richness and diversity were highest in early succession at small scales and in late succession at larger scales. At small scales, heterogeneity decreased in early succession but increased in <b>mature</b> <b>sites.</b> At larger scales, heterogeneity reached its lowest point earlier in succession. These scale-dependent patterns in diversity and heterogeneity differ from results of other studies of glacier forelands.

40|$|Although gall {{diversity}} in the Neotropical region is immense, comparative studies on the phenology of host plants and their galls are scarce. Gall systems generally require high levels of phenological synchrony between the associated organisms. The relationships between the phenology of two leaf galls induced by an unidentified Cecidomyiidae in Aspidosperma spruceanum Benth. ex Müell. Arg. and by Pseudophacopteron sp. in A. australe Müell. Arg. were investigated. The investigation was performed on ten individuals per species in 15 -day intervals taking into consideration the percentage of galled leaves. In a one-year study, three distinct phenophases for the leaf galls and four phenophases for host plants were observed. The maximum percentage of leaf galls (80 %) on A. australe occurred just after the peak of leaf sprouting. In A. spruceanum, the percentage of leaf galls was always over 50 %, which {{can be related to}} continuous leaf production and gall induction in this species.

40|$|Recent CO 2 flux {{measurements}} from {{towers and}} aircraft (net ecosystem exchange by eddy covariance) and remote sens-ing/modeling (net primary productivity—NPP) following fire {{show that the}} regenerating boreal forest in western Canada has a low initial flux that increases with time since fire. Daytime CO 2 fluxes are downward, even after 2 years following fire, although fluxes were upward {{during the first year}} after the fire. In summer, the forest is a net carbon sink a few years following fire. A regression of all data gives a relationship where the CO 2 flux relative to 10 years following fire = 0. 11 + 0. 92 log 10 (years since fire) (r 2 = 0. 5). The CO 2 flux reaches the same rate as that of a <b>mature</b> <b>site</b> between 10 and 30 years following fire, depending on the site and the data set. Many studies in the literature indicate that soil respiration decreases following fire, although several models assume that heterotrophic respiration increases.

40|$|Abstract: Biomass and {{productivity}} in some tropical dry deciduous disturbed teak (Tectona grandis) forests of Satpura plateau were estimated in three communities identified as Tectona grandis – Lagerstroemia parviflora–Sterculia urens (site I); T. grandis–Lannea coromandalica–Diospyros melanoxylon–Butea monosperma (site II); T. grandis–Chloroxylon swietenia–L. parviflora–D. melanoxylon (site III) {{and a young}} plantation of T. grandis (site IV). Disturbance magnitude was determined by estimating density–diameter relationship and site quality parameters viz. soil nutrients and stand density. Site I and III (also IV) were most and least disturbed sites, respectively. Height and biomass, and gbh and biomass showed exponential relationships, thus can used for the estimation of biomass of the region. Trees contributed maximum towards total biomass followed by herbs and shrubs. <b>Mature</b> <b>sites</b> showed higher biomass than the younger sites. Photosynthetic:non–photosynthetic ratio was higher for younger and less disturbed sites and {{can be attributed to}} their higher photosynthetic demand at early developmental stages and protection of foliage by less disturbances from lopping and grazing. Younger stands showed higher values for root:shoot ratios. Invariably, the NPPtree and NPPtotal were higher for mature stands (reflection of the lesser tree density and higher mean basal area). NPPtree and NPPtotal under present study were lower than in other tropical dry forests. This may be the reflection of disturbance on the forests, lower soil depth and poor soil quality. NPPtea...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine ABC success {{determinants}} in <b>mature</b> ABC <b>sites.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The study surveys 65 users of an ABC system in service and manufacturing firms. Findings - The stepwise regression results indicate that top management support is the key determinant of ABC success in mature ABC firms. Other determinants examined were resource adequacy, education, performance improvement and reward link, competition intensity. Research limitations/implications - Past research has shown that top management support is critical in the early stages of ABC adoption and if withdrawn is a major cause of ABC implementation failure. Despite the technical benefits of ABC adoption the extent of change, the resource commitment and the management of conflict and power means that careful consideration of the determinants of success is crucial. Many researchers have examined this at initial implementation or have confounded their results by not distinguishing the stage of adoption. Very few have researched beyond the initial implementation to examine what factors continue to ensure ABC success once fully integrated. Practical implications - Practically any ABC adoption needs to secure top management support from inception through to routinisation and integration. Originality/value - The novelty of this study is in the way ABC success is measured, that participants were users of the ABC system and that the sites examined are only <b>mature</b> adoption <b>sites.</b> By examining only 'mature' ABC sites the differences in the stages of implementation are not confounded in the results. ...|$|R

Though endemic to the Tropics, no reports were found describing brown root rot disease in native forests, exclusively. Incidence, distribution, and host range of P. noxius were measured in {{primary and secondary}} rain forests on Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Phellinus noxius was recorded in 19 of 20 strip transects and 1. 2 -ha established plots and in all vegetation types, infecting 37 tree species in 30 genera and 22 families. Species most affected were Myristica Jatua, Dysoxylum samoense, and Hibiscus tiliaceus- 25, 16, and 10 %, respectively. Of 62 infection centers, 33 contained the same tree species and 13 were dominated by a single species. The fewest infections were recorded at primary montane and ridge top sites. Regenerating secondary valley sites had the highest incidence of disease and greatest number of infection centers. Infection centers at these disturbed sites also contained more trees on average than centers at primary sites. Disease incidence was influenced more by human disturbance than by vegetation type, topography, stem diameter, stem density, or soil type. The disturbed sites also appeared to lack the species richness of <b>mature</b> <b>sites.</b> This agrees with other host/pathogen associations, such as Douglas-fir/P. weirii and hardwood/Po noxius plantations, where disease incidence and spread was higher in species-poor than in species-rich stands...|$|R

We developed an allometric bark biomass model for naturally grown D. bholua in Baglung District in the mid-hills of Nepal. The model was based on data from 101 destructively sampled D. bholua on 20 sample plots representing different growth stages (regeneration, established, and <b>matured),</b> <b>site</b> qualities, and stand densities, and we used diameter and height–diameter ratio as predictors. Among 9 functions evaluated, a simple power function showed the best fit to the data. This model described most of the variations in bark biomass with no substantial trends in the residuals. Leave-one-out cross-validation also confirmed the high precision of this model, because it described most of the variations in bark biomass with no substantial trends in the prediction errors. The model can be applied for a precise prediction of bark biomass for individuals of D. bholua with diameters and height–diameter ratios similar to those used in this study. It is site-specific, and its application should therefore be limited to sites with growth stage, site quality, stand density, and species distribution similar to those that formed the basis of this study.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the ground-living spider {{communities}} of a commercial forest, using sites at various stages of the management cycle to represent different stages of succession. Clear-felling resulted in an increase in the abundance of large polyphagous cursorial hunters associated with open habitats, and a corresponding reduction in the numbers of small web-building litter species, with a more limited prey range, which characterised the later stages of succession. The most important factor in this change appeared to be the removal of the canopy, resulting in a modification of microclimatic conditions, and degradation of the litter layer. In the first nine years after clear-felling, there were clear and relatively rapid changes in community structure associated with successional age. The observed changes were considered to be mainly due to the increasing vegetation density in this period, which provided both particular structures and a more favourable microclimate for certain species. Associated changes were also found in species richness, abundance, diversity and eveness, which increased during this period. These attributes decreased into late succession, though the pattern was less clear for species abundance, and the oldest sites were less species rich, diverse and even than those of early succession. In late succession, the rate of community change slowed, the most <b>mature</b> <b>sites</b> being very similar in terms of their communities. In general, the differences that did exist were not related to the position of the site on the successional gradient. It was considered that these differences were not due to a single factor, but rather reflected the importance of different factors at each site...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Understanding the {{ecological}} effects of fire {{is important for}} biodiversity conservation in flammable ecosystems. To this end we quantified the winter and spring diet of silky mice (Pseudomys apodemoides) and heath rats (P. shortridgei) at 20 woodland sites ranging from 2 to 55 years post-fire. We tested the hypothesis that diets would differ (shift) between very recently burnt (2 – 3 years old) and mature ($ 17 years old) parts of the landscape. Analyses based on faecal material collected inwinter (June) and spring (October) demonstrated that both species ate {{a broad range of}} foods, but the diets of silky mice and heath rats differed substantially with respect to monocot, seed and invertebrates. Seasonal changes in diet were also observed. Silky mice demonstrated a distinct diet shift, with fewer flowers and more seeds consumed at very recently burnt sites comparedwithmature sites. A distinct diet shift was not observed for heath rats as they ate substantial quantities of monocots and forbs regardless of time since fire. However, they did demonstrate a seasonally dependent diet shift with respect to flowers: inwinter, more flowerswere eaten at very recently burnt sites but in spring more flowers were eaten at <b>mature</b> <b>sites.</b> In line with the diet shift hypothesis, silky mice altered their diet to take advantage of food groups (principally seeds) more readily available shortly after fire. Heath rats did not shift their diet to the same degree, but a focus on food groups (such as monocots and forbs) that are accessible across the time-since-fire spectrum may facilitate rapid post-fire recolonisation by this species...|$|R

We compared bee use of native and exotic plants in two types of restored native plant hedgerows: mature hedgerows (> 10 years from establishment) designed for natural enemy enhancement and new hedgerows (≤ 2 years from establishment) designed to enhance bee populations. Bees were collected from flowers using timed aerial netting and flowering plant cover was estimated by species using cover classes. At <b>mature</b> hedgerow <b>sites,</b> wild bee abundance, richness, and diversity were greater on native plants than exotic plants. At new sites, where native plants were small and had limited floral display, abundance of bees was greater on native plants than exotic plants; but, controlling for floral cover, {{there was no difference in}} bee diversity and richness between the two plant types. At both mature and new hedgerows, wild bees preferred to forage from native plants than exotic plants. Honey bees, which were from managed colonies, also preferred native plants at <b>mature</b> hedgerow <b>sites</b> but exhibited no preference at new sites. Our study shows that wild bees, and managed bees in some cases, prefer to forage on native plants in hedgerows over co-occurring weedy, exotic plants. Semi-quantitative ranking identified which native plants were most preferred. Hedgerow restoration with native plants may help enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, and maintain honey bee health, in agricultural areas. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration...|$|R
40|$|Formation and {{development}} of a river network in the permafrost zone is heavily influenced by icings and icing processes. It is of the most widespread occurrence in regions of discontinuous and continuous permafrost where the mean thickness of the ice on rivers varies over the range 1 − 2. 5 m, {{and most of the}} ice cover is formed by consecutive freezing of outcropping groundwater. The intensity of cryogenic channel formation in the permafrost zone has a clearly pronounced cyclic character that depends on the exceeding of the icing ice over the water edge of the river during the autumn low-water period. Five stages of cryogenic channel genesis are described: preglacial, transgressive, stabilizing, regressive, and postglacial. To each stage there corresponds a definite glaciohydrological regime of the discharge channels, their shape, size, and spatial distribution. The channel network is in its maximum development during the third and fourth states when the channel of the allochthonous flow divides into a number of shallow branches producing a complicated plan pattern of the terrain. <b>Mature</b> <b>sites</b> of annual appearance of icings clearly show areas that are in different development stages, which bears witness to a broad range of variability in the channel icing genesis across space and time. According to the size of icings, the flow of the river and geologo-geomorphological and cryogenic-hydrological conditions, five kinds of icing structure of the channel network have been identified: fan-shaped, cone-shaped, treelike, reticular, and longitudinal-insular. The channel icing network is a characteristic indicator of the specific character of development of glaciohydrosystems in the permafrost zone. </span...|$|R

Though endemic to the tropics, we found no re-ports describing brown root rot disease in native forests, exclusively. Incidence, distribution and host range of P. noxius were measured in pri-mary and secondary rainforests on Tutuila Island, American Samoa. P. noxius was recorded in 19 of 20 strip transects and 1. 2 ha established plots and in all vegetation types, infecting 37 tree spe-cies in 30 genera and 22 families. Species most affected were Myristica fatua, Dysoxylum samoense and Hibiscus tiliaceus 25, 16 and 10 percent, respectively. Of 62 infection centers, 33 contained the same tree species and 13 were dominated by a single species. The fewest in-fections were recorded at primary montane and ridge top sites, the most in secondary valleys. Disease incidence was influenced more by hu-man disturbance than by vegetation type, topog-raphy, stem diameter, stem density, or soil type. Regenerating secondary valley sites appeared to lack the species richness of <b>mature</b> <b>sites,</b> had the highest disease incidence, and the largest and highest number of infection centers. This agrees with other host/pathogen associations, such as Douglas-fir/P. weirii and hardwood/P. noxius plantations, where disease incidence and spread was higher in species poor than in species rich stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersal}} of algae and cyanobacteria at three Antarctic fellfield sites was investigated using microscopic and culture {{analysis of samples}} from active and passive air samplers Intersite variation in {{the mean number of}} large algal propagules (> 5 μm diameter) sampled was dependent on the niche space available for algal growth {{and the degree to which}} soil was exposed to desiccating influences, these factors could be related to the degree of maturity of the sue The numbers of large algal propagules were lowest at sites from which permanent snow cover had recently disappeared and highest at sites with developed soil circles but poorly developed moss and lichen flora <b>Mature</b> <b>sites</b> with diverse and developed moss and lichen flora produced intermediate numbers of algal propagules Propagules of multicellular algae, cyanobacteria and large-celled unicellular algae were found in the air at the end of the growing season of the respective algal groups as the soil surface dried This was the case for Prasiola crispa, Pmnularia borealis, snow algae and filamentous chlorophytes and cyanobacteria Dispersal of unicellular chlorophytes was greatest during the summer period and at sites with developed secondary flora, but also occurred at other sites and in association with small thaw events during winter Cultures were obtained from samples collected whilst an air mass that had originated in South America, deposited material on Signy Island This suggests that algal propagules have the ability to survive long-distance transport and potentially provide mocula for colonization of Antarctica as regional warming continues to expose fresh habitat...|$|R
