40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the psychological effect of working mothers upon children living in joint and nuclear family structures of Pakistan. After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that (1) Children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure will have more psychological problems as compared to the children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. (2) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure. (3) Children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure. (4) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure. (5) Children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. (6) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. On hypothesis 1, 3 and 5 the difference will be evident on the variables of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problems, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment Sample of the present research consisted of 256 Adolescent children of the working and non working mothers, including 64 children of working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of non working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female), and 64 children of non working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female). Their age range was from 12 years to 18 years. Subjects were interviewed & then SPM, WRAT-R & RASSI were administered according to standard procedure test was calculated {{in order to determine the}} difference of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problem, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment between the Adolescent children of working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Pearson Product Moment Coefficient Correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between the intellectual capacity and academic achievement of Adolescent children of working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Further z-test was calculated to determine the significant difference between correlations of above mentioned groups. The results showed significant differences between adolescent children of employed mothers of two family structures (Joint and nuclear) on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems, Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment. There was a significant difference on the variables of Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment and insignificant differences on other two variables i. e. of Antisocial behavior and Anger control problems, between adolescents children of working and Non-working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structures. There was also significant differences on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems and Adjustment and insignificant differences on the variables of, Emotional distress and Positive self between adolescent children of working and Non- working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structures. Further the correlation of intellectual capacity and academic achievement was more positive (i) for children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure. (ii) for children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure as compared to children of non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> joint family structure and (iii) for children of working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children of non working <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> nuclear family structure.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} child-rearing {{practices}} in Chinese families in Beijing and Hong Kong. The sample consisted of 89 <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Beijing and 45 <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong. The mothers were instructed {{to respond to the}} Child-rearing Practice Report (CRPR) in Q-sort format. Some of the item clusters were combined to produce the authoritarian and authoritative disciplinary styles. The results indicated that <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong were more likely to adopt an authoritarian child-rearing pattern than <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Beijing; however, the two groups did not differ in authoritative child-rearing style. The results also showed that <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong controlled their children more than their counterparts in Beijing, and they were less inclined to show affection towards their children; <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Beijing emphasized their children's achievement much more than their Hong Kong counterparts. The findings suggest that Chinese parental disciplinary styles may be quite different in various regions of Chinese societies.

In families with an alcoholic parent, adolescents and their mothers rated family members as less anxious than did adolescents and <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> families without a drinking problem. Also <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> the alcoholic families rated family members as being more involved, and their ratings were higher than <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> other families.
