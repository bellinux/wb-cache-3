5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made {{at his or her}} instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E

One, or both, of these fields <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.|$|E

25|$|In the Baden region, Badisch Rotgold is a {{specialty}} rosé made from Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) and Ruländer (Pinot gris). Under German wine law the wine <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> at least QbA level (meaning the grapes must be harvested with a ripeness level {{of at least}} 51°Oe to 72°Oe. A specialty of the Rems Valley in nearby Württemberg region is a style of wine known as Schillerwein. Produced {{in the area for}} over 300 years, Schillerwein is made from pressing and co-fermenting red and white grape varieties together. While not always a rosé, the color of Schillerwein range from dark red to pale pink depending on the grape varieties and percentage of each used in the blend.|$|E
25|$|An {{influential}} standard textbook is Animal Signals, by John Maynard Smith and David Harper. These authors {{divide the}} costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin— some investment <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.|$|E
25|$|Production forging {{involves}} significant {{capital expenditure}} for machinery, tooling, facilities and personnel. In {{the case of}} hot forging, a high-temperature furnace (sometimes {{referred to as the}} forge) is required to heat ingots or billets. Owing {{to the size of the}} massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce, as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal, a special building is frequently required to house the operation. In the case of drop forging operations, provisions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> absorb the shock and vibration generated by the hammer. Most forging operations use metal-forming dies, which must be precisely machined and carefully heat-treated to correctly shape the workpiece, as well as to withstand the tremendous forces involved.|$|E

25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 115 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with U.S. Highway 62 (a freeway at this point) near Cache. It goes due north from here, {{passing through a}} remote part of Fort Sill before reaching the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. After entering the refuge, SH-115 is unsigned, appearing only as a nameless road. The road intersects State Highway 49 at the Cache Wye. Northbound motorists that continue straight at the intersection will be put on westbound SH-49; a right turn <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> continue on northbound SH-115. SH-49 also turns at the Cache Wye, forming an effective concurrency with SH-49 (though neither highway has any signage). The two highways turn northeast, then curve back around to the east. SH-115 then splits off to the north, while SH-49 continues a general eastbound heading. SH-115 passes just east of Mt. Roosevelt and Mt. Sheridan before exiting the refuge, whereupon it regains its usual state highway signage.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E
500|$|Wood (2006) has {{maintained}} that Adams' political philosophy had become irrelevant {{by the time}} the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by {{more than a decade of}} vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Yet Wood ignored Adams' peculiar definition of the term [...] "republic," [...] and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. He also underestimated Adams' belief in checks and balances, such as Adams' statement that, [...] "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest." [...] This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's famous statement that, [...] "mbition <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> counteract ambition", in The Federalist No. 51, explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution. Adams was unsurpassed in his dedication to establishing checks and balances as a governing strategem.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea behind}} {{radiocarbon}} dating is straightforward, but {{years of work}} were required to develop the technique {{to the point where}} accurate dates could be obtained. Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, {{in the form of a}} calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> account for the proportion of [...] in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of [...] throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects). [...] Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its [...] to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.|$|E
