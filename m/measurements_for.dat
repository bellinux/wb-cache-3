5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> {{stars were}} obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E

The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> Kronan were {{recorded}} in contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included.

The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E

The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0g (1.62oz) and had testes 11mm (0.43in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128mm (5.0in), tail length of 150mm (5.9in), hindfoot length of 31mm (1.2in), and ear length of 19mm (0.75in).|$|E
5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne <b>Measurements)</b> <b>for</b> the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He {{developed}} microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.|$|E
