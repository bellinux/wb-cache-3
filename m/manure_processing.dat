40|$|Liquid {{animal manure}} and its {{management}} contributes to environmental problems such as, global warming, acidification, and eutrophication. To address these {{environmental issues and}} their related costs <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> technologies were developed. The objective here {{was to assess the}} environmental consequences of a new <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> technology that separates manure into a solid and liquid fraction and de-waters the liquid fraction by means of reverse osmosis. This results in a liquid mineral concentrate used as mineral nitrogen and potassium fertilizer and a solid fraction used for bio-energy production or as phosphorus fertilizer. Five environmental impact categories were quantified using life cycle assessment: climate change (CC), terrestrial acidification (TA), marine eutrophication (ME), particulate matter formation (PMF), and fossil fuel depletion (FFD). For pig as well as dairy cattle manure, we compared a scenario with the processing method and a scenario with additional anaerobic digestion of the solid fraction to a reference situation applying only liquid manure. Comparisons were based on a functional unit of 1 ton liquid manure. System boundaries were set from the manure storage under the animal house to the field application of all end products. Scenarios with only <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> increased the environmental impact for most impact categories compared to the reference: ME did not change, whereas, TA and PMF increased up to 44 % as a result of NH 3 and NOx emissions from processing and storage of solid fraction. Including digestion reduced CC by 117 % for pig manure and 104 % for dairy cattle manure, mainly because of substituted electricity and avoided N 2 O emission from storage of solid fraction. FFD decreased by 59 % for pig manure and increased 19 % for dairy cattle manure. TA and PMF remained higher compared to the reference. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH 4 emission from manure storage, NH 3 emission from processing, and the replaced nitrogen fertilizer by the mineral concentrate were important parameters affecting final results. It was concluded that processing fattening pig and dairy cattle manure to produce mineral fertilizer increased overall environmental consequences in terms of CC (except for dairy cattle manure), TA, PMF, and FFD compared to current agricultural practice. Adding the production of bio-energy reduced CC and FFD. Only when NH 3 emission from processing was low and bio-energy was produced, overall equal or better environmental performance was obtained for TA and PMF. It was emphasized that real time measurements should be done to enhance the environmental assessment of <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> technologies. Results of this study present the full environmental consequences of <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> and key parameters affecting the environmental impact of manure management.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the factors}} underlying {{the probability that}} Dutch pig farmers have plans to (a) stop, (b) to increase farm size and/or (re) build a barn, (c) {{to improve the quality}} of the production process and (d) to make <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> facility at the own farm. A computer-based questionnaire was carried out among pig farmers in 1999 and 2000. Farmer plans were analysed using a multivariate probit model. The results show that farm size and life cycle are important variables explaining the probability of farmers having plans. Furthermore, risk averse farmers more frequently have plans {{to improve the quality of}} the production process, whereas farmers with a negative attitude towards biological farming search for opportunities to make a <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> facility at their own farm. Results also reveal that most plans are significantly correlated and that the explanatory power of the model is relatively low, with the latter finding suggesting that more study is required to obtain a good understanding of strategic planning.

40|$|The {{abolition}} of the Dutch milk quota system {{has been accompanied by}} the introduction of a new manure policy to limit phosphate production (i. e., excretion via manure) on expanding dairy farms. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of these recent policy changes on the farm structure, management, labor income, nitrogen and phosphate surpluses, and greenhouse gas emissions of an average Dutch dairy farm. The new manure policy requires that any increase in phosphate production be partly processed and partly applied to additional farmland. In addition, phosphate quotas have been introduced. Herein, we used a whole-farm optimization model to simulate an average farm before and after quota abolition and introduction of the new manure policy. The objective function of the model maximized labor income. We combined the model with a farm nutrient balance and life-cycle assessment to determine environmental impact. Based on current prices, increasing the number of cows after quota abolition was profitable until <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> or additional land was required to comply with the new manure policy. <b>Manure</b> <b>processing</b> involved treatment so that phosphate was removed from the national manure market. Farm intensity in terms of milk per hectare increased by about 4 %, from 13, 578 kg before quota abolition to 14, 130 kg after quota abolition. Labor income increased by 505 /yr. When costs of <b>manure</b> <b>processing</b> decreased from 13 to 8 /t of manure or land costs decreased from 1, 187 to 573 /ha, farm intensity could increase up to 20 % until the phosphate quota became limiting. Farms that had already increased their barn capacity to prepare for expansion after milk quota abolition could benefit from purchasing extra phosphate quota to use their full barn capacity. If milk prices increased from 355 to 420 /t, farms could grow unlimited, provided that the availability of external inputs such as labor, land, barn capacity, feed, and phosphate quota at current prices were also unlimited. The milk quota abolition, accompanied by a new manure policy, will slightly increase nutrient losses per hectare, due to an increase in farm intensity. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of milk will hardly change, so at a given milk production per cow, total greenhouse gas emissions will increase linearly with an increase in the number of cows. </p...|$|E

This results in important anthropogenic emissions to the environment, but also a large potential for the recovery and reuse of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from waste streams. In this study, a substance flow analysis study for N and P is presented, in which the anthropogenic fluxes, stocks and hot spots of these two nutrients are quantified throughout the Flemish economy and environment. The environmental impact of the different economic sectors is addressed through {{the determination of the}} N and P footprint.

Although preventive measures at these RRPs can minimize enteric pathogen risk, zero risk can never be obtained for raw ready-to-eat vegetables. Good food hygiene practices at home are essential to reduce the incidence of food-borne illnesses...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transition}} from a fossil to a bio-based economy, it has become an important challenge to maximally recuperate and recycle valuable nutrients coming from <b>manure</b> and digestate <b>processing.</b> Membrane filtration is a suitable technology to separate valuable nutrients in easily transportable concentrates which could potentially be re-used as green fertilizers, in the meantime producing high quality water. However, traditional membrane filtration systems often suffer technical problems in waste stream treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of vibratory shear enhanced processing (VSEP) in the removal of macronutrients (N, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg) from the liquid fraction of digestates, reducing their concentrations down to dischargeable/re-usable water. In addition, the re-use potential of VSEP-concentrates as sustainable substitutes for fossil-based mineral fertilizers was evaluated. Removal efficiencies for N and P by two VSEP filtration steps were high, though not sufficient to continuously reach the Flemish legislation criteria for discharge into surface waters (15 mg N l(- 1) and 2 mg P l(- 1)). Additional purification can occur in a subsequent lagoon, yet further optimization of the VSEP filtration system is advised. Furthermore, concentrates produced by one membrane filtration step showed potential as N-K fertilizer with an economic value of a,not sign 6. 3 +/- 1. 1 t(- 1) fresh weight (FW). Further research is, however, required to evaluate the impact on crop production and soil quality by application of these new potential green fertilizers...|$|R
