5|$|After {{reading a}} tract, Why Are The <b>Many</b> <b>Poor?,</b> {{issued by the}} {{recently}} formed Fabian Society, Shaw went to the society's next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884. He became a member in September, and before the year's end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant, a fine orator.|$|E
5|$|Eva {{was well}} {{received}} in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Capilla Real de Granada. Francoist Spain had not {{recovered from the}} Spanish Civil War (the autarkic economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-peseta notes to <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> children she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the Order of Isabella the Catholic.|$|E
5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> {{women and}} men whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
50|$|The Norman élite and churchmen spoke Norman French and Latin. <b>Many</b> <b>poorer</b> {{settlers}} spoke English, Welsh and Flemish. The Gaelic areas spoke Irish dialects. The Yola {{language of}} County Wexford was {{a survivor of}} the early English dialects.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to religion, {{the economy was}} also a motivator in the association's foundation. The Highland Clearances, crop failures, and population pressures in industrialised urban centres all created conditions that, by the mid-nineteenth century, made emigration seem attractive to <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> Scots.|$|R
50|$|This has changed; white flight has reversed, as Yuppies and upper-middle-class, empty nest Baby Boomers {{return to}} urban living, usually in condominiums, {{such as in}} New York City's Lower East Side, Chicago's South Loop and Miami's Brickell Neighborhood. The result has been the {{displacement}} of <b>many</b> <b>poorer,</b> inner-city residents.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the main}} reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of {{education}} include the fact that girls are needed to assist their mothers at home, have been raised to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation, have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children, have an economic dependency on men, and are sometimes subject to child-marriage. <b>Many</b> <b>poor</b> families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5000|$|The Corps of Engineers {{also participated}} in the Inter-American Geodetic Survey for mapping Central and South America. As part of this {{research}} <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> nations could develop their resources. [...] "In Cuba, for instance, an extensive water table survey by IAGS {{made it possible to}} develop 500 wells." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Many</b> <b>poorer</b> {{households}} {{in developing countries}} {{have no access to}} a toilet at all, leading to open defecation. Serious waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea occur when open defecation or poor sanitation results in human waste polluting water supplies. Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements.|$|R
50|$|John Townley {{began to}} visit the {{meetings}} in Manchester {{after he left the}} Church of England, then joined the Methodist Society. He was a relatively wealthy bricklayer. Around 1766, he was visited at his home by James Wardley. He subsequently joined the Wardley Group and hosted <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> members of the society.|$|R
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{legacies}} {{that the}} Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the jiedushi, who slowly came {{to challenge the}} power of the central government. After the An Lushan Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, Shandong, Hubei and Henan provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs. As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority. The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the Song dynasty was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. <b>Many</b> <b>poor</b> fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates. With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the Mongols.|$|E
25|$|Local populations {{admit that}} a large amount {{mahogany}} is leaving the reserve, but <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> sections of the economy see {{the high price of}} mahogany as enough incentive to clear away valuable ecosystems that provide irreplaceable services to the water and soil.

40|$|The {{problems}} of developing country dependence {{on a narrow}} range of commodity exports are well-established. <b>Many</b> <b>poorer</b> developing countries have continued to generate a substantial proportion of their total export revenues from one or {{a small number of}} basic food commodities.

5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Mississippi led the South in {{developing}} a disfranchising constitution, passing it in 1890. By raising barriers to voter registration, the state legislature disenfranchised most blacks and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites, excluding them from politics until the late 1960s. It established a one-party state dominated by white Democrats.|$|E
50|$|Using {{herbicides}} {{to manage}} L. camara is very effective but also expensive (prohibiting {{its use in}} <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> countries where L. camara is well established). The most effective way of chemically treating plant species is to first mow the area then spray the area with a herbicide (weed-killer), although this may have serious environmental consequences.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 Anny Bakalian, {{author of}} Armenian-Americans: From Being to Feeling Armenian, wrote that <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> Armenians, {{especially}} low income {{refugees from the}} former Soviet Union and the Middle East who arrived in the 1980s, {{had been forced to}} take an Armenian identity. He argued that <b>many</b> of the <b>poor</b> are not familiar with American customs and are uneducated, this therefore [...] "risks increasing prejudice and discrimination against group members." [...] Bakalian stated his belief that [...] "Los Angeles is not representative of Armenian-Americans or the Armenian-American community." ...|$|R

25|$|Despite Chávez's {{military}} failure, he {{was immediately}} catapulted {{into the national}} spotlight due to his action, with <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy. Afterward, Chávez imprisoned at the San Carlos military stockade. President Pérez was impeached a year later.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1920, Tennessee {{became the}} thirty-sixth and final state {{necessary}} {{to ratify the}} Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provided women the right to vote. Disfranchising voter registration requirements continued to keep most African Americans and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites, both men and women, off the voter rolls.|$|E

50|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century <b>many</b> <b>poorer</b> girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking.

25|$|With Phillips County {{developed}} for cotton plantations in the antebellum era, its population was overwhelmingly black and descended from slaves: in Phillips County, African-Americans outnumbered whites by a ten-to-one ratio.

He was buried in Brompton Cemetery in South West London.|$|E
25|$|Election campaigns {{were often}} {{accompanied}} by fraud and violence as Democrats tried to reduce black Republican voting. Finally, the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a new 1890 constitution, with barriers to voter registration and other measures that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and <b>many</b> <b>poor</b> whites for decades, subduing the Republican and Populist movements of the late 19th century.|$|E
