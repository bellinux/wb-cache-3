5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road.</b> On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road,</b> a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Warren Corners, {{the route}} heads across rural areas along the Cambria–Lockport town line. It soon enters the small hamlet of Hickory Corners, {{where the road}} passes under Lower <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> (CR902). Access to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur (CR114), a {{connector}} leading to Lower <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road.</b> NY93 continues southward along the town line, changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> (CR5) west {{of the city of}} Lockport. From here, the route crosses over CSX Transportation's Lockport Subdivision rail line at the hamlet of Lockport Junction before intersecting with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road) and NY270 (Campbell Boulevard) just south of the community. NY270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road, beginning a concurrency with NY31.|$|E
5|$|SR56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing Canyon Crest Academy {{before turning}} southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before {{intersecting}} Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby Westview High School. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SR56 curves back east, passing under Carmel <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and Rancho Peñasquitos Boulevard in Rancho Peñasquitos in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a diamond interchange with I-15. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as Ted Williams Parkway.|$|E

5|$|MD7 heads east through {{forest and}} {{scattered}} residential subdivisions through the northern fringe of Joppatowne, where the highway intersects Old <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and MD152 (<b>Mountain</b> <b>Road).</b> The route crosses Winters Run and intersects Edgewood Road and MD24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) in Edgewood. MD7 crosses Haha Branch and meets Abingdon Road at Abingdon, which {{is home to}} the Nelson-Reardon-Kennard House. The highway intersects MD136 (Calvary Road) in between crossings of Bynum Run and James Run, which flow into the Bush River. MD7 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway as it passes through the commercial area of Riverside, where the highway meets MD543 (Creswell Road) just south of that highway's interchange with I-95. The road passes through forest with isolated residential subdivisions, one of which is served by Holly Oak Circle, which meets MD7 at a roundabout.|$|E
5|$|SR 3 {{passes through}} the towns of Covington Mill, Trinity Center, and Wyntoon before {{paralleling}} the Trinity River and Trinity Mountains as Weaverville-Scott <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and crossing the Scott Mountains and the Pacific Crest Trail into Siskiyou County.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Although it began in Youngstown and ended in Newstead as it does today, the initial routing of NY93 deviated from the modern path {{in the vicinity of the}} city of Lockport. From Cambria to Lockport's eastern suburbs, the highway originally used NY425, Lower <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road,</b> Akron Road, and a series of streets in Lockport. NY93 was moved onto NY104 and Junction Road in Cambria in the 1940s, and altered to bypass Lockport to the south on a new highway and Robinson and Dysinger roads in 1991. In 2006, NY93 was realigned west of Lockport to continue south on Junction Road to NY31. The change removed NY93 from Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road,</b> a county-owned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|After {{intersecting}} SR163, {{also known}} as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21lanes wide. Eastbound SR56 and Carmel <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Lewiston, NY104 comes within view of the Niagara River gorge and begins to run along its eastern rim. NY104 meets the {{northern}}most point of NY61 at the northern campus of Niagara University. Past NY61, the route passes by the Niagara Power Visitors Center and over the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant. On {{the opposite side of the}} plant, NY104 connects with Interstate190 (I-190) at exit25 via Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and passes under the eastern approach to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, which links I-190 with Ontario's Highway405.|$|E
5|$|SR56 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route278, and was renumbered SR56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR56 to the north end of SR125 and {{continue}} east to SR67, but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{and trucks}} using direct air cooling (without an {{intermediate}} liquid) were built {{over a long}} period from the very beginning and ending with a small and generally unrecognized technical change. Before World War II, water-cooled cars and trucks routinely overheated while climbing <b>mountain</b> <b>roads,</b> creating geysers of boiling cooling water. This was considered normal, and at the time, most noted <b>mountain</b> <b>roads</b> had auto repair shops to minister to overheating engines.|$|R

5|$|Simultaneously {{with their}} {{appearance}} on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary <b>mountain</b> <b>road</b> to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it was confronted with a North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, {{it was able to}} disengage.|$|E
5|$|During his trek, Riki is {{attacked}} by a pack of dogs and falls into a river. Riki is rescued by his father, Shiro, who advises him {{about the importance of}} strength and leaves, not knowing Riki is his son. Influenced by Shiro, Riki aims to become strong and continually visits his mother. On a later trip, Riki sees a young boy, , hit by a truck on a <b>mountain</b> <b>road</b> and sent over the road railing. Riki howls for help, but instead attracts the dogs that had attacked him. Riki defends Daisuke until Shiro and his owner, , arrive. Shiro learns that Riki is his son. The book ends with Gohei and Shiro fighting the bear Akakabuto. A bullet becomes lodged in Akakabuto's brain, driving him insane. Riki watches as the bear grabs Shiro and they fall off a cliff.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road,</b> Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E

5|$|East of Jacobsville, MD 177 {{receives}} {{the eastern end}} of MD 100. There is no direct access from eastbound MD 100 to westbound MD 177. The state highway becomes a three-lane road with the center lane controlled by lane use signals. During rush hours, there are two lanes in the relevant direction; at all other times, the center lane serves as a center left turn lane. The eastern end of the three-lane section is at South Carolina Avenue in the community of Lake Shore. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road and passes a loop of Old <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road.</b> At Pinehurst Road, which leads to Downs Memorial Park, the route veers southeast toward Gibson Island. MD 177 reaches its eastern terminus at the gatehouse that guards the private island community {{on the north side of}} the mouth of the Magothy River at the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|In June1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition {{sued the}} San Diego City Council to {{require them to}} move the western {{terminus}} of SR56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August1, the City of San Diego received a petition {{in which more than}} 45,000people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena. The highway heads north as a four-lane freeway to a partial interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 10 to eastbound MD 100 or from westbound MD 100 to southbound MD 10. MD 10 and MD 100 briefly run concurrently northwest as an eight-lane freeway and diverge at another partial interchange; in both carriageways, traffic must move over two lanes {{to remain on}} the same route. Just north of the MD 100 split, MD 10 has a half-diamond interchange with MD 177 (<b>Mountain</b> <b>Road).</b> That interchange has ramps from southbound MD 10 to MD 177 and from MD 177 to northbound MD 10. Traffic from eastbound MD 100 to northbound MD 10 and from southbound MD 10 to westbound MD 100 uses MD 177 and MD 2 as intermediaries.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build <b>mountain</b> <b>roads</b> connecting communities together. The <b>mountain</b> <b>roads</b> had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|R
5|$|Not {{far from}} CR39, the route enters the hamlet of West Conesville, another small {{community}} built up around NY990V's junction with CR59 (Bull Hill Road). The road continues northeastward from West Conesville, serving {{a handful of}} scattered homes separated by stretches of woodland and open fields. This sparsely developed section along the northern bank of Manor Kill ultimately leads to the hamlet of Conesville, located at an intersection with CR18 (Bear Kill Road). NY990V ends at the junction, and its right-of-way continues east toward NY145 in Durham as CR3 (Potter <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road).</b> Reference routes in New York are typically not signed with touring route markers, as most are short connector roads or are known by other, more prominent names. NY990V, however, is fully signed as a touring route.|$|E
5|$|Now {{fully in}} the town of Lockport, NY31 and NY93 proceed {{northeast}} through an open area of the town as a four-lane divided highway. The two routes continue to {{the western edge of the}} city of Lockport, where they intersect with Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road</b> and the Lockport Bypass. The overlap ends here as NY93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass. Along the bypass, NY93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hinman Road (CR903) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal. Past the waterway, the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road (CR123) on the Lockport–Pendleton town line. The Lockport Bypass ends here, leaving NY93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road.|$|E
5|$|When NY270 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it began at Main Street (NY5) in the hamlet of Eggertsville and followed Eggert Road north to Millersport Highway. Here, it turned to the northeast, utilizing what is now NY263 to the modern campus of SUNY Buffalo. While today's Millersport Highway veers east to bypass the college, the highway originally went straight through the grounds, partially by way of what is now St. Rita's Lane. North of Ellicott Creek, NY270 proceeded to Getzville via North Forest and Stahl Roads. At Getzville, NY270 joined its modern alignment and followed it to Saunders Settlement Road (now NY31), where it turned northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road for a short distance to Upper <b>Mountain</b> <b>Road,</b> where it ended at NY3 outside of Lockport.|$|E
