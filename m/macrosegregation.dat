The distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced <b>macrosegregation</b> with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at the billet centre to 1.92 at the billet periphery. These <b>macrosegregation</b> patterns were explained in terms of inverse segregation in which solute rich liquid from the billet centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed solidification shrinkage at the billet periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from the billet rotation.|$|E

Better understanding of the physical characteristics of <b>macrosegregation</b> through numerical simulation could significantly contribute to the segregation control. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to predict <b>macrosegregation</b> in continuously cast billets with a newly developed three-dimensional <b>macrosegregation</b> model. The fluid flow, solidification, and solute transport in the entire billet region were solved and analyzed. Flow patterns, revealing a typical melt recirculation at the upper region of mold and thermosolutal convection at the secondary cooling zone, significantly affect the solidification and solute distribution. The solute redistribution occurring with thermosolutal convection at the solidification front contributes significantly to continued <b>macrosegregation</b> as solidification proceeds. The results of this study show that the equilibrium partition coefficient is mostly responsible for the magnitude of <b>macrosegregation,</b> while comparison between solute P and S indicated that diffusion coefficients also have some amount of influence.

Besides sedimen-tation and flotation of equiaxed grains, feeding flow, ther-mal and solutal buoyancy driven flow, and inlet flow are potential convection mechanisms which cause the for-mation of <b>macrosegregations.</b> Since <b>macrosegregations</b> are formed during solidification processes where relative motion between melt and solidifying dendrites occurs, their formation {{is strongly dependent on}} the flow, espe-cially in the mushy zone. To study and compare the im-pact of the different flow phenomena, a numerical inves-tigation has been carried out. The presented study dis-cusses the impact of different convection types like inlet flow, thermal and solutal buoyancy flow, and feeding flow on the formation of <b>macrosegregations</b> for one highly and one low permeable mushy zone. It is shown that low mush permeability favors positive <b>macrosegregations</b> ad-jacent to the wall and strong negative segregations at the center line.

Experimental {{results indicated that the}} magnetic field caused the channel and freckle <b>macrosegregations</b> during directional solidification. Comparison of the microstructures in unmodified and Sr-modified Al- 7 wtpctSi alloys showed that the Sr-addition enhanced the convection effects. Moreover, the EBSD analysis revealed that the magnetic field changed the alignment of the alpha-Al dendrite and modified the distribution of dendrite fragments in both unmodified and Sr-modified Al- 7 wtpctSi alloys. Indeed, the application of the magnetic field caused the -crystal direction of the alpha-Al dendrite to deflect from the solidification direction and induced the formation of dendrite fragments {{on one side of the}} sample. Further, the Seebeck signal (E-S) at the liquid/solid interface was measured in situ during directional solidification of Al- 7 wtpct Si alloy and the results indicated that the value of the E-S was of the order of 10 mu V and decreased with the increase of the growth speed. The above results may be attributed to the thermoelectric magnetic convection and its effect on the distribution of the solute Si.

40|$|The {{continuous}} casting {{process is a}} widely used technique in modern steel plants. However, it is a complicated process that is not well understood. The objective {{of this research is}} to model the porosity and <b>macrosegregation</b> due to shrinkage related effects and solid deformation in the {{continuous casting}} of steel. Solid phase movements due to bulging and variable roll gap are modeled with a simple algebraic equation based on assumed slab surface deflection. A simplified single domain fluid flow model is derived to predict the pressure field. When liquid pressure drops to zero, porosity starts to form. The distribution of porosity is calculated using the porosity equation which is based on the mass conservation. A <b>macrosegregation</b> model based on the species conservation is derived. With the relative velocity calculated from the pressure results and the solid velocity, <b>macrosegregation</b> is obtained. Since the solid phase velocity is not zero and mixture density is not assumed to be constant, porosity and <b>macrosegregation</b> due to both solid deformation and shrinkage effects are incorporated. In order to validate the model, the pressure field of a three-dimensional pure metal solidification system is simulated.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Macrosegregation</b> {{occurs in}} casting the most case is {{as a result}} of slow {{interdendritic}} flow due to shrinkage geometry, solid deformation or gravity. In some cases could be the result of solid movement {{in the early stages of}} solidification[1]. The problem is that the observation of <b>macrosegregation</b> in steel material is not easy because of high temperature condition. This recent work uses low melting temperature material alloy to simulate the actual condition as a model material. Various efforts to prevent <b>macrosegregation</b> are aimed to control liquid flow and movement of solid, one of them is by cooling rate controling. In this experiment the mold is cooled in three types of cooling medias to represent three different cooling conditions in order to observe the influence of cooling rate on <b>macrosegregation</b> during solidification of the alloy. The outer part close to the mold wall and the bottom of casting contains less solute than inner location. This occurs in all cooling conditions but cooling rate can cause the solute in casting distributed differently. At high cooling rate condition, distribution of Bi rich grain is more uniform.

40|$|Abstract. Microsegregation gets {{eliminated}} significantly if subsequent {{hot working}} and/or annealing are done on cast products. <b>Macrosegregation</b> however persists, causing problems in quality, and hence, {{has to be}} attended to. Microsegregation {{is a consequence of}} rejection of solutes by the solid into the interdendritic liquid. Scheil’s quation is mostly employed. However, other equations have been proposed, which take into account diffusion in solid phase and/or incomplete mixing in liquid. <b>Macrosegregation</b> results from movements of microsegregated regions over macroscopic distances due to motion of liquid and free crystals. Motion of impure interdendritic liquid causes regions of positive <b>macrosegregation,</b> whereas purer solid crystals yield negative <b>macrosegregation.</b> Flow of interdendritic liquid is primarily natural convection due to thermal and solutal buoyancy, and partly forced convection due to suction by shrinkage cavity formation etc. The present paper briefly deals with fundamentals of the above and contains some recent studies as well. Experimental investigations in molten alloys do not allow visualization of the complex flow pattern as well as other phenomena, such as dendrite-tip detachment. Experiments with room temperature analogues, and mathematical modelling have supplemented these efforts. However, the complexity of the phenomena demands simplifying assumptions.

One such defect is the redistribution (or, <b>macrosegregation)</b> of the various alloying components during the freezing of an off-eutectic mixture. In general, alloy components freeze at different rates and over a temperature range, establishing thermal and solutal gradients which cause fluid motion and consequent <b>macrosegregation.</b> While recent modelling efforts have enjoyed a measure of success, most of these efforts have been confined to binary alloys. The study of two component mixtures is an excellent starting place, where one can examine a simple, well-defined system and more easily discern the basic transport phenomena involved in alloy solidification. However, most commercially interesting alloys contain more than two components. ^ A continuum mixture model for the transport of mass, momentum, enthalpy and species has been extended to include a third component in a metal alloy. A generic method has been developed for using the ternary phase diagram to calculate local temperature, phase fractions and phase compositions, which are needed to close the model.

40|$|AbstractA 5 -phase mixed columnar-equiaxed {{solidification}} {{model was}} recently introduced {{to predict the}} as-cast structure, {{and a series of}} laboratory experiments were performed previously to verify the model. The focus of the current work is to analyze the formation of <b>macrosegregation,</b> which accompanies the formation of the as-cast structure including the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). The as-cast structure and <b>macrosegregation</b> map of a cylindrical Al- 4 wt. % Cu ingot poured at 800 °C are used as a reference to validate the calculations. Good agreement between the calculations and the experiment regarding both the <b>macrosegregation</b> and CET is achieved. Thermal-solutal convection and equiaxed crystal sedimentation in such ingot are verified to be key mechanisms governing the formation of <b>macrosegregation.</b> The competitive equiaxed/columnar growth, the soft and hard blocking mechanisms predominate the CET. The numerical study of grid sensitivity indicates that the global segregation pattern and CET are not significantly affected by grid size; however, some fine details of the segregation map which are predicted by fine grid (~ 0. 5 mm) are smeared or locally averaged by the coarse grid (~ 2 mm). Such details were also not resolved in the measurement. Future investigations are demanding...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} entire casting process starting from the mould filling stage to complete solidification is presented. The model takes into consideration any phase change taking place during the filling process. A volume of fluid method is used for tracking the metal–air interface during filling and an enthalpy based macro-scale solidification model {{is used for the}} phase change process. The model is demonstrated for the case of filling and solidification of Pb– 15 wt%Sn alloy in a side-cooled two-dimensional rectangular cavity, and the resulting evolution of a mushy region and <b>macrosegregation</b> are studied. The effects of process parameters related to filling, namely degree of melt superheat and filling velocity on <b>macrosegregation</b> in the cavity, are also investigated. Results show significant differences in the progress of the mushy zone and <b>macrosegregation</b> pattern between this analysis and conventional analysis without the filling effect...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} improve the {{prediction}} accuracy of <b>macrosegregation</b> channel, an algorithm for dynamic remeshing is proposed. The basic idea is to generate fine elements near the liquidus isotherm. The norm of the gradient of solid fraction is used for piloting the remeshing in the mushy zone; whereas, the objective mesh size in the liquid is considered {{as a function of}} the distance to the liquidus isotherm. The efficiency of mesh adaptation is demonstrated by prediction of <b>macrosegregation</b> channel in a case of unidirectional solidification...|$|E
