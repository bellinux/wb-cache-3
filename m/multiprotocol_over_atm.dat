40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} design of a {{value-added}} ATM switch that is capable of performing packet-level (IP) filtering at the maximum throughput of 2. 88 Gbit/s per port. This firewall switch nicely integrates the IP level security mechanisms into the hardware components of an ATM switch so that most of the filtering operations are performed in parallel with the normal cell processing, and most of its cost is absorbed into the base cost of the switch. The firewall switch employs the concept of “last cell hostage ” (LCH) to avoid or reduce the latency caused by filtering. We analyze in detail the performance of the firewall switch in terms of the throughput and the latency and address related design issues. Applications of our firewall switch as Internet and intranet security solutions are also discussed.

40|$|Concepts {{permitting}} further {{utilization of}} existing networks and protocols {{as well as}} taking advantage of new ATM features within the ATM environment are crucial for the deployment of ATM in local area networks. By now two methods gained practical significance in integrating ATM networks into traditional LAN environments: Classical IP over ATM of IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and LAN Emulation of the ATM Forum. In this work both approaches are described and analyzed, and the restrictions they still encounter are considered. Proposed advancements as well as future concepts prepared by the IETF and the ATM Forum are presented, especially the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) and <b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>Over</b> <b>ATM</b> (MPOA).

40|$|<b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>over</b> <b>ATM</b> (MPOA), IP {{switching}} and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) have {{distinctly different}} mechanisms for cut-through packet forwarding. MPOA and IP switching use flow-based cut-through (FBC) forwarding while MPLS uses routing table linked cut-through forwarding (TLC). This paper examines {{the sensitivity of}} each these cut-through forwarding mechanisms to changes in underlying routing tables. We examine a scenario where a congestion-sensitive dynamic routing protocol, such as OSPF optimised multipath, leads to frequently changing routing tables. We show that FBC forwarding reacts significantly worse than flow length distributions predict, taking up to 1200 seconds to react to route changes and forward at least 50 % of packets on the new route. Flow characteristics are examined to determine ways to improve FBC sensitivity. We show that implementing a maximum flow length of 200 seconds improves the response to route changes significantly with a minimal {{decrease in the number}} of switched packets (1. 5 %) ...|$|E
50|$|The Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) is an {{extension}} of the ATM ARP routing mechanism that is sometimes used to improve the efficiency of routing computer network traffic over Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) Networks. It is defined in IETF RFC 2332, and further described in RFC 2333. It can be used by a sender to determine a route with the fewest number of hops to a receiver. The protocol differs from ARP-type protocols in that it allows routing optimization across multiple IP subnets. NHRP is implemented by means of next-hop servers across IP subnets. The NHRP forms a part of the <b>Multiprotocol</b> Encapsulation <b>over</b> <b>ATM</b> (MPOA) protocol as described in RFC 2684. It also plays a role in Cisco's Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network. A limitation of NHRP is its inability to improve multicast protocols.|$|R
