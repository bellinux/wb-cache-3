Here, we elucidated the significance of giant enteric symbionts colonizing these fishes regarding their roles in the digestive processes of hosts feeding predominantly on polysiphonous red algae and brown Turbinaria algae, which contain different polysaccharide constituents. Using metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and metatranscriptomic analyses, we provide evidence of metabolic diversification of enteric microbiota involved in the degradation of algal biomass in these fishes. The enteric <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> phylogenetically and functionally simple relative to the complex lignocellulose-degrading microbiota of terrestrial herbivores. Over 90 % of the enzymes for deconstructing algal polysaccharides emanate from members of a single bacterial lineage...|$|E
30|$|The {{microbial}} {{populations that}} {{reside in the}} digestive tract of animals are diverse and numerous. Generally, bacteria comprise 40 – 45 % of fecal material on a dry weight basis with populations often exceeding 1011 colony-forming unit (CFU) per gram feces (Eckburg et al. 2005; Stephe and Cummings 1980). The bacteria of the animal gastrointestinal tract constitutes a complex ecosystem which is involved in host physiology, ranging from the structure and functions of the digestive system and the innate and adaptive immune systems, to host energy metabolism (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2004). Conversely, {{the composition of the}} intestinal <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> influenced by diet, social interactions, antibiotic use, host anatomy and phylogeny (Russell and Rychlik 2001; Ley et al. 2008 b). Although there is a profound relationship between intestinal bacteria and animal health, this ecosystem of many herbivores remains incompletely characterized and its diversity poorly defined.|$|E

At each sampling round, hindgut contents of 40 fish (20 per diet) were pooled according to diet and cultivated on selective agar. The functional status of all <b>microbiota</b> <b>was</b> assessed against 48 substrates using the PhPlate generalized microplate, which also yielded a metabolic capacity (MC) value for each microbiota.

40|$|The gut {{microbiota}} modulates host {{metabolism and}} development of immune status. Here we show that the gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a major regulator of bone mass in mice. Germ-free (GF) mice exhibit increased bone mass associated with reduced number of osteoclasts per bone surface compared with conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. Colonization of GF mice with a normal gut microbiota normalizes bonemass. Furthermore, GFmice have decreased frequency of CD 4 þ T cells and CD 11 bþ/GR 1 osteoclast precursor cells in bonemarrow, which could be normalized by colonization. GF mice exhibited reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines in bone and bone marrow compared with CONV-R mice. In summary, the gut microbiota regulates bone mass in mice, and we provide evidence for a mechanism involving altered immune status in bone and thereby affected osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

Genome-wide association studies in IgAN have identified susceptibility genes that are involved in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal inflammation, and the intestinal response to mucosal pathogens, indicating a gut−kidney connection. However, the role of gut microbiota in mediating gut−kidney communication is still underappreciated. Here we highlight current clues that link microbiota with IgAN, and suggest contact points where the microbiota may exert its influence on the onset and progression of IgAN. More specifically, bacterial lipopolysaccharide potentially affects 2  essential components involved in IgAN pathogenesis: the overproduction and hypogalactosylation of IgA 1. Short-chain fatty acids can modulate the inflammatory process and protect against renal damage; however, this protection is lost when the intestinal microbiota changes, becomes imbalanced, and becomes dysbiotic.

The profile of the gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> known to alter with aging and these changes have been linked the declines in the immunity observed in immunosenescence. For example, above the age of 60 years populations of bifidobacteria have been observed to decrease markedly, leading to a reduction in the inhibition of the growth of some pathogens and potentially an increase in the susceptibility to infections. As such, an interest exists in attempting to reverse their decline in elderly individuals, through the use of both probiotics and prebiotics. Both approaches have shown to be encouraging in altering microbiota profiles beneficially and in reducing immunosenescence by reducing the colonisation potential of pathogens and counteracting chronic inflammation. The current review will give an overview of the process of immunosenescence and its role in disease, detail how the microbiota are involved in its progression and highlight data suggesting that pre- and probiotics may counteract these age-related events...|$|E

The gut microbiota of the infants harbored distinct microbial communities that had low similarity with the various maternal microbiota communities.

The gut microbiota are key to developing barrier function, integrity, and mucosal and systemic immune function. They also ‘educate’ the gut associated lymphoid tissue, allowing the establishment of a ‘tolerant’ state between microbiota and the immune system, affecting intestinal function including tight junction structure and immune function. 4 – 6 Patterns of initial colonisation affect host metabolic function: fat deposition, circulating leptin levels, and insulin resistance. 6 In the preterm gut structural and immunological immaturity contribute to inflammatory necrosis and abnormal bacterial colonisation (dysbioses). This may result in decreased microbial diversity and an increased inflammatory response exacerbated by an immature innate immune response that increases the risk of diseases like NEC or LOS. An improved understanding of the microbiota of infants cared for in neonatal intensive care, and how this is affected by current practices may allow clinicians to promote more ‘healthy’ gut microbiota patterns, and may be associated with reductions in mortality and improvements in long term outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{recognized that the}} gut microbiota, the community of organisms living within the gastrointestinal tract {{is an integral part}} of the human body, and that its genoma (the microbiome) interacts with the genes expressed by the cells of the host organism. Several important physiological functions require the cooperation of microbiota/microbiome, whose alterations play an important role in several human diseases. On this basis, it is probable that microbiota/microbiome may in part be involved in many biological effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). There are still few reports on the possible toxicological effects of ENMs on microbiota/microbiome, and on their possible clinical consequences. Available data suggest that several ENMs, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), titanium dioxide, cerium dioxide, zinc oxide, nanosilica and nanosilver may affect the microbiota and that clinical disorders such as colitis, obesity and immunological dysfunctions might follow. On the other hand, other ENMs such as iron nanoparticles may show advantages over traditional iron-based supplemental treatment because they do not interfere with the microbiota/microbiome, and some ENM-based therapeutic interventions might be employed for treating intestinal infections, while sparing the microbiota. The final section of the review is focused on the possible future developments of the research in this field: new in vitro and in vivo models, possible biomarkers and new pathophysiological pathways are proposed and discussed, as well as the possibility that metabolic changes following ENMs/microbiota interactions might be exploited as a fingerprint of ENM exposure.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the gut microbiota to health is becoming more widely appreciated. The range of commensal microorganisms in healthy individuals and in patients {{with a variety of}} digestive diseases is under active investigation, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that both the diversity and balance of bacterial species are important for health. Disturbance of the balance of microorganisms – dysbiosis – is associated with obesity and a variety of diseases. Restoring the balance by modulating the microbiota through diet, probiotics, or drugs is now being developed as a potential treatment for digestive diseases. Rifaximin has been shown to increase levels of beneficial bacterial species without perturbing the overall composition of the microbiota in patients with a variety of digestive diseases, making it a ‘eubiotic’ rather than an antibiotic. Rifaximin has demonstrated clinical benefit in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, where changes in the colonic microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. Modulating the <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a promising treatment for some types of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that have been linked to an overgrowth of coliform and Aeromonas species in the small intestine.

While many aspects of the balance of gut microbiota in disease are not yet fully understood, the new understanding of rifaximin as a modulator of gut microbiota may open up new treatment options in digestive disease. ...|$|E

Advances in sequencing and computational technology have facilitated determination of the role of the intestinal microbiota in CRC however little research have been done investigating the co-variation between age, tumor progression and microbiota. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the microbial composition in cecum from A/J Min/+ mice and how the composition varies with tumor progression and age.

Thus, understanding the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota, {{as well as the}} potential for such populations to act as a reservoir for resistance genes, is imperative. This thesis set out to investigate the gut microbiota of antibiotic treated infants compared to untreated controls using high-throughput DNA sequencing. The results demonstrated the significant effects of antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased proportions of Proteobacteria and decreased proportions of Bifidobacterium. The species diversity of bifidobacteria was also reduced. This thesis also highlights the ability of the human gut microbiota to act as an antibiotic resistance reservoir. Using metagenomic DNA extracted from faecal samples from adult males, PCR was employed to demonstrate the prevalence and diversity of aminoglycoside and β-lactam resistance genes in the adult gut microbiota and highlighted the merits of the approach adopted. Using infant faecal samples, we constructed and screened a second fosmid metagenomic bank for the same families of resistance genes and demonstrated that the infant gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a reservoir for resistance genes. Using in silico analysis we highlighted the existence of putative aminoglycoside and β-lactam resistance determinants within the genomes of Bifidobacterium species. In the case of the β- lactamases, these appear to be mis-annotated. However, through homologous recombination-mediated insertional inactivation, we have demonstrated that the putative aminoglycoside resistance proteins do contribute to resistance.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has become more}} and more evident that the {{bacterial}} flora in the gut of warm-blooded animals modulates physiological processes and the immunological status of the host. Besides effects on growth parameters, commensal intestinal bacteria balance the immune system and prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The question is if the gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> important in lower vertebrates such as fish? And does it play a role in connection to pathogenic challenge? To examine these questions rainbow trout fry were fed two different diets of either a marine or vegetable origin directly after first feeding. At a size of about four gram the fish were bath challenged by Yersinia ruckeri and intestines were then sampled 5 and 18 days post challenge for subsequent metagenomic and immunological examinations. Next-generation sequencing was applied for the metagenomic studies using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The results clearly showed two different microbial patterns in the intestines dependent on the diet type. Control fish fed a marine based diet overall had a higher amount of proteobacteria, while high amount of reads belonging to phylum Firmicutes dominated in the intestines of vegetable fed fish. Several genera within the order Lactobacillales belonged to the many reads from Firmicutes. In challenged fish with a high load of reads from genus Yersinia there was a significantly lower amount of reads from the order Burkholderiales. Further, these fish further clustered separately when analyzing the bacterial community on a PCA plot. The immunological examinations using RT-qPCR showed no different expression patterns between the diet groups in control fish, but the response was very different in connection to challenge. Here, the general pattern was a pro-inflammatory response in the intestine of marine fed fish challenged with Yersinia ruckeri, while several immune genes were down-regulated in vegetable fed fish. Overall, the results indicate that the gut microbiota in rainbow trout is highly plastic according to the type of diet and does further seem {{to be involved in the}} immunological response in connection to pathogenic challenge...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate early {{microbial}} colonisation of the gut dramatically {{affects the}} incidences of infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, a concept {{embraced by the}} ‘Hygiene Hypothesis’. Hence, factors which influence microbial colonisation and succession during early life {{have important implications for}} both human and animal health. This thesis addressed some of the basic principles of the ‘Hygiene Hypothesis’ by investigating how early-life environment impacts on microbial diversity of the adult gut, and how this in turn affects development of the mucosal immune system. The developing pig was used as an experimental model to study host-microbe interactions in early life. The mucosa-adherent <b>microbiota</b> <b>was</b> characterised using both 16 S rRNA gene libraries and DGGE and the corresponding host response determined using Affymetrix microarray technology. Initial colonisation of animals derived from two rearing systems with distinct levels of hygiene (outdoor ‘organic/rural’ and indoor ‘hygienic/urban’) was characterised by a highly diverse <b>microbiota</b> that <b>was</b> similar between treatments. These early microbial colonisers were unrelated to those found colonising the adult gut. Establishment of the adult microbiota required continual environmental exposure which led to microbial succession and stabilisation at the adult life-stage. A natural microbiota dominated by Firmicutes reduced both microbial diversity and the number of pathogenic micro-organisms within the gut ecosystem. It also facilitated enhanced innate immune responses. The impact of long-term antibiotic use on the mucosal <b>microbiota</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> investigated. This resulted in a sustained disturbance of the gut microbiota which contained phylotypes of a pathogenic phenotype and correlated with altered host immune responses. The work presented supports the concept of the ‘Hygiene Hypothesis’ and has identified windows of opportunity during early life when appropriate manipulation of the mucosal microbiota may enhance immune function and natural disease resistance of the host. Prophylactic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in early life is not beneficial to the host. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) {{is one of}} the {{important}} mycotoxins that contaminate a wide range of food commodities available in the market. In this study, methodologies for analyzing OTA in commodities such as, roasted coffee, cocoa and meat were evaluated. The methods with the best recovery rates were used to analyze the incidence of OTA in these food products. Among different samples analyzed, predominantly 35 % of the cocoa samples and 3 % of meat samples were contaminated with OTA. Decaffeinated coffee samples showed the highest incidence of contamination (16. 7 %). Also as a part of this study, Veratox TM (Neogen, MI) ELISA test kit was validated for quantification of OTA in meat using a modified extraction method. Results for recovery, repeatability, cross-reactivity and robustness and linearity showed that the method was suitable for the analysis. Incidence of OTA levels in dried fruits was evaluated and among them raisins and dates showed high levels of incidence of OTA (100 % and 70 %, respectively). Fungal <b>microbiota</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> isolated from dried fruits was characterized and different strains of A. niger and A. tubingensis were identified. All the characterized isolates were tested for OTA production and 36. 8 % among them were OTA producers. Most of the OTA producers were identified as Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus tubingensis.

40|$|International audienceBacteria may {{adhere to}} and develop biofilm {{structures}} onto dairy surfaces {{trying to protect}} themselves from adverse conditions such as pasteurization and CIP processes. Thus, biofilms are considered common sources of food contamination with undesirable bacteria. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the diversity of the microbiota attached to stainless steel surfaces in pre- and post-pasteurization pipe lines of a milk-processing plant. Seventy Gram-positive isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (33), Bacillus cereus (26), Staphylococcus hominis (8), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis-Staphylococcus aureus (1) species. Fifty-five Gram-negative isolates were identified to the species Escherichia coli (18), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (6), Serratia marcescens (6), Enterobacter spp. (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia vulneris (2), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Fifty-five different strains were detected by the RAPD technique. These were subjected to an in vitro assay to evaluate their biofilm-forming capability. E. faecalis (7), A. calcoaceticus (4), K. pneumoniae (3), S. hominis (3), and P. aeruginosa (2) were the species in which more biofilm producer strains were encountered. The adhered <b>microbiota</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> assessed by the PCR-DGGE culture-independent technique. This analysis revealed a greater bacterial diversity than that revealed by culturing methods. In this way, in addition to the bacteria detected by culturing, DNA bands belonging to the genera Chrysobacterium and Streptomyces <b>were</b> <b>also</b> identified. This study emphasizes that knowledge of attached microorganisms to dairy surfaces may help develop strategies to improve optimal operational parameters for pasteurization and CIP processes in dairy plants...|$|R

Pregnancy process is accompanied by substantial hormonal, metabolic and immunological changes during which gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> remarkably remodeled. Dietary fiber has been demonstrated to have a striking role in shifting the microbial composition so as to improve host metabolism and health in non-pregnant individuals. The present study was conducted to investigate effects of adding a soluble dietary fiber inulin (0 or 1. 5 %) to low- or high- fat (0 or 5 % fat addition) gestational diet on maternal and neonatal health and fecal microbial composition in a sow model. Results showed that inulin addition decreased the gestational body weight gain and fat accumulation induced by fat addition. Circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6, adipokine leptin and chemerin were decreased by inulin supplementation. Inulin addition remarkably reduced the average BMI of newborn piglets and the within litter BMI distributions (%) ranging between 17 and 20 kg/m 2, and increased the BMI distribution ranging between 14 and 17 kg/m 2. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the V 3 -V 4 region showed that fecal microbial changes at different taxonomic levels triggered by inulin addition predisposed the pregnant sow to be thinner and lower inflammatory. Meanwhile, fecal microbial composition was also profoundly altered by gestation stage with distinct changes occurring at perinatal period. Most representative volatile fatty acid (VFA) producing-related genera changed dramatically when reaching the perinatal period and varied degrees of increases were detected with inulin addition. Fecal VFA concentrations failed to show any significant effect with dietary intervention, however, were markedly increased at perinatal period. Our findings indicate that positive microbial changes resulted by 1. 5 % soluble fiber inulin addition would possibly be the potential mechanisms under which maternal body weight, metabolic and inflammatory status and neonatal BMI were improved. Besides, distinct changes of microbial community at perinatal period indicated the mother sow is undergoing a catabolic state with increased energy loss and inflammation response at that period compared with other stages of gestation...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{represents}} {{a major public}} health problem {{in the world and}} is nowadays recognized as an epidemic disease. Obesity and overweight are associated with a cluster of metabolic disorders such as type- 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases thereby constituting a leading risk for global deaths. Identifying novel targets with therapeutic potential would bring hope to control obesity whereas actual drugs are particularly ineffective to treat or prevent this epidemic disease. Metabolic alterations related to obesity are associated with a low-grade inflammation that contributes to the onset of these disorders. The gut microbiota has been associated with several hallmarks of metabolic syndrome and growing evidence suggests that gut microbes contribute to the onset of the low-grade inflammation characterizing these metabolic disorders via mechanisms associated with gut barrier dysfunctions. Moreover, gut microbiota modulations using prebiotics such as in inulin-type fructans improve gut barrier functions, metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation in obesity and type- 2 diabetes. This work was aimed to identify novel potential mechanisms involved in the cross-talk between gut microbiota and the host to control gut permeability, inflammation and metabolic disorders associated with obesity. We discovered that gut microbiota modulation using prebiotic treatment increases the number of enteroendocrine cells (i. e., L-cells) producing GLP- 1 and GLP- 2 in the jejunum and colon. These peptides are involved in the beneficial effects of prebiotics on glucose homeostasis and gut barrier functions respectively. Thus, these results suggest that targeting enteroendocrine L-cells could be a novel therapeutic approach to treat the disorders associated with obesity and type- 2 diabetes. Moreover we have discovered that gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> able to control leptin sensitivity in diet-induced obese and type- 2 diabetic mice and this could participate to the beneficial effects of gut microbiota modulation in obesity. By profiling the gut microbiota after prebiotic treatment in obese mice we identified a catalog of putative bacterial targets that may affect host-metabolism in obesity and diabetes. Among these bacteria we concentrated in particular on Akkermansia muciniphila which is a mucin-degrading bacterium that resides in the mucus layer. We found that the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila is decreased in obese and type- 2 diabetic mice and we demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila treatment is able to reverse high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders, including fat-mass gain, metabolic endotoxemia, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance. Importantly, these effects could be mediated by mechanisms depending on interactions between gut microbiota, enteroendocrine functions, endocannabinoid system and immune system since Akkermansia muciniphila administration increased the intestinal levels of endocannabinoids that control inflammation, the gut barrier, and gut peptide secretion and also abolished gut barrier dysfunction by restoring mucus layer thickness and stimulating the production of colon antimicrobial proteins (i. e., regenerating islet-derived 3 -gamma, RegIIIγ) during obesity. The last part of the thesis was dedicated to studying the role of the innate immune system in the interaction between gut microbiota, intestinal immune functions and host metabolism. In conclusion, this work revealed novel mechanisms involved in interactions between gut microbiota and the host epithelium to control gut barrier functions and metabolic disorders associated with obesity. We have identified potential targets such as the modulation of host-gut microbiota interactions through the regulation of enteroendocrine functions, the intestine endocannabinoid and the intestine immune system. We propose that some of these targets could constitute interesting novel therapeutic approaches for the development of drugs to treat and, or prevent obesity and type- 2 diabetes.

40|$|The {{determination}} of a symbiotic association as beneficial requires good {{assessment of the}} costs and benefits involved in the maintenance and transmission of these microbes across generations. In social insects, symbiotic associations are complex as they may involve a network of interactions between individual and colony that result in stable associations over evolutionary time. My goal was to investigate the roles of behavior and morphology as integrators that have enabled the benefits of harboring gut microbes to reach both adult and growing brood in a colony. To achieve this goal, I used turtle ants (Cephalotes), a group that has co-evolved with their gut microbes since the Eocene (Sanders et al. 2014) and that shows a variety of morphological and behavioral specializations likely connected to this symbiotic association. In my dissertation I present evidence that the specialized behavior and morphology of Cephalotes are indeed strongly associated with mechanisms that ensure stability of ant-gut microbe interactions over evolutionary time. In Appendix A, I show that a valve between the crop and midgut (proventriculus) of C. rohweri works as a filtration organ, capable of excluding possible pathogens from the mostly liquid diet consumed by turtle ants. In addition, the proventricular filter is also associated with the structuring of the gut microbiota, dividing it in at least two great groups: one upstream and another downstream of the proventriculus. Through behavioral observation and microscopy, we also suggest that the formation of the proventricular filter is only complete after young and sterile workers (callows) are inoculated with the core group of symbiotic bacteria. In Appendix B, I present results confirming that the compartmentalization of gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> present in the congener C. varians. I compare these results with previously published data, defining the meta-communities of the gut microbiota, and demonstrate that the previously recognized core microbiota is composed of compartment-specific microbial communities and lineages. This compartmentalization of the gut microbiota is similar to the one found in highly specialized herbivores, both vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, I also sampled the infrabuccal pocket, a characteristic oral cavity found in ants and that has largely been ignored in studies of gut symbiosis. Based on my results, I provide compelling evidence that hindgut microbes are inoculated into food particles trapped in the infrabuccal pocket, aiding in digestion of this substrate. Moreover, I suggest that trophallaxis olays a central role in inoculation of food and individuals, and might be responsible for the transmission of nutrients that are predicted to result from the gut bacteria metabolism. Finally, in Appendix C I characterize abdominal trophallaxis in C. rohweri to gain insight on its role in the context of symbiotic associations with gut microbes. I show that the hindgut contents, including bacteria, can be transmitted via abdominal trophallaxis. This interaction is found to occur between all combinations of major and minor workers, in addition to callows. The rate of solicitation of abdominal trophallaxis is higher when individuals are protein starved, indicating that hindgut content may also be nutritive. Using shotgun metagenomic data, we show that the microbiota present in the infrabuccal pocket (mostly hindgut bacteria) are indeed capable of re-utilizing nitrogen and synthesizing essential amino acids, in addition to breaking down plant material. We also report that oral trophallaxis is a possible route for transmission of crop-specific bacteria for callows, as this group has performed oral trophallaxis at a relatively higher rate than older workers. Put together, these results highlight the importance of nestmate interactions and gut morphology in the establishment and maintenance of symbiotic microbes in a social insect, introducing a new model for explaining the evolution and functioning of ant-gut microbe symbiosis...|$|E
40|$|Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease {{that affects the}} function {{of a number of}} organs, principally the lungs, but also the gastrointestinal tract. The manifestations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as frequent antibiotic exposure, undoubtedly disrupts the gut microbiota. To analyse the effects of CF and its management on the microbiome, we compared the gut microbiota of 43 individuals with CF during a period of stability, to that of 69 non-CF controls using 454 -pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene.

40|$|Several substances, {{including}} glutamine and {{propionic acid}} but in particular butyric acid, {{have been proposed}} to be important for colonic health. β-Glucans lead {{to the formation of}} comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer’s spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of β-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the <b>microbiota</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} is {{a cluster of}} three or more metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. Obesity has become the epidemic {{of the twenty-first century}} with more than 1. 6 billion overweight adults. Due to the strong connection between obesity and type 2 diabetes, obesity has received wide attention with subsequent coining of the term “diabesity. ” Recent studies have identified unique contributions of the immensely diverse gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Several mechanisms have been proposed including altered glucose and fatty acid metabolism, hepatic fatty acid storage, and modulation of glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1. Importantly, the relationship between unhealthy diet and a modified gut microbiota composition observed in diabetic or obese subjects has been recognized. Similarly, the role of diet rich in polyphenols and plant polysaccharides in modulating gut bacteria and its impact on diabetes and obesity {{have been the subject of}} investigation by several research groups. Gut <b>microbiota</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> responsible for the extensive metabolism of polyphenols thus modulating their biological activities. The aim of this review is to shed light on the composition of gut microbes, their health importance and how they can contribute to diseases as well as their modulation by polyphenols and polysaccharides to control obesity and diabetes.
