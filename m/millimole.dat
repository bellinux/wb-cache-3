Leaf cell sap and extracts from aqueously isolated spinach chloroplasts were analyzed for mineral cations, anions, amino acids, sugars, and quarternary ammonium compounds. Total osmolality of leaf sap and photosynthetic capacity of leaves were also measured. For comparison, leaf sap from salt-treated pea plants was also analyzed. Spinach plants under NaCl or NaNO 3 salinity took up large amounts of sodium (up to 400 <b>millimoles</b> per liter); nitrate as the accompanying anion was taken up less (up to 90 <b>millimoles</b> per liter) than chloride (up to 450 <b>millimoles</b> per liter). Under chloride salinity, nitrate content in leaves decreased drastically, but total amino acid concentrations remained constant. This response was much more pronounced (and occurred at lower salt concentrations) in leaves from the glycophyte (pea, Pisum sativum var “Kleine Rheinländerin”) than from moderately salt-tolerant spinach. In spinach, sodium chloride or nitrate taken up into leaves was largely sequestered in the vacuoles; both salts induced synthesis of quarternary ammonium compounds, which were accumulated mainly in chloroplasts (and cytosol). This prevented impairment of metabolism, as indicated by an unchanged photosynthetic capacity of leaves...|$|R

Carboxylation efficiency and CO 2 compensation concentrations in leaves of F. floridana developed under the different CO 2 concentrations were intermediate to F. pringlei and F. trinervia. When grown for 12 days at an O 2 concentration of 20 <b>millimoles</b> per mole, apparent photosynthesis was strongly inhibited in Panicum milioides (C 3 -C 4) {{and to a lesser}} degree in Panicum laxum (C 3). In P. milioides, acute starch buildup was observed microscopically in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells.

Because conductance increases were not observed following red light pulses of the same or greater (30 seconds by 0. 200 <b>millimole</b> per square meter per second) fluences, the responses observed could be reliably attributed to the specific blue light response of the guard cells, rather than to guard cell chlorophyll. In both Paphiopedilum harrisianum, which lacks guard cell chloroplasts, and Commelina, the blue light response was enhanced by 0. 263 <b>millimole</b> per square meter per second continuous background red light. Thus, the blue light response and its enhancement do not require energy derived from red-light-driven photophosphorylation by the guard cell chloroplasts. In Commelina, reduction of the intercellular concentration of CO 2 by manipulation of ambient CO 2 concentrations resulted in an enhanced blue light response. In both Commelina and Paphiopedilum, the blue light response was decreased by an increased vapor pressure difference.

After ischemia/reperfusion, this increased {{to an average}} of 27.4  ml oxygen per <b>millimole</b> of reabsorbed sodium in the vehicle group. A possible mechanism for this is that the renal tubular cells loose the integrity of the tight junctions due to ischemia and that NaK-ATPase redistributes to the apical membrane of tubular cells [40]. This in turn causes backward leakage of the reabsorbed sodium to the tubular lumen and faulty active transport of sodium from the intracellular domain to the urine [41]. If the function of the NaK-ATPase is intact, this will lead to increased oxygen-dependent transport of sodium without effective reabsorption. The PDNO-treated sheep displayed a significantly lower ratio between consumed oxygen and reabsorbed sodium, perhaps indicating less ischemic injury to tubular function.|$|E

2500|$|Sweetness, usually {{regarded}} as a pleasurable sensation, is produced {{by the presence of}} sugars and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein coupled receptors coupled to the G protein gustducin found on the taste buds. At least two different variants of the [...] "sweetness receptors" [...] must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human detection threshold for sucrose is 10 <b>millimoles</b> per liter. For lactose it is 30 <b>millimoles</b> per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 <b>millimoles</b> per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin. The gustducin then activates the molecule adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the production of the molecule cAMP, or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate.

Synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.|$|R
