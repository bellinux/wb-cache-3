40|$|A new, simple, sensitive, {{and rapid}} {{spectrophotometric}} method is {{proposed for the}} determination of trace amounts of thallium(III). The method {{is based on the}} oxidation of <b>methiomeprazine</b> hydrochloride by thallium(III) in phosphoric acid medium to give a blue radical cation, having a maximum absorption at 645 nm. Beer’s law is valid over the concentration range 0. 5 { 4. 0 g mL− 1, with molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity of 3. 2 104 L mol− 1 cm− 1 and 0. 0064 g cm− 2, respectively. The detection limit of thallium determination is 0. 01 g mL− 1. The tolerance limits for interfering ions are discussed. All variables were studied in order to optimize the reaction conditions. The ecacy of the proposed method is shown by the successful determination of traces of thallium in alloys, minerals, standard reference materials, water, and urine samples.

40|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} for the molecular weight determination and analytical assay of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPH), diethazine hydrochloride (DH), dioxopromethazine hydrochloride (DPH) and <b>methiomeprazine</b> hydrochloride (MMH). The methods are based on the formation of charge-transfer complexes of the above phenothiazinc derivatives with picric acid (PA). The proposed methods offer the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity and good accuracy. The relative errors are found to be within +/- 2. 00 % The methods are economical compared to other costly instrumental methods of analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methiomeprazine</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{is proposed}} as a selective spectrophotometric reagent for the detn. of Se(IV). The reagent forms a blue-colored species with Se(IV) instantaneously in H 3 PO 4 medium. The blue species exhibits max. absorbance at 644 nm. Beer's law is valid over the concn. range 0. 1 - 2. 2 ppm Se. The {{sensitivity of the}} reaction is 2. 6 ng cm- 2 and the molar absorptivity is 2. 983 Ã� 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1.
