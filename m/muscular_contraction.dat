5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
25|$|Nerves {{control the}} {{contraction}} of muscles by determining the number, sequence, and force of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> When a nerve experiences synaptic fatigue it becomes unable {{to stimulate the}} muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring pathology, neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.|$|E
25|$|Following amputation, most annelids {{are capable}} of sealing their body via rapid <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> Constriction of body muscle can lead to {{infection}} prevention. In certain species, like Limnodrilus, autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{studies were}} carried out in 10 women to {{determine}} whether TRH stimulates <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> in the genitourinary system. TRH (500 micrograms) or saline was administered iv as a bolus injection. Whereas saline had no effect, TRH increased intraurethral pressures in all women, vaginal pressure in 7, and bladder pressure in none. These findings suggest that TRH, acting centrally, peripherally, or both, {{may play a role in}} initiating <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> in the female genitourinary tract...|$|R
50|$|The venom of Latrodectus corallinus is neurotoxic, and is {{accompanied}} with <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions,</b> pain, and sweating (latrodectism). Bites {{are treated with}} antivenom and painkillers.|$|R
25|$|The {{bottom side}} of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> on the {{underside}} of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of mucus that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues. Around the edge of the foot in some taxa is a structure called the 'foot fringe'.|$|E
25|$|Health. Some alleles of actin cause diseases; {{for this}} reason {{techniques}} for their detection have been developed. In addition, actin {{can be used as}} an indirect marker in surgical pathology: it is possible to use variations in the pattern of its distribution in tissue as a marker of invasion in neoplasia, vasculitis, and other conditions. Further, due to actin’s close association with the apparatus of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> its levels in skeletal muscle diminishes when these tissues atrophy, it can therefore be used as a marker of this physiological process.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{were once}} {{believed}} to exchange gases {{with the environment}} continuously by the simple diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns have been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.|$|E

25|$|Vibrational therapy {{by way of}} {{sinusoidal}} (high-frequency oscillating) {{electric current}} was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> but no pain could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
25|$|The {{larval stage}} of the beetle {{typically}} goes through two instars, the second instar is the longest stage of its entire development, taking up 39% of the overall development time. It takes 5.1 days +/- 0.1 on average for the first instar to develop into the second. The larval form of the insect will range in length from three millimeters to several centimeters. They have a membranous body with {{a limited amount of}} sclerotization around the head. There is some pigmentation around the body and it is horizontally segmented. The legs are short and do not help much in locomotion. They move mostly through <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colour change permits {{camouflage}} against different backgrounds. In {{the context}} of deception, this {{can be used as}} a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and mating. Colour change is made possible by chromatophores; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Inside the chromatophore cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction,</b> changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.|$|E
25|$|In a {{clinical}} context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> involved during sexual activity, {{along with the}} characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth. This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> in the pelvic region. However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent. At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal Clinical Psychology Review.|$|R

25|$|Coleoid {{cephalopods}} (including octopuses, squids and cuttlefish) have complex multicellular organs {{that they}} use to change colour rapidly, producing {{a wide variety of}} bright colours and patterns. Each chromatophore unit is composed of a single chromatophore cell and numerous muscle, nerve, glial, and sheath cells. Inside the chromatophore cell, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus. To change colour the animal distorts the sacculus form or size by <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction,</b> changing its translucency, reflectivity, or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians, and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed, rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell. However, a similar effect is achieved.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of molecular biology {{is also the}} encounter of two disciplines which made considerable progress {{in the course of}} the first thirty years of the twentieth century: biochemistry and genetics. The first studies the structure and function of the molecules which make up living things. Between 1900 and 1940, the central processes of metabolism were described: the process of digestion and the absorption of the nutritive elements derived from alimentation, such as the sugars. Every one of these processes is catalyzed by a particular enzyme. Enzymes are proteins, like the antibodies present in blood or the proteins responsible for <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> As a consequence, the study of proteins, of their structure and synthesis, became one of the principal objectives of biochemists.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{effects from}} anatoxin-a {{progress}} very rapidly because it acts {{directly on the}} nerve cells (neurons). The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-a exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Stimulation of these receptors causes a <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> The anatoxin-a molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, {{and in this way}} it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-a does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa may {{occasionally}} {{be found}} within the lumen of the glands, even though the vesicles are blind-ended in nature. This {{is thought to be}} because of slight reflux due to <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> of the urethra during ejaculation.|$|R

50|$|Like all slugs, {{the yellow}} slug moves {{relatively}} slowly, gliding along using {{a series of}} <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> {{on the underside of}} its foot, which is lubricated with mucus, such that it leaves a slime trail behind it.|$|R
2500|$|Metabolites are the {{substances}} (generally waste products) {{produced as}} a result of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> [...] They include chloride, potassium, lactic acid, ADP, magnesium (Mg2+), reactive oxygen species, and inorganic phosphate. [...] Accumulation of metabolites can directly or indirectly produce metabolic fatigue within muscle fibers through interference with the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction of the sensitivity of contractile molecules actin and myosin to calcium.|$|E
2500|$|The helical F-actin {{filament}} {{found in}} muscles {{also contains a}} tropomyosin molecule, which is a 40 nanometre long protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin’s active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> [...] There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these are the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T and troponin C.|$|E
2500|$|Nerves are {{responsible}} for controlling the contraction of muscles, determining the number, sequence and force of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction.</b> [...] Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring pathological nervous fatigue, is seldom an issue. But in extremely powerful contractions that {{are close to the}} upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, nervous fatigue (enervation), in which the nerve signal weakens, can be a limiting factor in untrained individuals.|$|E

5000|$|Orgasm: An orgasm is {{the sudden}} {{discharge}} of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> in the pelvic region that will tone the pelvic muscles.

30|$|To {{test the}} delay in the transit time, we {{administered}} loperamide. The drug, loperamide, normally slows the <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> of the intestine and is thus termed as an antimotility agent. Loperamide acts mainly on opioid receptors, which {{are found in the}} walls lining the intestines. This reduces the <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> of the intestine (peristalsis) that move food and fecal matter through the gut. After 6 h of administration, the GI tract was labeled only at the stomach, cecum, and transverse colon. This clearly indicates that the drug has tremendous effect of delaying the transit time. Even 22 h later, the images show the retention of some labeling in the same structures, further supporting the mechanism of drug action.|$|R
2500|$|The helical F-actin {{filament}} {{found in}} muscles {{also contains a}} tropomyosin molecule, a 40-nanometre protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin’s active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> (the interaction {{gives rise to a}} movement between the two proteins that, because it is repeated many times, produces a contraction). [...] There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these include the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C. Tropomyosin’s regulatory function depends on its interaction with troponin in the presence of Ca2+ ions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{special case}} of a {{chemical}} synapse is the neuromuscular junction, in which the axon of a motor neuron terminates on a muscle fiber. In such cases, the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which binds to the acetylcholine receptor, an integral membrane protein in the membrane (the sarcolemma) of the muscle fiber. [...] However, the acetylcholine does not remain bound; rather, it dissociates and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, located in the synapse. This enzyme quickly reduces the stimulus to the muscle, which allows the degree and timing of <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> to be regulated delicately. Some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase to prevent this control, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides diazinon and malathion.|$|E
2500|$|Oxygenated {{water is}} {{taken into the}} mantle cavity to the gills and through <b>muscular</b> <b>contraction</b> of this cavity, the spent water is {{expelled}} through the hyponome, created by a fold in the mantle. [...] The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control {{the speed of the}} jet the organism can produce. The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morphology of animal. [...] Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions. Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators.|$|E
40|$|Pre-performance {{routines}} commonly include {{stretching and}} intense <b>muscular</b> <b>contractions</b> {{in an attempt}} to optimise muscular performance and reduce injury risk.

Techniques including isokinetic dynamometry, electromyography (EMG), sonography and motion analysis were used in three studies on recreationally active human volunteers (n= 20).
