25|$|Note that in {{this example}} we have assumed that {{temperature}} is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> (see heat capacity). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase {{the difference between the}} speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states (electron paramagnetic resonance), molecular rotations, <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions; rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as fluorescence spectroscopy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E

50|$|The IUPAC Gold Book defines an {{intermediate}} as a molecular entity (atom, ion, molecule...) with a lifetime appreciably {{longer than a}} <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> that is formed (directly or indirectly) from the reactants and reacts further to give (either directly or indirectly) the products of a chemical reaction. The lifetime condition distinguishes true, chemically distinct intermediates from vibrational states or such transition states which, by definition have lifetimes close to that of <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration,</b> and thus, intermediates correspond to potential energy minima of depth greater than available thermal energy arising from temperature, (RT, where R is gas constant and T is temperature).|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{is a powerful}} tool which can increase our knowledge on structures and on electron <b>molecular</b> <b>vibrations,</b> which are due to charge oscillation between dimerized moIecuIes,coupled with totally symmetric intramolecular modes.

50|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is excited}} when the {{molecule}} absorbs a quantum of energy, E, {{corresponding to the}} vibration's frequency, ν, according to the relation E = hν (where h is Planck's constant).

50|$|Because {{the energy}} levels of <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> and {{rotation}} are similar, the photons emitted due to transition between these levels have comparatively low energy, and longer wavelength, than visible and near-infrared light.

50|$|The quantum {{mechanics}} for diatomic molecules such as dinitrogen, N2, and fluorine, F2, is qualitatively {{the same as}} for heteronuclear diatomic molecules, but the selection rules governing transitions are different. Since the electric dipole moment of these molecules is zero, the fundamental vibrational transition is electric-dipole-forbidden. However, a weak quadrupole-allowed spectrum of N2 can be observed when using long path-lengths both in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. The spectra of these molecules can be observed by Raman spectroscopy because the <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> is Raman-allowed.|$|E
50|$|The {{peroxide}} ion {{is composed}} of two oxygen atoms that are linked by a single bond. The molecular orbital diagram of the peroxide dianion predicts a doubly occupied antibonding π* orbital and a bond order of one. The bond length is 149 pm, which is larger than in the ground state (triplet oxygen) of the oxygen molecule (3O2, 121 pm). This translates into the smaller force constant of the bond (2.8 N/cm vs. 11.4 N/cm for 3O2) and the lower frequency of the <b>molecular</b> <b>vibration</b> (770 cm−1 vs. 1555 cm−1 for 3O2).|$|E

40|$|The bond order wave (BOW) {{phase of}} half-filled linear Hubbard-type models is narrow and {{difficult}} to characterize aside from a few ground state properties. The BOW phase of a frustrated Heisenberg spin chain is wide and tractable. It has broken inversion symmetry C_i in a regular array and finite gap E_m to the lowest triplet state. The spin-BOW is exact in finite systems at a special point. Its elementary excitations are spin- 1 / 2 solitons that connect BOWs with opposite phase. The same patterns of spin densities and bond orders appear in the BOW phase of Hubbard-type models. Infrared (IR) active lattice phonons or <b>molecular</b> <b>vibrations</b> are derivatives of P, the polarization along the stack. <b>Molecular</b> <b>vibrations</b> that are forbidden in regular arrays become IR active when C_i symmetry is broken. 1 : 1 alkali-TCNQ salts contain half-filled regular TCNQ- stacks at high temperature, down to 100 K in the Rb-TCNQ(II) polymorph whose magnetic susceptibility and polarized IR spectra indicate a BOW phase.
