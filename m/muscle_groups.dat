5|$|There {{are three}} main <b>muscle</b> <b>groups</b> of the forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, {{running from the}} elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and <b>muscle</b> <b>groups</b> in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Better {{measures}} of liver transplant risk stratification are needed. Our previous work noted {{a strong relationship}} between psoas muscle area and survival following liver transplantation. The dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> is easier to measure, but it is unclear if they are also correlated with surgical outcomes. Methods Our study population included liver transplant recipients with a preoperative CT scan. Cross‐sectional areas of the dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> at the T 12 vertebral level were measured. The primary outcomes {{for this study were}} one‐ and five‐yr mortality and one‐yr complications. The relationship between dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> area and post‐transplantation outcome was assessed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Results Dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> area measurements were strongly associated with psoas area (r  =  0. 72; p <  0. 001). Postoperative outcome was observed from 325 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> area to be a significant predictor of one‐yr mortality (odds ratio [OR] =  0. 53, p =  0. 001), five‐yr mortality (OR  =  0. 53, p <  0. 001), and one‐yr complications (OR  =  0. 67, p =  0. 007). Conclusion Larger dorsal <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> <b>muscle</b> size is associated with improved post‐transplantation outcomes. The muscle is easier to measure and may represent a clinically relevant postoperative risk factor...|$|R

5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{are often}} preceded by certain experiences, known as auras. They include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena. Jerking activity may start {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding <b>muscle</b> <b>groups</b> in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other <b>muscle</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion {{combines}} an isolation {{exercise with}} a compound exercise {{for the same}} <b>muscle</b> <b>group.</b> The isolation exercise first exhausts the <b>muscle</b> <b>group,</b> and then the compound exercise uses the <b>muscle</b> <b>group's</b> supporting <b>muscles</b> to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the [...] "bench press" [...] the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits {{the impact on the}} pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.|$|R

50|$|The {{adductor}} brevis is {{a muscle}} in the thigh situated immediately deep to the pectineus and adductor longus. It {{belongs to the}} adductor <b>muscle</b> <b>group.</b> The main function of the adductor brevis is to pull the thigh medially. The adductor brevis {{and the rest of}} the adductor <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> is also used to stabilize left to right movements of the trunk, when standing on both feet, or to balance when standing on a moving surface. The adductor <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> is used pressing the thighs together to ride a horse, and kicking with the inside of the foot in soccer or swimming. Last, they contribute to flexion of the thigh when running or against resistance (squats, jumping, etc.).|$|R

25|$|A muscular {{diaphragm}} helps mammals to breathe, {{especially during}} strenuous activity. For a diaphragm to work, the ribs must not restrict the abdomen, so that {{expansion of the}} chest can be compensated for by reduction in {{the volume of the}} abdomen and vice versa. Diaphragms are known in caseid pelycosaurs, indicating an early origin within synapsids, though they were still fairly inefficient and likely required support from other <b>muscle</b> <b>groups</b> and limb motion.|$|E

25|$|Triathlon {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} optimized for aerodynamics, having special handlebars called aero-bars or tri-bars, aerodynamic wheels, and other components. Triathlon bikes use a specialized geometry, including a steep seat-tube angle both to improve aerodynamics and to spare <b>muscle</b> <b>groups</b> needed for running (see also triathlon equipment). At {{the end of}} the bike segment, triathletes also often cycle with a higher cadence (revolutions per minute), which serves in part to keep the muscles loose and flexible for running.|$|E
25|$|Gymnastics is a sport {{practiced by}} men and women that {{requires}} balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, endurance and control. The movements involved in gymnastics {{contribute to the development of}} the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest and abdominal <b>muscle</b> <b>groups.</b> Alertness, precision, daring, self-confidence and self-discipline are mental traits that can also be developed through gymnastics. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.|$|E
25|$|Dystonia is a {{movement}} disorder in which involuntarily sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting or repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Such abnormal postures include foot inversion, wrist ulnar deviation, or lordotic trunk twisting. They can be localized to specific {{parts of the body}} or be generalized to many different <b>muscle</b> <b>groups.</b> These postures are often sustained {{for long periods of time}} and can be combined in time. Dystonic movements can augment hyperkinetic movements, especially when linked to voluntary movements.|$|E

30|$|A single trained {{individual}} (author KS) assessed peripheral {{muscle strength}} using hand-held dynamometry. The JAMAR (5030 J 1) hydraulic hand dynamometer and the Chatillon dynamometer (K-MSC- 200) {{were used for}} all muscle strength assessments. All measurements were taken in kilograms to the nearest hundredth of a kilogram. Each <b>muscle</b> <b>group</b> (handgrip, triceps, biceps, ankle dorsiflexors, hamstrings and quadriceps) was measured according to previously validated protocols [36]. For each <b>muscle</b> <b>group,</b> patients were asked to exert a maximal effort for 3 – 4  s against the dynamometer, which was in a fixed position. Three measurements were collected for each <b>muscle</b> <b>group,</b> alternating between patient sides between measurements. For each <b>muscle</b> <b>group,</b> the highest force generated on the patient’s dominant side was used for analysis. The National Isometric Muscle Strength Database Consortium [36] was used for age- and sex-standardized normative values. The 6 MWT {{was used to assess}} overall physical functioning. Previously published guidelines and procedures were followed [37], and age and sex normative values were obtained from Enright et al. [38].|$|R
