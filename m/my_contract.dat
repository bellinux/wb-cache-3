When Bruce was unable to {{guarantee}} him a regular place in the team, Horsfield moved on to Wigan Athletic, signing a three-year contract in September 2003. A transfer fee of £500,000 was agreed, though this could have risen to £1million if the player had gone on to make enough appearances for Wigan. Horsfield said of the move, [...] "I could easily have sat out the last two years of <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> at Birmingham, but that's not my style– I just want to play football."

40|$|This essay {{begins with}} a brief {{discussion}} of what socioeconomics is. In this section I also address whether one must be well versed in conventional economics in order to apply a socioeconomic perspective. I then discuss the basic themes that are present throughout <b>my</b> <b>contracts</b> class that stem from my interest in socioeconomics. Underlying these themes is the more fundamental goal of devising methodologies for assessing the quality of contracts. By quality, I mean something more and perhaps more subtle than whether the parties have conformed to all the formal requirements. Instead, I encourage students to examine whether all of the many factors leading {{to the formation of}} a contract are ones to be supported. Finally, I identify some specific materials that lend themselves to a socioeconomic perspective that are not always included in the casebook...|$|R
2500|$|The 2017–18 {{transfer}} window {{started with}} the departure of captain Darren Fletcher to rivals Stoke. The first signing of the summer was the forward Jay Rodriguez from Southampton for a fee of around £12m. Pulis had tried to sign Rodriguez in the two previous transfer windows but Southampton were reluctant to do business. The following day Chinese striker Zhang Yuning joined the club for an undisclosed fee and was immediately loaned to Bundesliga side Werder Bremen for two seasons. The next signing was Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazy who joined on loan with an option to trigger a permanent transfer. There was also a change to the management team with the retirement of long-time assistant Dave Kemp. He was replaced as Assistant Head Coach by former Albion manager Gary Megson. On 11 August 2017 Pulis signed a further contract extension which committed him to the club until 2019. Upon signing he said: [...] "I'm delighted to extend <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> because it continues the stability within the Club which is essential for its progress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his release}} from Shrewsbury, Madjo opted to move abroad, signing for Chinese League One side Guangdong Sunray Cave on a free transfer. He made 18 league {{appearances}} for the club, scoring ten goals. He finished the 2009 campaign as the club's top goalscorer, and fifth in the overall goalscoring charts. The following season, Madjo signed for Albanian Superliga side KS Bylis Ballsh. He made his debut for the club in a 3–2 defeat to KS Vllaznia Shkodër on 22 August 2010, playing the whole 90 minutes. Madjo scored his first goal for the club on 30 October 2010, netting in the first minute of the match as Bylis beat Besa Kavajë 3–1.

Madjo was given a straight red card in the club's 2–1 defeat to KS Kastrioti on 24 December 2010. It was to be Madjo's last game for Bylis. He later said that [...] "I felt that Bylis Ballsh did not respect <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> so I {{sat down with the}} club and cancelled my contract." [...] He made a total of 15 appearances for the Albanian side, scoring twice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Waits {{was extremely}} busy working on movie soundtracks, acting, {{and contributing to}} a number of music projects by other artists. First, Waits appeared on the Primus album Sailing the Seas of Cheese as the voice of [...] "Tommy the Cat", which exposed him to a new audience in alternative rock. This was the first of several collaborations between Waits and the group; Frontman Les Claypool would appear on several subsequent Waits releases. The same year saw Waits provide spoken word contributions to Devout Catalyst, an album by one of Waits' greatest influences, Ken Nordine, on the songs [...] "A Thousand Bing Bangs" [...] and [...] "The Movie." [...] Waits also contributed vocals to a duet with singer Bob Forrest on the song [...] "Adios Lounge" [...] on the Thelonious Monster album Beautiful Mess. He also contributed vocals to two songs ("Little Man" [...] and [...] "I'm Not Your Fool Anymore") on jazz tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards' album Mississippi Lad. Edwards was extremely complimentary of Waits' contributions, saying:Tom Waits is the one who got me <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> with PolyGram. He's wonderful, he's America's best lyricist since Johnny Mercer. He came down to the studio on the Mississippi Lad album, that's the first one I did for PolyGram, and he sang two of my songs, wouldn't accept any money, just trying to give me the best boost that he could.|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when <b>my</b> <b>contract</b> runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate <b>my</b> <b>contract.</b> They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

He added [...] "there {{was no point in}} me moving on because I wasn't good enough!" [...] Thorp went on to bemoan the lack of storylines for Alan saying [...] "I would hate to leave, but I wish they'd find more for me to do". He added that he had suggested that [...] "Turner get a love interest" [...] but that the writers had refused saying [...] "they'd have to dig her up". In 2010 Thorp commented on his role saying the serial has been [...] "very good to me and has renewed <b>my</b> <b>contracts</b> for years, but they have not got as much work for me these days - I'm more like the village memorial now than an active character".|$|R
