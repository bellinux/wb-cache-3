2500|$|Dearlove emphasises that, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of mass higher education, no university can avoid the need {{for some sort of}} bureaucratic <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation,</b> though {{this does not mean that}} the importance of informal discipline and profession-based authority (internal governance of universities) can totally be ignored. [...] Lapworth advocates what the author believes is a model of university governance with the positive aspects of corporate and collegial approaches. [...] The issues in university governance discussed by these literatures are detailed by Coaldrake, Stedman, and Little (2003) through a comparative study of current trends in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with poignant insight into the different models of governance for the management of higher education. Critical of the currents of change toward “corporate governance,” the authors cite reference to literature that calls for “re-balancing” of university governance, maintaining that the re-balancing “would amount to a clarification of shared governance”. [...] With changing roles in human resources and the external pressures for accountability affecting university relationships internally, McMaster provides insights by defining management styles in terms of nested partnership between faculty and administration, contiguous partnership, and segmented partnership. [...] With debates over the recent trends, university organizations, governing associations, and numerous postsecondary institutions themselves have set forth policy statements on governance.|$|E
