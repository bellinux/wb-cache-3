5000|$|The Vulcan IDIC pendant was {{designed}} by Gene Roddenberry as a <b>marketing</b> <b>premium</b> long before the third season. As early {{as the end of}} the first season, fans of the show had begun writing in asking for copies of the scripts, film clip frames, etc., and these were soon sold through Roddenberry's mail-order company, Lincoln Enterprises, founded by Bjo Trimble and her husband John before they were fired by Roddenberry and the business turned over to Majel Barrett. As evidenced in some of his letters and memos, Roddenberry was fond of circle-and-triangle designs and had wanted to use them for purposes of theatrical unity as early as the first season's [...] "The Return of the Archons". As reported by editor Ruth Berman (issue #1, Inside Star Trek, July 1968, pp. 15-16), [...] "ardent rock hound and amateur lapidary" [...] Roddenberry came up with the Vulcan philosophy after he presented Leonard Nimoy with a unique [...] "hand-crafted piece of jewelry", a [...] "pendent" [...] (sic) of polished yellow gold (circle) and florentined white gold (triangle), with a stone of brilliant white fabulite—an artificial gem [...] "developed by the laser industry and used in space mechanisms for its optical qualities", and thus well-suited as a gift for an actor in a science fiction show. Readers were encouraged to submit their interest in such a product to the then-Star Trek Enterprises mail order firm. It was noted that [...] "less expensive materials" [...] would keep costs down.|$|E

This paper empirically examines this issue within {{a cross section}} of countries and finds that the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> is strongly {{associated with}} rising income inequality as measured by changes in the Gini coefficient. Others have used the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> as a proxy to measure protectionist policies so a possible implication is that protectionist policies further skew the distribution of income within a country. However, other measures of protectionist policies are not associated with changes in income inequality. Instead, other factors which might drive the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> such as interest rate differentials appear to be more relevant in explaining why the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> is positively related with increases in income inequality. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>market</b> risk <b>premium</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} but elusive parameters in finance. It is also called equity <b>premium,</b> <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> and risk premium. The term 'market risk premium' is difficult to understand because it is used to designate three different concepts: 1) Required <b>market</b> risk <b>premium,</b> which is the incremental return of a diversified portfolio (the market) over the risk-free rate (return of treasury bonds) required by an investor. It is needed for calculating the required return to equity (cost of equity). 2) Historical <b>market</b> risk <b>premium,</b> which is the historical differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. 3) Expected <b>market</b> risk <b>premium,</b> which is the expected differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. Many authors and finance practitioners assume that the expected <b>market</b> risk <b>premium</b> is equal to the historical <b>market</b> risk <b>premium</b> and to the required <b>market</b> risk <b>premium.</b> The CAPM assumes that the required <b>market</b> risk <b>premium</b> is equal to the expected <b>market</b> risk <b>premium.</b> However, the three concepts are different.

This research uses data elicited from consumer surveys and experimental auctions to provide insight on product attributes (taste/flavour, credence and nutritional characteristics) and socio-demographic factors that are most important in determining US consumers' preferences and willingness to pay premiums for grass-finished versus grain-finished beef. Information related to beef production processes increased the probability consumers {{would be willing to}} pay a premium for grass-fed beef. However, it appears that health-related messages are more important drivers of willingness-to-pay, on average, than the absence of antibiotics and supplemental hormones and traceability. Labelling information regarding grass-fed beef's nutritional content and related production processes is vital for maintaining and growing premium niche markets for grass-fed beef in the US. The relative size of the willingness to pay estimates compared to previous cost estimates suggest that the Australian beef industry may have a comparative advantage for finishing beef on forage and <b>marketing</b> <b>premium</b> grass-fed differentiated beef products in the US market.

40|$|Air filter {{manufacturers}} have recently begun <b>marketing</b> <b>premium</b> air filters that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops. This is accomplished with proprietary filter designs incorporating {{at least twice}} the media surface area of traditional filters. 1 The increased media reduces the initial pressure drop of air filters while dramatically increasing their dust holding capacity. In addition, their useful lives are extended and prefilter use may be eliminated. Physical principals governing airflow in fan systems predict available energy savings from using premium air filters. This energy savings may offset the additional cost of the premium filters. In fact, premium filter investments can payback in six months to three years depending on airflow and number of hours of fan operation. Additional benefits of using premium air filters include longer filter life, lower installation and disposal costs, elimination of prefilters {{and the ability to}} increase effective filter efficiency in buildings without reducing ventilation effectiveness. A case study was conducted in an office building with two nearly identical VAV systems to determine if premium air filters are good investments for building owners and managers. This paper presents performance characteristics including fan energy use and static pressure drops across both premium and typical air filters. The performance data were used to test the validity of one manufacturer’s claim concerning their premium filters, fan energy reduction and improved indoor air quality. Results of this study demonstrated purchase and use of the premium air filters might be good investments for building owners and managers...|$|E

Generally, the black market for foreign exchange arises as {{a direct consequence of}} the adoption of exchange rate controls in many developing economies facing substantial macroeconomic imbalances.

The research attempts to describe the functioning of the black market and find out the determinants of the parallel premium based on a stock-flow model as well as to investigate whether inflation Granger causes the parallel exchange rate. Estimated results reveal that the determinants of the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> are international foreign reserves, real exchange rate, lagged values of the black <b>market</b> <b>premium,</b> expected rate of devaluation, money supply and inflation. On the other hand, inflation and black market are found to Granger-cause each other during the period under consideration.

Using conditional betas the average <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> is positive but not statistically significant. For some individual years a positive statistically significant risk premium is found.

Consequently, after assess the relevance and timeliness of the concept to meet or beat expectations, especially the value-effect in which we present a positive earnings surprise, we {{have looked at the}} mechanisms used by management in order to report earnings above expectations. Subsequently, and based on an approach of the earnings expectations time line, we develop our hypotheses and design our variables. To enhance the consistency of our tests, we consider two metrics to calculate the cumulative abnormal returns: the market model and market adjusted return. We analyze the existence of a <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> for firms of the DJ Stoxx 50 E, which meet or beat expectations. Then, and analyzing expectations path, we infer expectations management in the sample obtained in 636 firms-quarters. Finally, we analyzed the association between the <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> and the existence of expectations management, based on 48 observations in which there was the likelihood of manipulation of expectations. The results for the <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> are consistent with previous studies, and although our sample has a very small size in relation to previous studies, establish the existence of a <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> for companies that meet or beat expectations. Specifically, we obtained a higher return at 3. 1 % for firms that realize and exceed expectations. We can also conclude that the earnings surprise magnitude affects the return of the company. Regarding the presence of expectations management, we detect that there is a significant difference between cases likely to exist expectations management and cases where it is less vi likely that there is expectation management. Thus, we can say that there is expectation management in firms and sample period.
