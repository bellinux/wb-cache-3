40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on SnO 2 coating of SiC particles by sol-gel technique {{and the production of}} SnO 2 coated 20 vol % SiC particle reinforced composite and unreinforced matrix alloy by squeeze casting. The morphology of the coating and microstructural, interfacial and mechanical properties of the composite were characterized by using an optical <b>microscope,</b> <b>image</b> <b>analyzer,</b> scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It has been found that the coating is not degraded during the fabrication process; in other words, SnO 2 coating by sol-gel technique is an effective way to improve the matrix/reinforcement interfacial properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of Si and Mg on ageing behavior of Al– 7 %Si– 0. 7 %Mg matrix composites reinforced with SiC particles of 10 and 20 vol. % and unreinforced matrix alloy. The samples were produced by compocasting technique and extruded. The produced samples were characterized by optical <b>microscope,</b> <b>image</b> <b>analyzer,</b> scanning electron microscope and X-ray mapping. The obtained results were compared with the previous study, which was studied on Al– 5 %Si– 0. 2 %Mg matrix alloy and composites. It has been found that, the formation of some reaction products, mechanical properties and age hardening behavior of the composites strongly depend on Si and Mg content of the matrix alloy. In addition, increasing the Mg and Si content from 0. 2 and 5 wt. % to 0. 7 and 7 wt. % respectively, increase the critical temperature and hardening efficiency values.

The objective of this research is to characterize the response of synthetic bone substitute after subjected to compressive load. Compression test was carried out on INSTRON Universal Tester. The maximum load that the specimen can endure and stress-strain response were obtained from the compression experiment. Qualitative and quantitative characterization was done using scanning electron <b>microscope</b> and <b>image</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The response of the specimen showed multiple yield points during compression. Stress-strain response did not follow any of the response of either ductile or brittle materials. The response was rather strictly nonlinear throughout the test range undergone. In addition, the mode of failure is more to shear. The micrographs reveal porosity range, chemical composition and the smallest cell size sustained after compression.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} relationship of cooling rates towards the intermetallic compound (IMC) morphology. Cooling rate is an important parameter as {{it has significant effect}} towards the IMC microstructure formation that indirectly affects solders joint reliability. However, there is still insufficient study regarding the effect of cooling rate on the IMC thickness and microstructure behavior by using Nickel Boron as surface finish material in the electronic packaging industry. In this study, Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solder was used on Nickel Boron as coating layer. Cooling rates were obtained by cooling specimens in different media which is water and air. The elemental composition was confirmed using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and the microstructure of each IMC then analyzed using optical <b>microscope,</b> <b>image</b> <b>analyzer</b> and ImageJ. In this study, faster cooling rate (water) found to provide thicker IMC (6 μm) compared to the other medium used. The morphology shape of each IMC also differs between different medium of cooling.

40|$|Since 1970, {{measurements}} of aerosol spectra {{have been and}} are being by our institute simultaneously at three stations. We report here on results of the first 11 years, a total of 1500 expositions being available per station. Measurements were made at {{the northern edge of}} the Alps, about 90 km south of Munich, at the valley station Garmisch-Partenkirchen (740 m a. s. l.), on the neighboring Wank peak (1780 m a. s. l.) and the peak of the nearby Zugspitze (2964 m a. s. l.). The measurements were performed by means of a fivefold double-stage impactor after Junge-Jaenicke. Two series-connected impactors with equal slit-width form one unit and each of the five impactor pairs is exposed separately at optimum air flow, corresponding to the slith width. This system of five separate units offers the essential advantage that the impactors for fine particles can be operated with short exposure time which can, however, be extended for impactors for coarser particles. Thereby a homogeneous and optimum de position is achieved for counting the separated particles on the microscope slides. Theoretical bases are explained. The particles deposited on the microscope slide are counted by an automatic <b>microscope</b> <b>image</b> <b>analyzer,</b> being computer-controlled and permitting automatic scanning of particle traces on the slides.

40|$|Using a {{scanning}} electron <b>microscope</b> and an <b>image</b> <b>analyzer,</b> we {{have developed}} a technique for counting and measuring cracks in rocks which is more efficient than traditional techniques in which an operator performs all image analysis functions. The key aspect of the technique is that black-on-white tracings of fresh cracks, which can be made rather quickly by an operator, are fed to an <b>image</b> <b>analyzer</b> which then digitizes and tabulates data. The most time-consuming {{step in the process}} has now become the generation of SEM micrographs and pertinent chemical (mineralogical) information, not the quantification of crack structure. The technique has been applied to two studies involving nuclear waste isolation in a granitic rock, Climax Stock (Nevada Test Site) quartz monzonite, a rock which is structurally very inhomogeneous.

40|$|Due to its {{attractive}} characteristics, {{thin wall}} ductile iron (TWDI), has been increasingly {{considered as a}} preference for reducing material consumption {{in order to save}} energy and contribute less environment pollutions as well as decreasing costs. In this research, the effect of two mould runner gating systems and mould coating on graphite nodule characteristics and hardness value of TWDI casting was studied. Strip samples with various thicknesses of 2. 3, 3. 3, 4. 5, 5. 4, 6. 5, 7. 5 and 8. 5 mm were cast into CO 2 silicate mould designed with two different stepped and tapered runners. Half of the moulds were coated by graphite-based zircon material to investigate the effect of mould coating on the graphite nodule qualities and quantities. Optical <b>microscope</b> and <b>image</b> <b>analyzer</b> were used to evaluate graphite nodule count, roundness and diameter of the TWDI cast samples. Hardness value of all the samples was measured by Brinell hardness testing. The results showed that roundness and count of graphite nodules decreased in microstructure of the samples produced by stepped runner uncoated mould, whilst diameter of graphite nodules showed an opposite behaviour. In addition, molten metal experienced a superior fluidity in coated moulds. Moreover, the TWDI samples achieved a significant improvement in the value of hardness...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the repeatability of morphometric characteristics of counted milk fat globules number of globules/milliliter, average diameter, frequency distribution of globules according to different size analyzed in 3 different phases of lactation (10, 30 and 90 days from parity). Milk samples were taken from 25 Massese ewes homogeneous for age and diet; all the animals came from a single herd located in the province of Pisa (Tuscany). All individual samples were taken from the morning milking and were refrigerated until use, placed in a Burker chamber and observed by fluorescent <b>microscope</b> and <b>image</b> <b>analyzer</b> system. The repeatability of morphometric characteristics of milk fat globules tested in the three phases of lactation was estimated by Pearson's correlations (r) while the average repeatability has been tested across the method of intra-correlation-cl ass. Fat globules tend to change over the course of lactation, and as production progresses, favours an increase in the percentages of small and medium globules and a decreased percentage of the large globules. Only fat globules of 5 - 6 mu m (class 5, 15 % of the total globules) and medium diameter show good repeatability during lactation (0. 41 and 0. 31 respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the major}} cause of lower {{respiratory}} tract infection in infants and young children. Although several experimental RSV vaccines are under investigation, immuno therapy is the only treatment currently available. In assessing the immunogenicity of various vaccine formulations, a plaque reduction neutralization assay {{for the evaluation of}} RSV neutralizing antibody has been widely used. The method produces reliable results, but it is tedious and labor intensive as it relies on manual counting by laboratory personnel. To facilitate evaluation of phase II and phase III vaccine clinical trials, a more rapid, reliable and efficient neutralization assay is needed. Results An improved microneutralization assay for quantifying RSV neutralizing antibodies was developed using an ImmunoSpot ® Series I Analyzer (Cellular Technology Ltd., Cleveland, OH) for automated plaque counting. The method is an improvement of the established classical microneutralization assay in which immunostained plaques on transparent tissue culture plates are counted manually under a dissecting <b>microscope.</b> <b>Image</b> <b>analyzer</b> technology allows for fully automated counting of plaques distributed throughout an entire well. Adjustments, {{such as the use of}} opaque tissue culture plates and the TMB substrate, True Blue™ (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), were required to adapt the assay for optimal detection of plaques by the image analyzer. The suitability and the accuracy of the method for counting RSV plaques were determined by comparative testing of a reference serum and two control sera by manual and automated counting methods. The results showed that the two methods were highly correlated (R = 0. 9580) and the titers generated by them were within two-fold. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that the semi-automated assay is rapid and reliable. It provides results within two fold to the classical plaque microneutralization assay and is readily applied to the evaluation of neutralizing antibody titers in sera obtained from epidemiology or vaccine clinical trials. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Transforming {{growth factor}} (TGF) -beta {{is a member}} of the super-family of polypeptides, which control cell cycle {{progression}} and a variety of other cellular activities. TGF-β 1 has been implicated as an effector of the induction of apoptosis in response to 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (5 ARI) and; therefore, causes a decrease in the prostate volume. We investigated the effect of 5 ARI in the expression of TGF-β 1 in benign prostatic hyper-plasia (BPH). Materials and Methods: 50 patients diagnosed with BPH were divided into two groups. The control group (n= 30), in which a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was performed without medication, and the 5 ARI group (n= 20), who were administrated with 5 mg of 5 ARI daily for at least 3 months, followed by TURP.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} if Isradipine treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) decreased hypertension-dependent left ventricular and coronary vascular hypertrophy. Twelve week male SHR were used in this study; one group of SHR was treated with Isradipine while the control group of SHR was left untreated. Age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were utilized as a reference group. After 12 weeks of treatment rats were sacrificed. The hearts were removed and morphometric analysis was performed on the left ventricles. Isradipine treatment reduced systolic blood pressure in SHR. The heart/body weight ratio significantly increased in SHR and in Isradipine-treated SHR in comparison with WKY rats. Isradipine treatment decreased the left ventricular muscle fibre diameter and decreased the amount of focal necrosis in SHR. Different sized coronary arteries were also examined using a light <b>microscope</b> and an <b>image</b> <b>analyzer.</b> We found that the area occupied by the medial layer and the media-to-lumen ratio were significantly increased in comparison with WKY rats. In Isradipine-treated SHR the area of the medial layer and the media-to-lumen ratio in small and medium sized but not in large sized coronary arteries were significantly reduced in comparison with untreated SHR. The above results suggest that long term Isradipine treatment is not only able to reduce high blood pressure in SHR but is also able to counter the development of certain morphological changes often seen in the hypertensive heart and coronary arteries...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} rock wool (RW fibers), we examined the biopersistence of a RW sample in the lungs of rats, based on the changes of fiber number and fiber size in terms of length and width, by a nose-only inhalation exposure study. Twenty male Fischer  344 rats (6 – 10  weeks old) were exposed to RW fibers at a concentration of 70 (21)  fiber/m 3 and 30 (6. 6)  mg/m 3, arithmetic mean (geometric standard deviation), continuously for 3  h daily for five consecutive days. Five rats each were sacrificed shortly and at 1, 2, and 4  weeks after exposure, and their lung tissues were ashed by a low-temperature plasma-asher. Then, the numbers and sizes of fibers in the ashed samples were determined using phase-contrast <b>microscope</b> and computed <b>image</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The fiber numbers in the lungs 4  weeks after exposure significantly decreased from the baseline value, i. e., shortly after exposure (P <  0. 05). The half-lives of RW fibers calculated from the one-compartment model were 32  days for total fibers and 10  days for fibers longer than 20  μm. The decrease of fiber number was 53. 6 % by 4  weeks after exposure (baseline group =  100 %). Likewise, fiber sizes significantly decreased by 4  weeks after exposure (P <  0. 05), probably because fibers were dissolved in body fluid, ingested by alveolar macrophages or discharged to outside of the body by mucociliary movement.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the wear of coated carbide insert in {{machining}} of mild steel. Machineability of mild steel is considered good although the cutting temperature is high. The characteristic of mild steel like high strength, high resistance to breakage and high modulus of elasticity has increased the tool wear of the coated carbide when {{it is used to}} machining the mild steel for long period. As a result, tool wear of the coated carbide inserts in machining of mild steel still need to be improved. The main objective of this project is to examine the progress of tool wear and determine the crater wear and flank wear of the tool in machining the mild steel in turning process. In this project, 33 full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was employed in STATISTICA software to plan and perform the experiment systematically so that any possible experimental error would be minimized. Machining variables considered are cutting length, cutting speed and feed rate. The variables for three levels were 90, 120 and 150 m/min for cutting speed, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/rev for feed rate and 60, 120 and 180 mm for cutting length respectively. Machining of mild steel was carried out by using the conventional lathe machine. After each experiment, flank and crater wear of the coated carbide inserts was investigated and measured by using optical <b>microscope</b> integrated with <b>Image</b> <b>Analyzer.</b> Experimental data was analyzed in STATISTICA. Flank and crater wear curves were then plotted using Minitab software. The result indicates that feed rate is the most significant parameter that influencing both the flank and crater wear compared to cutting speed and cutting length.

Tool wear curves shows that when the number of experiments increases, the flank and crater wear increase monotonically...|$|R
