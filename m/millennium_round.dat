40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} policy {{issues raised by}} regulatory reform in air transport in sub-Saharan Africa. Its basic premise is that improving ait infrastructure {{is of paramount importance}} for the region as it tries to integrate more thoroughly into the world economy. On the basis of the experience of OECD countries with privatisation, liberalisation, and regulatory design, the author analyses progress being made in sub-Saharan Africa and identifies three important case studies: the restructuring of the regional airline of Francophone Western Africa, the sell-off of the state-owned airline of Kenya, and the overall reform process in South Africa, by far the largest market in the sub-continent. The analysis highlights the importance of regional dynamics in the upgrading of the air transport industry in developing and emerging areas. Sub-Saharan Africa has made smaller progress in this respect than, for instance, Central America. As the start of the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> and the first WTO air transport review approach, these issues will gain policy priority for all countries, and may become powerful bargaining tools for non-OECD countries to press for more open access into OECD markets for the South's traditional exports.

40|$|The Uruguay Round has {{established}} completely new rules for agricultural trade, {{but not yet}} achieved much liberalisation. The current new round of negotiations will, therefore, have to make another big step forward. Countries’ views on what exactly should be agreed in the new round still differ widely. However, {{it is remarkable that}} no country has so far doubted the validity of the new WTO rules for agriculture, nor refused to engage in serious negotiations about further reductions. The EU has so far not had major difficulties to honour the new commitments that resulted from the Uruguay Round, though in the area of export subsidies the constraints have already been felt. In the new round of negotiations, EU export subsidies will be a primary target of negotiations, {{given the fact that the}} EU grants around 88 % of all agricultural export subsidies world-wide. It will, therefore, be important for the EU to change its policies such that EU agriculture can export without subsidies. In the cereals sector, Agenda 2000 has made a notable step in this direction.

40|$|The {{impact of}} global {{activism}} against trade liberalization is {{examined in this}} article through {{an analysis of the}} initiatives of cross border civil society networks and with particular attention to the failed 2003 World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Cancun. Key aspects considered here include the internal dynamics of mobilization – which was characterized by a strong framing and widespread protest – and the political opportunities in WTO negotiations, which were marked by divisions within the North and resistance by a large group of Southern governments. In the fail-ure of the WTO <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> in Cancun and the loss of momentum of its liberalization agenda, a significant role has been played by civil society activism and its ability to combine protest, well-prepared lobbying, an epistemic-like community able to influence public opinion, and the development of alliances with like-minded governments of the South. Policy Implications • Developments since the 1999 Seattle WTO ministerial have shown that civil society activism on trade has the ability to slow down trade liberalization. • Global activists should be aware that their campaigns may not be sufficient to prevent trade agreements but, as the events surrounding the 2003 WTO ministerial in Cancun have shown, they can ‘tip ’ the outcome towards failur...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> of the World Trade Organization will be {{critical}} in continuing the process of market expansion begun in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Greater access to international markets {{is important to the}} continued growth and prosperity of U. S. agriculture. Trade growth is considered by some analysts to be crucial as U. S. farm programs change and producers become more dependent on commercial markets to maintain the size and scale of their farm and ranch operations. Some of the most likely areas to be considered for negotiation are: 1. Market Access- TRQ administration, transparency, and guaranteed minimum access will be major issues. Dirty tariffication, methods of tariff reduction, and specific request tariff reductions also will be key issues for market access negotiations. Minimum domestic purchase requirements used by some Latin American countries for grains may emerge as significant impediments to U. S. market access. Beef, pork, poultry, dairy products, grains, fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, sugar, and cotton may be most affected. 2. Export Subsidies- Export subsidy issues will relate to the need to develop a broader and clearer definition of subsidies, the possible inclusion of export credit as an export subsidy, and EU reform of the CAP and its impact on subsidy use.

40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI) and of the WTO <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round,</b> many activists have started again to believe that protest can be successful, even at the highest integration level. This is the first condition of emergence of any social movement. Since Seattle, no important international economic or political forum has 176 taken place without important protests of local, national and international social movements. Each time, a wide range of associations achieved to agree on a common protest: everyone against liberalism. The next step for these movements will be to find out some common alternatives, which will be much more difficult. Therefore, beside street demonstrations, local, national, European and global congresses have been organised in order to promote convergences between components of this wide movement. Far from being against globalisation, the movement takes part in this long-term process of “increasing integration at a planet level”. If it struggles against the present free-market globalisation, this social movement also wants to improve cultural and intellectual exchanges between world citizens. Actually, its first aim is to “globalise the battle”. The movement is also deeply linked to other modernisation process: increasing individuation and rationalisation. All associations are building a civil society network, which is able to divide work and share information as global corporations do.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{itself is}} based on two parts of empirical research. The first-and most extensive-part consists of interviews taken from both Commission officials and officials of the member states responsible for the negotiations on the Uruguay Round. The aim of these interviews was not to conduct research on the substantive issues of these three cases, but rather to help the interviewees to focus their answers to concrete cases, {{rather than to the}} abstract notion of negotiations in general. This was necessary because the questions themselves dealt with {{the way in which the}} respondents perceived their role and the opportunities of their role in both the internal EU decision-making and the external negotiations, and the limits of that role and its opportunities, given the involvement of the other actors (external partners, member state representatives, Commission representatives), and the impact of certain factors (the institutional context of the external negotiations, stages in the negotiating process, politicization of negotiating issues, the constraints of the mandate, etc. The second part of the empirical research was conducted through interviews taken from European Commission negotiators, officials from the Belgian trade administration in the course of February and April 2001, and British trade officials in the course of May and July 2002. Due to time constraints, it only concerns seven Commision officials, three Belgian officials, and seven British officials directly involved in the operation of the Committee 133. The interviews focused on the preparations of the (abortive) attempts to start the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> (1998 - 99) and on the subsequent Commission attempts to reanimate the idea of a round of multilateral trade negotiations in 2001 (Everything but Arms Initiative) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} higher {{education}} in Europe {{in the wake of the}} Bologna Declaration can on the one hand be seen as an effort by the European political world to construct some kind of regional public good in this field. On the other hand the United States and its allies such as Australia and New Zealand are, in the talks of the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round,</b> trying to bring (higher) education under the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This effort reflects the conviction that higher education must be seen as a private good. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the nature {{of higher education}} in terms of the discussion on public good vs private good. Higher education clearly has public as well as private ingredients. A number of questions can be deducted from this fact. This paper will try to give the beginning of an answer to these questions. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the first paragraph a definition is given of international public goods. Higher education is then analysed from the perspective of this definition. The second paragraph considers the European policy towards creating a higher education system in Europe in the framework of a regional public goods approach. Consideration is given to those public and private aspects of higher education which follow from the analysis in paragraph 1. In the third paragraph higher education is set in the framework of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. The fourth paragraph tries to make some concluding remarks about the paradox which is the core issue of this paper...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} {{countries have been}} reluctant to participate in multilateral trade negotiations except for those on agriculture and services, topics mandated under previous World Trade Organization (WTO decisions. The author argues that {{developing countries}} can gain significant benefits from a broader WTO <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> of negotiations but must develop strategies for participating in it. Different groups will have different interests, but developing countries as a group may want to include additional issues in the new Round, especially, industrial tariffs and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. It may also be to their advantage to include discussions on trade-related environmental issues and government procurement, if they obtain the institutional support they need to meet their commitments under any new agreements. Other topics should be resisted because they are premature or counterproductive or do not promise net benefits for most developing countries. The new Round should be a single undertaking, to maximize tradeoffs across issues and for political economy reasons: to permit liberalizing forces everywhere to exert pressure on governments to liberalize world trade. But there should not be too many issues, as that would strain the capacities of the poorer and least developed economies. In a new WTO Round, developing countries should be prepared to exchange liberalizing trade concessions on a most-favored-nation basis. Liberalization of their own trade in exchange for improved access to the markets of their trading partners, most of which are other developing countries, {{is the only way to}} maximize benefits from multilateral trade negotiations. Efforts to obtain special and differential treatment should focus on establishing realistic transition periods and technical assistance to address constraints on their institutional capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT The World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is under}} {{considerable}} fire from nearly every quarter. Undoubtedly, the biggest gun currently belongs to Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch (GTW). GTW is the undisputed {{leader of the}} coalition that derailed the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> of WTO talks in Seattle. In 2004, GTW published a second edition of its book, Whose Trade Organization? {{that had been the}} manifesto of the Seattle protesters. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) {{is one of the most}} frequent target of the anti-WTO crowd (and sometimes the pro-WTO crowd.) One chapter of GTW’s book is reserved for its criticism of the DSB. In this chapter, GTW makes four main arguments. One, that the GATT dispute settlement system was superior to that of the WTO. Two, that the dispute settlement system is rigged against the poor countries. Third, that the WTO dispute settlement system is secret and unaccountable. Fourth, that the DSB panelists and Appellate Body members are incompetent free trade fanatics. The first argument is not true. The GATT system ensured that the most important decisions would never be implemented. The second argument is only true to the extent that any competitive system will favor a party that has more resources with which to compete. The third argument is true, although not nearly to the degree that GTW would have its readers think. The fourth argument is not true. Regardless of their truth, all of GTW’s arguments are converted into counterfactuals to evaluate their desirability. The paper concludes that GTW makes three types of arguments. The first type is based on accurate assertions. The second is based on exaggerated assertions. The third type is based on inaccurate assertions. All of GTW’s counterfactually deduced propositions lead to questionable or undesirable outcomes...|$|E
40|$|For some time, the United States has {{attempted}} to draw labor standards under the umbrella first of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and then the World Trade Organization (WTO). The apparent purpose is to attempt to use the enforcement mechanisms of the GATT, and now the WTO, to improve compliance with what the United States considers to be fair labor standards. Most recently, the United States attempted to place the issue of labor standards on {{the agenda for the}} <b>Millennium</b> <b>Round</b> at the Seattle Ministerial Meeting in 1999. As in the past, President Clinton appeared to seek a joint working party between the WTO and the International Labor Organization (ILO). However, he went further and suggested that the United States might impose sanctions against countries that violated core labor standards. By contrast, during the Singapore Ministerial in 1996, the Clinton Administration claimed that its objective—with regard to labor standards—was only to signal U. S. workers that competition from lowwage countries would not be intensified due to the denial of basic human rights. Administration officials went to some lengths to dispel the view that the United States intended to use trade sanctions to uphold labor standards. The U. S. delegation only sought to link the maintenance of an open world trade system to the promotion of core labor standards and to establish a working party to identify links between labor standards and WTO rules. 1 The United States has had virtually no success with either attempt. The Singapore Ministerial Declaration stated that the ILO was the appropriate body for addressing labor standards internationally. During the Seattle Ministerial, the delegates were unable to agree on any language concerning labor standards...|$|E
