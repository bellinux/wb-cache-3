5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} a state that one entered into by faith at a definite <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Gaia was {{the mother}} of the Titans and {{embodiment}} of Earth. At the request of Zeus' mother Rhea, Gaia raised and protected the young Zeus to prevent Cronos from devouring him, as he had devoured his other children. When Zeus grew to manhood, he betrayed Gaia, freed his siblings, and Gaia was banished with her fellow Titans {{at the conclusion of the}} Great War. In God of War II, she saved Kratos from the Underworld after a disastrous encounter with Zeus, and directed the Spartan to find the Sisters of Fate in order to take revenge on Zeus. A successful Kratos plucked Gaia and the Titans from the <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> before their defeat in the Great War to launch an abortive attack on Olympus. In God of War III, Gaia was wounded in the assault on Olympus and abandoned Kratos, stating he was a pawn of the Titans so that they could have their revenge. Kratos eventually found and crippled Gaia, but she returned and interrupted the final battle between the Spartan and Zeus. The pair entered Gaia's neck wound, and with the Blade of Olympus, Kratos destroyed her heart, killing the Titan.|$|E

His search would eventually result with him traveling through time while seeing Lightning in a dream telling him to protect the crystal pillar holding Cocoon, seeing {{a vision of the}} world's fate, and becoming a l'Cie once more with the Focus of fighting beside Serah at the final battle. Appearing on Cocoon three hundred years in his future, Snow attempts to destroy a monster threatening Cocoon's supporting pillar. Serah and Noel come to Snow's aid and help him defeat it by negating the anomaly causing its growth. With the threat gone, Snow entrusts Noel with Serah's care and dissolves from the <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> while promising Serah that they will meet again. Snow then travels to the Coliseum, a fighting arena separated from the flow of time, and after Serah and Noel challenge him to combat and win, he is forced to remain due to being bound to the Coliseum by the Chaos.|$|E

5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the vagaries of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E

25|$|Bohr was {{the first}} to point out the ‘indivisibility of the quantum of action’, his way of {{describing}} the uncertainty principle, implying that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. For example, the wave–particle duality of physical objects are such complementary phenomena. Both concepts are borrowed from classical mechanics, i.e., measurements such as the double-slit experiment can demonstrate one or the other, but not both phenomena at a particular <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> or position in space. It is impossible to empirically demonstrate both phenomena simultaneously.|$|E

The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E
