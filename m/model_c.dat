40|$|Carbon (C) {{saturation}} {{theory suggests}} that soils have a limited capacity to stabilize organic C and that this capacity may be regulated by intrinsic soil properties such as clay concentration and mineralogy. While C saturation theory has advanced our ability to predict soil C stabilization, few biogeochemical ecosystem <b>models</b> have incorporated <b>C</b> saturation mechanisms. In biogeochemical <b>models,</b> <b>C</b> and nitrogen (N) cycling are tightly coupled, with C decomposition and respiration driving N mineralization. Thus, changing model structures from non-saturation to C saturation dynamics can change simulated N dynamics. In this study, we used <b>C</b> saturation <b>models</b> from the literature and of our own design to compare how different methods of <b>modeling</b> <b>C</b> saturation affected simulated N mineralization dynamics. Specifically, we tested (i) how <b>modeling</b> <b>C</b> saturation by regulating either the transfer efficiency (ε, g C retained g − 1 C respired) or transfer rate (k) of C to stabilized pools affected N mineralization dynamics, (ii) how inclusion of an explicit microbial pool through which C and N must pass affected N mineralization dynamics, and (iii) whether using ε to implement C saturation in a model results in soil texture controls on N mineralization {{that are similar to}} those currently included in widely used non-saturating <b>C</b> and N <b>models.</b> Models were parameterized so that they rendered the same C balance. We found that when <b>C</b> saturation is <b>modeled</b> using ε, the critical C : N ratio for N mineralization from decomposing plant residues (r cr) increases as C saturation of a soil increases. When <b>C</b> saturation is <b>modeled</b> using k, however, r cr is not affected by the C saturation of a soil. Inclusion of an explicit microbial pool in the model structure was necessary to capture short-term N immobilization–mineralization turnover dynamics during decomposition of low N residues. Finally, <b>modeling</b> <b>C</b> saturation by regulating ε led to similar soil texture controls on N mineralization as a widely used non-saturating <b>model,</b> suggesting that <b>C</b> saturation may be a fundamental mechanism that can explain N mineralization patterns across soil texture gradients. These findings indicate that a coupled <b>C</b> and N <b>model</b> that includes saturation can (1) represent short-term N mineralization by including a microbial pool and (2) express the effects of texture on N turnover as an emergent property...|$|R
