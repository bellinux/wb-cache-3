5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
500|$|John Masefield, {{who knew}} Synge, {{wrote that he}} [...] "gave one from the first the {{impression}} of a strange personality". Masefield felt that Synge's view of life originated with his poor health. In particular, Masefield claimed that [...] "His relish of the savagery made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does".|$|E

Hendrix {{was an avid}} fan of Bob Dylan, and especially liked [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". [...] "It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't the only one who'd ever felt so low..." [...] Hendrix said. After the second verse, Hendrix skipped to the fourth. Hendrix played the electric guitar, and music critic Greil Marcus described {{the atmosphere of the}} Hendrix recording thus: ...|$|E

500|$|Kajol {{describes}} herself as being [...] "extremely mischievous" [...] as a child. She added {{that she was very}} stubborn and impulsive from a very young age. Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as [...] "we never argued in front of [...] ". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who [...] "never let <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> my mother was away and working". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her [...] "Maharashtrian pragmatism" [...] from her mother and her [...] "Bengali temperament" [...] from her father.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor's {{originality}} {{has been}} emphasized by several critics writing of her work; thus Lynn Emanuel writes of Captive Voices, [...] "It {{is a complex}} and unexpected convergence of the influences of modernism and a wholly original, native genius. Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> poetry was contemporary and could relate to me right now, in the way that you know that all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E

2500|$|The {{landscape}} of Lewis' native Ireland, in particular Ulster, played {{a large part}} {{in the creation of}} the Narnian landscape. In his essay On Stories, Lewis wrote [...] "I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge". In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide [...] "that part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is my idea of Narnia". Although in adult life Lewis lived in England, he returned to Northern Ireland often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery, saying [...] "I yearn to see County Down in the snow; one almost expects to see a march of dwarfs dashing past. How I long to break into a world where such things were true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the murder}} of Virgil Starks nine weeks later, Hollis and Larey {{declared}} that their attacker was the same person who killed the other five victims. Hollis said, [...] "I think {{the man is a}} young white man; under thirty years old." [...] He also stated, [...] "I know he's crazy. The crazy things he said made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> his mind was warped," [...] and [...] "Evidently he thought he had killed me that night. Right after it happened, I told the deputy sheriff and the city attorney that that man was dangerous. He is a potential murderer. The next person he gets will be killed. It wasn't long after that when the first two bodies were found out on West Seventh street. I think there are three people alive today who escaped from that man. The woman who is in the hospital now , Mrs. Larey and I." ...|$|E
2500|$|Texas Ranger Captain Gonzaullas {{was said}} to have stated that he and {{officers}} were dealing with a [...] "shrewd criminal who had left no stone unturned to conceal his identity and activities," [...] and that his efforts were both clever and baffling. He also stated the man he was hunting was a [...] "cunning individual who would go to all lengths to avoid apprehension." [...] After the murder of Virgil Starks, the majority of the 47 officers unofficially believed that the killer's motives were that of [...] "sex mania". One of the officers stated, [...] "I believe that a sex pervert is responsible." [...] The headline of the May 5, 1946 edition of the Texarkana Gazette read [...] "SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS". At the murder scene of Virgil Starks, Bowie County Sheriff William [...] "Bill" [...] H. Presley said, [...] "This killer is the luckiest person I have ever known. No one sees him, hears him in time, or can identify him in any way." [...] Officers have said that the killer is apparently a maniac who is an expert with a gun. Victim and survivor Jimmy Hollis said, [...] "I know he's crazy. The crazy things he said made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> his mind was warped." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> certain <b>that</b> the Indians don't {{intend to}} attack us until dark. Perhaps father heard some of their powwowing, or some talk between them and Stiger. Anyway, I am sure he is going away." ...|$|R
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the only}} person capable of {{controlling}} Puyi, Johnston had much more influence than his title of English tutor would suggest as the eunuchs began to rely upon Johnston to steer Puyi away from his more capricious moods. When the 14 year-old Puyi had some western-style clothing purchased to wear from a theater company, Johnston flew into a rage, saying that Puyi was wearing cheap clothing unworthy of an emperor, and had Puyi buy expensive clothes from a western-style department store, telling Puyi [...] "If you wear clothes from a second-hand shop, you won't be a gentleman, you'll be..." [...] with Puyi noting {{he was unable to}} finish his sentence. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi started to insist that his eunuchs address him as [...] "Henry" [...] and later his wife Wanrong as [...] "Elizabeth" [...] as Puyi began to speak [...] "Chinglish"-a mixture of Mandarin and English that was to be his preferred model of speech. Puyi recalled about Johnston: [...] "I thought everything about him was first-rate. He made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Westerners were the most intelligent and civilized people in the world and that he was the most learned of Westerners" [...] and that [...] "Johnston had become the major part of my soul". In May 1919, Puyi noticed the protests in Beijing generated by the May 4th movement as thousands of Chinese university students protested against the decision by the great powers at the Paris peace conference to award the former German concessions in Shangdong province together with the former German colony of Qingdao to Japan. For Puyi, the May 4th movement, which he asked Johnston about, was a revelation as it marked {{the first time in his}} life that he noticed that people outside the Forbidden City had concerns that were not about him.|$|E
