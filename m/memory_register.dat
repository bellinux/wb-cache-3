5|$|The {{design by}} John Pemberton won a Design Council award, {{and there are}} {{examples}} of the Sovereign in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It had a Mostek MK50321N main integrated circuit and a small <b>memory</b> <b>register,</b> a LED display, and could perform a variety {{of a number of}} basic mathematical operations besides four-function arithmetic.|$|E
5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] key {{allows for}} indirection: {{wherever}} {{a reference to}} a <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> or a program location is allowed, this key can be used to fetch the actual value from a <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b> For example, the key sequence [...] means to fetch the value in <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> 10, and use that value in turn as the number of a <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> whose contents are to be fetched as the current operand. However, in this case the [...] cannot be encoded as code 40, because the code sequence 43 40 would be interpreted as [...] , not [...]|$|E
50|$|The FX-501P could store 128 steps, with 11 <b>memory</b> <b>registers.</b> The FX-502P {{had twice}} that {{capacity}} with 256 steps and 22 <b>memory</b> <b>registers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>registers</b> were {{increased}} to 7. For statistic or constant entry, an expression has maximum 47 characters.|$|R
5000|$|HP-45 â€” Improved {{version of}} the HP-35 with 10 <b>memory</b> <b>registers,</b> extra {{functions}} and display format selection.|$|R
50|$|There are 2 operand {{registers}} (a, b) and 1 <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b>|$|E
5000|$|M: <b>Memory</b> <b>Register</b> (18 bit), holds {{data that}} are being {{transferred}} between the central computer and memory ...|$|E
5000|$|The FX-601P could store 128 fully merged {{steps and}} data could {{be stored in}} 11 <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b> The memory of the FX-602P could be {{partitioned}} between from 32 to 512 fully merged steps and data could be stored in 22 to 88 <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b> The default set-up was 22 register and 512 steps. From there one could trade 8 steps for one additional register or 80 steps for 11 register with the 11th register begin a so-called [...] "F" [...] register.|$|E
50|$|The core runs eight threads concurrently. These threads can {{communicate}} and synchronise using <b>memory,</b> <b>registers,</b> channels, locks, or synchronisers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{memory in}} the HP 35s is also usable for data storage, {{in the form}} of an extra 801 {{numbered}} <b>memory</b> <b>registers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Memory</b> Address <b>Register</b> is half of {{a minimal}} {{interface}} between a microprogram and computer storage. The other half is a <b>memory</b> data <b>register.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Indirect branching, {{which allows}} the {{contents}} of a <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> to be used as the target of a branching instruction (GTO or XEQ) is omitted from the HP 35s.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{the correct}} {{terminology}} is clear - A delay between a physical input occurring (e.g., I/O pin voltage change) and it being processed electronically (I/O pins read by processor and memory registers updated {{to reflect the}} state of the pins) is input lag, and a delay between an electronic output being sent (e.g., <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> set to reflect the desired state of an output) and it being processed into a physically observable phenomenon (e.g., <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> read and I/O pin voltage modified accordingly), is output lag. In short, Input Lag occurs on input devices, Output Lag occurs on output devices.|$|E
50|$|EL-735 {{displays}} 9-digit mantissa {{in scientific}} display mode. There is only 1 <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b> Functions include Cost/Sell Margin, Compound Interest, Amortisation of Payment, Bond Calculation, 360-Day Calendar, Non-Uniform Cash Flow, Constant Calculation, Chain Calculation, 1-Var./2-Var. Statistics, Date Calculation, Database, Sign Change, Right Shift. It {{is powered by}} 1 CR2016 battery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Memory</b> Data <b>Register</b> is half of {{a minimal}} {{interface}} between a microprogram and computer storage, the other half is a <b>memory</b> address <b>register</b> (MAR).|$|R
50|$|This is {{a sample}} program which computes the {{factorial}} of an input integer number (ignoring the calculator's built-in factorial function). The program consumes 18 bytes. No <b>memory</b> <b>registers</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|A set of <b>memory</b> map <b>registers</b> {{is used to}} map virtual {{addresses}} to physical. There {{are eight}} <b>memory</b> map <b>registers,</b> each mapping 2K words, to provide an address space of 16K.|$|R
50|$|Leading zeros {{also present}} {{whenever}} {{the number of}} digits is technically fixed (such as in a <b>memory</b> <b>register),</b> but the stored value is not large enough {{to result in a}} non-zero most significant digit. The count leading zeros operation efficiently determines the number of leading zero bits in a machine word.|$|E
5000|$|The FX-603P could store 6,144 steps. Data {{could be}} stored in 110 <b>memory</b> <b>register.</b> The FX-603P series {{supported}} 20 labels for programs and subroutines called P0 [...]. P19 - twice {{the amount of the}} predecessor models. Each program or subroutine could have up to 10 local labels called LBL0 [...]. LBL9 for jumps and branches.|$|E

5000|$|Intel {{states the}} Gainestown {{processors}} have six memory channels. Gainestown processors have dual QPI links {{and have a}} separate set of <b>memory</b> <b>registers</b> for each link in effect, a multiplexed six-channel system.|$|R
50|$|The HP-20S (F1890A) is an {{algebraic}} programmable, {{member of}} Pioneer series of HP calculators produced from 1988 to 2003. It {{is similar to}} HP-21S. It has ninety-nine steps of fully merged program and ten <b>memory</b> <b>registers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The MK-61 has 105 {{steps of}} {{volatile}} program memory and 15 <b>memory</b> <b>registers.</b> It functions using either three AA-size battery cells or a wall plug. It has a ten-digit (eight digit mantissa, two digit exponent) green vacuum fluorescent display.|$|R

If the encoders C1 and C2 are used respectively in n1 and n2 iterations, their rates are respectively equal to ...|$|E
50|$|The Cambridge Programmable (sold in the U.S as the Radio Shack EC-4001) was {{released}} in 1975. It lacked accuracy in many of its scientific functions, some yielding only four significant digits. It featured a single <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> and a limit of 36 program steps, along with a conditional jump instruction. The Programmable came with a program library consisting of 4 books, covering general functions, finance & statistics, mathematics, physics & engineering and electronics.|$|E
50|$|EL-500M is {{a single}} line version of EL-509W, which {{contains}} only the dot matrix line. Dot matrix line only shows 11 characters. <b>Memory</b> <b>register</b> is reduced from 9 to 1. Removed functions include engineering unit display mode, cubic root/power, hyperbolic trigonometry, random dice, random coin, random integer, angle unit conversion, polar/cartesian coordinate conversion, multi-line playback, binary/pental/octal/hexadecimal calculations, 2-variable statistics, 2-key roll-over. However, it adds reduction study, highest common factor/lowest common multiple, quotient/remainder calculation. Total function is 131. The keyboard is not plastic like {{the others in the}} lineup.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{distinction}} between <b>memory</b> space and <b>register</b> space because the RAM serves the job of both <b>memory</b> and <b>registers,</b> and the RAM is usually just {{referred to as the}} register file or simply as the registers.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} {{relies on}} concepts that have existed {{since the beginning}} of the computer era: <b>memory,</b> <b>registers</b> and basic instructions without secondary features often introduced to improve the execution performance. The performance is of secondary concern as the UVC programs are run mostly to restore the data and not work with them.|$|R
50|$|The PDP-11 {{processor}} architecture has {{a mostly}} orthogonal instruction set. For example, instead of instructions such as load and store, the PDP-11 has a move instruction for which either operand (source and destination) can be memory or register. There are no specific input or output instructions; the PDP-11 uses memory-mapped I/O {{and so the}} same move instruction is used; orthogonality even enables moving data directly from an input device to an output device. More complex instructions such as add likewise can have <b>memory,</b> <b>register,</b> input, or output as source or destination.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 Tezzaron Semiconductor built working 3D devices {{from six}} {{different}} designs. [...] The chips {{were built in}} two layers with [...] "via-first" [...] tungsten TSVs for vertical interconnection. Two wafers were stacked face-to-face and bonded with a copper process. The top wafer was thinned and the two-wafer stack was then diced into chips. The first chip tested was a simple <b>memory</b> <b>register,</b> but the most notable of the set was an 8051 processor/memory stack that exhibited much higher speed and lower power consumption than an analogous 2D assembly.|$|E
5000|$|These TI calculators {{allowed for}} {{addressing}} up to 100 data memory locations, numbered 00 to 99 (some models {{had a lower}} limit than this). A keystroke sequence like [...] (store the currently-displayed number into memory 42) would be encoded as 42 42. In this case the first 42 is the key code for the [...] key, but the second 42 is not a key code, but a <b>memory</b> <b>register</b> number. The calculator knows to interpret it as such because thatâ€™s what has to follow the code for the [...] key.|$|E
50|$|However, {{exploiting}} the computer-like {{capabilities of the}} TI-59 is a different matter. Although the TI-59 is Turing-complete, supporting straight-line programming, conditions, loops, and indirect access to <b>memory</b> <b>registers,</b> and although it supports limited alphanumeric output on the printer only, writing sophisticated routines is essentially a matter of planning machine language and using a coding pad.|$|R
30|$|A RAM {{consists}} of an infinite set of <b>memory</b> <b>registers</b> that are used by a finite program. To better match the real implementations in this paper, a large but finite number of registers will be used instead of an infinite number. Each register can hold an integer. Register i is denoted Xi for a nonnegative integer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Memory</b> Data <b>Register</b> (MDR) or <b>Memory</b> Buffer <b>Register</b> (MBR) is the {{register}} of a computer's control unit {{that contains the}} data to be stored in the computer storage (e.g. RAM), or the data after a fetch from the computer storage. It acts like a buffer and holds anything that is copied from the memory ready for the processor to use it.|$|R
