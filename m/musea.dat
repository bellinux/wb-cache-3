50|$|The order, {{which now}} has more than 2,600 species, {{distributed}} in 68 genera over eight families, has been subdivided from early times. In the Bentham and Hooker system (1883), their Ordo Scitamineae had four tribes: Zingibereae, Maranteae, Canneae, and <b>Museae.</b> These have become progressively divided to form the modern phyletic classification into the following monophyletic families: Zingiberaceae (gingers), Musaceae (bananas), Heliconiaceae (heliconias), Strelitziaceae (bird-of-paradise), Costaceae (spiral gingers), Cannaceae (canna lilies), Marantaceae (prayer plants), and Lowiaceae (Orchidantha). The APG II system (2003) provided a classification of families for the first time, retaining Kress' eight families.|$|R

[...] The second, Home, features Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper and was also a limited edition (2003). The other two have been slated for release on <b>Musea’s</b> sub-label Gazul sometime in the near future. [...] Meanwhile, Jeff continues to compose and record, when he’s not busy with Glass, and even create some videos for his pieces.On the July 23, 2010, Jeff and his brother Greg signed licensing agreements with Muzak which will allow Muzak to use their original recordings in their programs worldwide. This will include not only Glass music but music from all their solo projects as well.|$|R
25|$|Thunberg {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Jönköping, Sweden. At the age of 18, he entered the Swedish Uppsala University where he was taught by the famous Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus who was mainly known for his work Philosophia Botanica (1751). Thunberg graduated in 1767 after only 6 years of studying. To deepen his knowledge in botany, medicine and natural history, he was encouraged by Linnaeus in 1770 to travel to Paris and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam and Leiden where he stayed to study the city's collection of plants and <b>musea,</b> Thunberg met the Dutch botanist and physician, Johannes Burman and his son Nicolaas Burman who himself had been a disciple of Linnaeus.|$|E

Already in July 1898, the front of probably the same animal had been bought, BMNH P.11823. On 22 July 1905 specimen BMNH P.10156 was acquired, a gill basket. In January 1915 Leeds sold specimens GLAHM V3362, a pectoral fin, and GLAHM V3363, {{the remainder of the}} same skeleton with 904 elements, to the Hunterian Museum of Glasgow.|$|E

He continued to write poetry and under his leadership, the number {{of members of the}} Czech-Slav Society continuously increased. In this year, a poem of Štúr's was published in printed form for the first time: Óda na Hronku ("An ode to Hronka"). In April 1837, the Czech-Slav Society was banned due to a commotion between students at the Lýceum. One week later, Štúr founded the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature, within which the activities of the Czech-Slav Society continued. In that year, he continued to write articles for newspapers and journals, including Tatranka, Hronka, Květy (Czech), Časopis českého <b>musea,</b> Danica (Croatian) and Tygodnik literacki (Polish).|$|E
40|$|For certain {{maritime}} operations {{there is}} an increasing demand for knowldedge about the co-existence of different wave systems. Design practices have shown that reliable directional data allow cost optimization in offshore facilities by reducing the inconsistencies in design criteria due to omni-directional approaches. The main goal for this dissertation {{is to improve the}} traditional assessment of wave climates by introducing wind sea and swell systems as regular components. Three independent datasets for a location on the Belgian Continental Shelf has been extensively examined during the period 1999 - 2008. The first dataset consists of buoy measurement records. The other two datasests are two wave model hindcasts, the ERA-INTERIM re-analysis from ECMWF {{on the one hand and}} in house simulations using the SWAN wave model on the other hand. Careful pre-processing was carried out to have a homogeneous dataset. The development of a wave partitioning scheme is considered a main achievement. The <b>MuSeas</b> toolbox has been built in Matlab environment and has proven to be a reliable and flexible tool for analyzing multiple seas. In particular, effort has been made to obtain an analysis routine capable of dealing with different type of input and formats and with a high degree of automatization. An inter-comparison between datasets and wave components for the mean climate was carried out to have a measure of the interchangeability between observations and model results. The hindcasts showed satisfactory representations of the total and of the wind sea component, but it was not so adequate for the swell component. Multivariate analysis for the partitioned spectra was carried out for the mean wave climate. A novel approach visualizes multiple wave systems by way of mosaic plots derived from contingency tables. These plots display characteristic patterns of wind sea and swell systems for a specific location. Another practical application deals with combinations of multiple seas that are considered hazardous for maritime navigation as in the case of crossing seas. Also the extreme behavior of wind sea and swell wave components was investigated both from a stationary and non-stationary point of view. Stationary modeling assumes that the distribution parameters remain constant over time, whereas the non-stationary model involves also the seasonal fluctuations. And finally the effects due to gaps in the data time series and due to directionality are investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
6000|$|In autumn {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} to see flies motionless upon a window-pane, with a sort of magic circle, in white, drawn round them. On microscopic examination, the magic circle is found to consist of innumerable spores, which have been thrown off in all directions by a minute fungus called Empusa <b>museæ</b> the spore-forming filaments of which stand out like a pile of velvet from the body of the fly. These spore-forming filaments are connected with others which fill the interior of the fly's body like so much fine wool, having eaten away and destroyed the creature's viscera. This is the full-grown condition of the Empusa. If traced back to its earliest stages, in flies which are still active, and to all appearance healthy, it is found to exist in the form of minute corpuscles which float in the blood of the fly. These multiply and lengthen into filaments, at the expense of the fly's substance; and when they have at last killed the patient, they grow out of its body and give off spores. Healthy flies shut up with diseased ones catch this mortal disease, and perish like the others. A most competent observer, M. Cohn, who studied the development of the Empusa very carefully, was utterly unable to discover in what manner the smallest germs of the Empusa got into the fly. The spores could not be made to give rise to such germs by cultivation; nor were such germs discoverable in the air, or in the food of the fly. It looked exceedingly like a case of Abiogenesis, or, at any rate, of Xenogenesis; and it is only quite recently that the real course of events has been made out. It has been ascertained that when one of the spores falls upon the body of a fly, it begins to germinate, and sends out a process which bores its way through the fly's skin; this, having reached the interior cavities of its body, gives off the minute floating corpuscles which are the earliest stage of the Empusa. The disease is [...] "contagious", because a healthy fly coming in contact with a diseased one, from which the spore-bearing filaments protrude, is pretty sure to carry off a spore or two. It is [...] "infectious" [...] because the spores become scattered about all sorts of matter m the neighbourhood of the slain flies. Silkworms are liable to many diseases; and, even before 1853, a peculiar epizootic, frequently accompanied by the appearance of dark spots upon the skin (whence the name of [...] "Pébrine" [...] which it has received), had been noted for its mortality. But in the years following 1853 this malady broke out with such extreme violence, that, in 1858, the silk-crop was reduced to a third of the amount which it had reached in 1853; and, up till within the last year or two, it has never attained half the yield of 1853. This means not only that the great number of people engaged in silk growing are some thirty millions sterling poorer than they might have been; it means not only that high prices have had to be paid for imported silkworm eggs, and that, after investing his money in them, in paying for mulberry-leaves and for attendance, the cultivator has constantly seen his silkworms perish and himself plunged in ruin; but it means that the looms of Lyons have lacked employment, and that, for years, enforced idleness and misery have been the portion of a vast population which, in former days, was industrious and well-to-do.|$|R

Also during this period, his poetic cycle Dumky večerní ("Evening Thoughts", written in Czech) was published in the Czech journal Květy. He left Pressburg for Halle in September 1838. On his way to Halle, he spent more than a month in Prague, in the company of Czech patriots. In the spring of 1839, Štúr made a long journey to the Upper and Lower Lusatia in Germany (inhabited by Slavs) and got in touch with the Slavs there. He wrote the short travelogue Cesta do Lužic vykonaná na jar 1839 ("A journey to Lusatia made in the spring of 1839"), written in Czech and published in the Czech journal Časopis českého <b>musea.</b>|$|E
