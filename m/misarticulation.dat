40|$|Background: Visual {{biofeedback}} using electropalatography (EPG) {{has been}} beneficial {{in the treatment}} of some cases of lateral /s/ <b>misarticulation.</b> While EPG intervention is motorically based, studies have not commonly employed a motor learning approach to treatment. Furthermore, treatment success is measured primarily by change to EPG tongue-palate contact patterns and listener ratings conducted by speech-language therapists. Studies have not commonly measured articulatory change without the palate in-situ using acoustic analysis and non-professional listeners. Aims: To determine if an intensive treatment programme including both visual biofeedback (EPG) and traditional articulation techniques within a motor learning paradigm would result in functional improvement to /s/ articulation in an 11 -year-old girl with persistent lateral <b>misarticulation.</b> Methods & Procedures: Treatment involved 12 sessions of therapist-delivered treatment over 4 weeks followed by a 6 -week home programme.

40|$|Background: The {{challenge}} in palatoplasty {{is no longer}} a successful closure of the cleft palate but an optimal speech outcome without compromising maxillofacial growth. On the contrary, repairing cleft palate as soon as possible is recommended to improve speech. The surgeon proposed two-stage palatoplasty in early aged, range between 4 to 30 months. The delayed hard palate closure started approximately between the age of three years and one year after soft palatoplasty to avoid temporary retracted oral articulation of certain consonant. Patient and Methods: 11 -months old and 9 -months old patients with non-syndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate had undergone soft palatoplasty. Speech was examined as a perceptual assessment, using protocol in Craniomaxillofacial Center Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, in the age of 29 months by an experienced speech pathologist. Result: Patient 1 has mild hypernasality, adequate velopharyngeal competence, normal articulation pattern, phonation and speech intelligibility. Patient 2 has <b>misarticulation</b> pattern,which are omission or weak consonants, substitution of pharyngeal stop, mild to moderate hypernasality, mild impairment in speech intelligibility, and inadequate velopharyngeal competence.

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examined}} associations between articulatory speech disorders and occlusal anomalies {{found in a}} group of young Finnish-speaking adults. The present results indicate that mesial molar occlusion, mandibular overjet and to some extent lateral crossbite, seem to be associated with <b>misarticulation</b> of some medio-alveolar consonants. The incorrectly pronounced sounds are produced too anteriorly. Despite differences in the /s/ phoneme in different languages, an association between an anterior open bite and a laterally or too anteriorly produced unvoiced /s / sound seems to be uniform in different languages.

40|$|Abstract Background Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{a viable}} surgical treatment method for Parkinson’s disease (PD). It has positive effects on the classical motor symptoms, but effects on speech and voice are not equally beneficial. The speech disorder related to PD is hypokinetic dysarthria, with impaired articulatory precision as a prominent symptom. Studies have shown effects on different aspects of speech due to DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) but the effects of stimulation of the caudal zona incerta (cZi) are less explored. Aims The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the effect of STN-DBS and cZi-DBS on perceptually measured articulatory precision in PD patients. Method Read speech productions were collected from 19 DBS-treated PD patients, ten STN and nine cZi. The recordings were made before surgery and 12 months postoperatively with stimulator on and off. Levodopa medication was always on. From the reading passage, three-syllable words were selected and isolated. Articulatory precision of the words was rated in two different assessments; an overall rating of articulatory precision and an identification of occurring misarticulations. Results The results from the perceptual assessment showed a decrease in articulatory precision after surgery for both groups. The decrease was significant for the cZi group, but not for the STN group. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups. The frequency of observed misarticulations increased as an effect of DBS for both patient groups, with significant increase for the STN group but not for the cZi group. There was no significant difference between the groups. The most commonly observed <b>misarticulation</b> categories were stop-plosive reduced in quality, fricative realized as other fricative and stop-plosive realized as fricative. Conclusions The results obtained in the current study show that STN-DBS and cZi-DBS may have adverse effects on articulatory precision in PD patients.

Linguistic diversity is increasing in the patients seen for cleft palate treatment {{and there are}} not enough providers who speak multiple languages. There are no published studies which directly investigate the ability to assess cleft palate articulation and resonance in a language not spoken by the examiner. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether listeners could make accurate judgments about articulation and resonance in languages they do not speak and to determine how experience level and familiarity with a language affect these ratings. Binary (presence/absence) and visual analog scale (VAS) judgments were obtained for hypernasality, <b>misarticulations,</b> speech acceptability, and overall velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) of English, Spanish, and Hmong samples from naïve listeners, generalist speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and specialist SLPs. The speech samples were obtained from 22 speakers, nine with a history of VPD and 13 controls. The ratings were completed by 24 native English listeners, eight at each level of experience (naïve, generalist SLP, specialist SLP). Overall, the listeners were more accurate for determining the presence/absence of <b>misarticulations,</b> speech acceptability, and VPD in English compared to Hmong. Hypernasality and VPD ratings in English were more accurate than in Spanish and ratings of <b>misarticulations</b> were more accurate in Spanish than Hmong. VAS ratings of hypernasality were highly correlated with the nasalance values from oral phoneme reading passages. Statistically significant correlations were present for overall and group ratings in English. Less consistent correlations were observed in Spanish and no significant correlations were present in Hmong. Overall, listeners judged English ratings to be easier to make, and were made with more confidence, compared to Hmong. Overall, the SLP specialists tended to find the ratings in all languages easier to make and were more confident than naïve listeners. Many of the expected differences for ratings based on listener experience and language familiarity were observed. There were advantages for all listener groups in English when compared to Hmong. These differences were inconsistent and weaker when Spanish was compared to English. The experience advantage for listeners was most apparent in English and Hmong...|$|R

Procedure: The overall grade of severity, hypernasality, audible nasal emission, <b>misarticulations,</b> and intelligibility were rated on visual analog scales. Speech samples with a normal distribution of phonemes (normal text [NT]) and those free of nasal consonants (denasal text [DT]) of 43 patients with VPI were used. Mean nasalance scores were computed for the speech samples, and Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between the mean nasalance score and the five parameters of the differentiated rating. Setting: The Institute of Phoniatrics, Utrecht University Hospital, The Netherlands. Results: The correlation coefficient between the mean nasalance and the perceptual rating of hypernasality ranged among judges from. 31 to. 56 for NT speech samples and. 36 to. 60 for DT speech samples.

40|$|Over {{the years}} {{a great deal}} of {{research}} on the perception and production of foreign ac-cent has focused mainly on segments <b>misarticulation</b> by L 2 speakers and on the phonological transfer from L 1 to L 2. Nevertheless, increasing attention has been recently paid to the contribution of prosody in the perception of foreign accent. In light of this renewed interest, the present research aimed to identify the suprasegmental features that make Chinese accented-Italian perceptively deviating from Italian native speech. In addition it focused on Italian listeners’ reaction times to foreign accent. To the purpose, 16 Chinese learners of L 2 Italian, aged between 18 - 22, with an inter-mediate level of linguistic competence and 2 Italian native speakers were recorded while reading a 50 -word text. After that, 56 Italian listeners were asked to rate the degree of accentedness of every speaker using a four-point scale (0 = no accent; 1 = mild accent; 2 = strong accent; 3 =very strong accent). Spectro-acoustic analysis was conducted on the cor-pus of L 1 -L 2 Italian and the following rhythmic-prosodic parameters were calculated: ar-ticulation rate speech rate, fluency, tonal range, percentage of silence, mean duration of si-lent pauses. The comparison between the spectro-acoustic analysis and the results of the perception test showed that fluency, tonal range, percentage of silence and disfluences are relevant parameters to differentiate the degree of accentedness. The heavier the accent the lower the tonal range and the fluency and the higher the percentage of silence and disfluencies. As for the listeners’ reaction times to foreign accent, a second perception test, based on the same corpus of the first test was administered to different native listeners who were not familiar with Chinese-accented Italian. The results showed that 5 seconds (on average) are needed to detect the speaker’s provenience. Native listeners instead take longer - more than 10 seconds - to rate the degree of foreign accentedness...|$|E

50|$|Often a palatal {{obturator}} is {{used because}} a palatal fistula can affect development and proper articulation. As fistula sizes vary, small fistulae tend {{to result in}} little to no speech alterations whereas large fistulae tend to result in audible nasal emissions and weak pressure with and/or without hypernasality. <b>Misarticulations,</b> abnormal nasal resonance and nasal escape or air often results from the problem. Fistulae may decrease intraoral air pressure during production of oral pressure consonants causing distortion of sounds as well as increase in nasal airflow. It is common for an individual with a fistula to compensate for a loss of pressure during speech sound production by attempting to regulate intraoral air pressure with increasing respiration effort and using compensatory articulation. Middorsum palatal stops (atypical place of articulation) often results from palatal fistulae causing sound distortions during speech. Occlusion for the fistula is attempted by speakers with deviant tongue placements during these palatal stops.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAge-typical <b>misarticulations</b> in phonological {{development}} that are attested {{in any given}} language might be explained by universal "markedness constraints" or by language-specific "phonotactic constraints". The present study examines Drehu (an Austronesian language spoken in New Caledonia) and French developmental data on [k] and [t] in different vowel contexts. The study of growth in accuracy by age for word-initial [k] and [t] in 3 vowel contexts shows that both stops are mastered early in both languages, but [k] is somewhat more accurate for the youngest children. In addition, the difference in accuracy is modulated by vowel context. The greater accuracy of [k] before [u] in Drehu {{is in keeping with}} the intrinsic difficulty of producing coronal constrictions before back vowels described in the frame/content account of markedness universals based on the mandibular cycle. The greater accuracy of [k] before [i] in French, on the other hand, is unexpected. The relationship between mean accuracy of [k] or [t] and CV frequencies derived from two corpora of child-directed speech was examined for the youngest children. The otherwise puzzling effects of the front-vowel context on accuracy of [t] seem to reflect the very low frequency of the [ti] sequence in both languages.

40|$|Cleft of the lip, the {{alveolar}} {{process and}} the palate (CLP) {{is the most common}} congenital malformation of the head. Whereas the cleft lip is a malformation that affects aesthetics, cleft palate is a malformation that affects function. Functional disorders due to a palatal cleft include problems of nutrition, swallowing, breathing and grimacing. Moreover, speech and voice quality are commonly affected. Speech and voice disorders may persist after repair of the palatal cleft. Speech is primarily affected by hypernasality or increased nasal resonance as well as nasal air escape, and secondarily by <b>misarticulations,</b> decreased intelligibility and hoarseness. Hypernasality and nasal air escape are commonly treated by surgery, while <b>misarticulations</b> and hoarseness are treated by speech therapy. The superiorly based posterior pharyngeal wall flap with a Z-plasty to cover the wound surface of the flap is one of the surgical techniques {{that can be used to}} treat hypernasality in speech due to velopharyngeal insufficiency. Velopharyngeal insufficiency occurs when the soft palate is unable to separate the oropharynx from the nasopharynx. Hypernasality is one of the parameters that may influence intelligibility of speech. As speech is the cornerstone of social integration and peer acceptance, the ultimate goal of the flap operation is to obtain speech with a normal nasal resonance and with a pleasing quality. However, if after pharyngeal flap surgery speech outcome with regard to hypernasality is disappointing, revisional surgery is usually performed in order to obtain a more favourable outcome. The incidence of revisional surgery may be used as a measure to describe speech outcome after pharyngeal flap surgery. To assess speech before and after pharyngeal flap surgery, as well perceptual judgment as instrumental measures can be performed. In clinical situation, the perceptual impression is the first tool used to judge the severity of the abnormalities in speech before and after therapy. For scientific reasons it is important to know the reliability of the perceptual judgment. Unfortunately, the current research points out that the reliability of this perceptual judgment is only moderate. For a more objective support for diagnosis and decision making for therapy, instruments to measure hypernasality in speech have been developed. One of these instruments is the Nasometer®. The nasometer claims to provide measures which are based on physiology. During standardized speech, nasal acoustic energy is measured separately from oral acoustic energy. The ratio of acoustic energy proceeding from the nasal cavity and the total acoustic energy is used as a measure for nasal resonance. The correlation between the perceptual judgment and the instrumental measure is an important issue. From the current research appears that the correlation between perception and nasometry is only moderate, probably meaning that measurement by nasometry and judgment by perception reflects different dimensions of speech. Therefore, acoustic nasometry must not be considered as a substitute for the perceptual judgment, but as a tool to quantify nasal resonance before and after therapy as part of a multidimensional diagnostic process (beside aerodynamics, imaging and self-evaluation) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this pilot}} study, the reliabilities of the perceptual ratings of {{four types of}} speech samples by six judges, with and without {{expertise}} in evaluating cleft palate speech, were studied. Pre- and postoperative tape recordings of 15 patients with cleft lip and palate who had undergone a superiorly based pharyngeal flap operation were selected. Five speech-language pathologists and one oral and maxillofacial surgeon perceptually rated the following variables on separate 100 -mm visual analog scales: hypernasality, audible nasal emission, intelligibility, <b>misarticulations</b> associated with velopharyngeal insufficiency, voice quality, and {{the presence or absence}} of hyponasality. These six variables were rated in four types of speech samples: reading of three sentences, repeating after the speech pathologist of three sentences, 10 sentences containing the aforementioned material, and the same 10 sentences in paired comparison. All speech samples were rerated after 3 months by the same judges. Judges differed largely in the range they used in their rating. Intrajudge reliability of. 56 to. 78 was found for ratings of hypernasality. No significant differences in intrajudge reliability were found for the ratings with the different types of speech samples. The intrajudge reliability of a judge with expertise was not necessarily higher than of a judge without this expertise. The improvement in speech is most reliably assessed with speech samples in paired comparison. A speech-language pathologist with expertise in evaluating cleft palate speech does not guarantee a high intrajudge reliability of the ratin...|$|R
40|$|In {{mainland}} China, around 20, 000 {{infants with}} non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate are born every year. There {{is a great}} clinical need for the rigorous investigation of the speech problems in this population. This thesis aimed to investigate the consonant <b>misarticulations</b> in native Putonghua speakers with repaired cleft palate based on a research project comprised of four studies. <b>Misarticulations</b> associated with cleft palate are well established for English and several other Indo-European languages. However, few research articles describing the articulation of Putonghua (standard Mandarin Chinese) speakers with cleft palate {{have been published in}} English language journals. Study One reviewed relevant studies published over the past 30 years in Chinese language journals. Thirty-seven articles were analyzed and coded on a number of methodological variables. This critical review identified many methodological issues. These design flaws made it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about characteristic articulation errors. Seeing the methodological shortcomings found in Study One, a cross-sectional approach was used in Study Two to identify common consonant error patterns. Thirty-two speakers with repaired cleft palate were allocated to four groups dependent on age and the type of cleft. Articulation was evaluated based on the Putonghua Segmental Phonology Test and the Deep Test for Cleft Palate Speakers in Putonghua. The data were transcribed using International Phonetic Alphabet conventions by two experienced examiners. Several ‘language universal’ findings were identified. In addition, distinctive features in Putonghua phonology appeared to contribute to the observed language specific error patterns. The following two studies focused on the particularly vulnerable manner of articulation: affricates. The results from Study Three showed that distorted affricates from speakers with repaired cleft palate exhibited distinctive spectral features compared to typical articulation. These spectral findings added objective evidence to support the articulation deviation noted in Study Two. Study Four examined the relationship between spectral moments and perceptual judgment of accuracy for the place of affricate and to explore whether listeners relied on different spectral moments to perceive place of articulation. Both typical and distorted affricates were played to twelve listeners to make a judgment of articulation accuracy using visual analog scaling. Results showed that the third spectral moment (L 3) was significantly correlated with perceptual rating of accuracy of place information from typical speakers. For affricates produced by speakers with cleft palate, the first moment (M 1) showed a significantly correlation with perceptual judgment of the accuracy of alveolar affricates. Recommendations concerning methodological issues in the perceptual investigation of cleft palate speech were given in the systematic review. For the first time, the speech error study demonstrated the influence of language-specific features on Putonghua cleft palate speech. The spectral study contributed {{to our understanding of the}} differences in affricate production between speakers with cleft and their typical speaking peers. The investigation of the relationship between spectral features and the perception of alveolar and retroflex affricates provided specific clinical directions for establishing the correct place of articulation. Further research is needed to explore the contribution of other variables (e. g., age of palatoplasty) to the error patterns identified in the present study. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|In {{the public}} schools, the speech clinician's {{caseload}} generally consists largely {{of children with}} articulation errors. Since the caseload is often large, the speech clinician {{may be unable to}} see the children enrolled in speech more than twice weekly. As a result, children may be enrolled for long periods, some for several years, and still not be using the error sounds in their conversational speech. Speech clinicians are in need of a method {{to improve the quality of}} their speech therapy programs. Some clinicians have been looking to behavior modification as a possible answer, since research in the areas of psychology and education has shown behavior modification to be successful. More recently, behavior modification techniques are being implemented in the area of speech pathology. The problem presented in this research is a comparison of the traditional method of articulation therapy with a method using operant conditioning techniques to modify behavior. Charles Van Riper's paradigm for articulation therapy is the traditional method that will be followed. A token reinforcement program will be utilized to modify the articulation errors in the experimental group. The population to be studied is elementary age children who attend a public school and exhibit one or more <b>misarticulations.</b> If the results of the proposed research indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups or that the control group is significantly more improved, speech clinicians can continue with the traditional therapy method presently in use. However, if the experimental group is significantly more improved, speech clinicians may have cause to examine their present therapy techniques and reevaluate their effectiveness. Because operant conditioning techniques involve a systematic approach in addition to reinforcement schedules, speech materials and activities may have to be changed to accommodate this approach to therapy.

40|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{systemic}} or reliable procedure for school speech clinicians to evaluate {{whether or not the}} elementary age child should be released from or retained in articulation therapy. Traditional techniques of estimating whether or not a child has established automatization of correct phoneme production which will carry-over into speaking situations outside the therapy room have proven to be less than reliable and in many cases impractical. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to obtain additional data on a procedure designed to estimate the automatization of correct articulatory production. It was hypothesized that when correct production of the phonemes /r/ and /s/ was not disrupted by auditory masking, automatization of these phonemes may be assumed; when correct production of the phonemes was disrupted, automatization may not be assumed. Subjects included 76 elementary school children ranging from first to sixth grade with a mean age of 8 years, 6 months. Testing procedures consisted of three separate experimental conditions. Under condition I all potential subjects with both /r/ and frontal /s/ <b>misarticulations</b> were administered the McDonald Deep Test of Articulation under normal testing conditions. After calculating the percentage of correct articulations, those subjects which scored 90 % or better correct production of their particular target phoneme (/r/ or /s/) then participated in condition II. The children from both the /r/ and frontal /s/ experimental groups that achieved the 90 % correct production criteria during condition I were then divided into two separate groups for testing under condition II. Condition II took place during the same session as condition I and required a readministration of the McDonald Deep Test. During this condition, however, two different sound levels of competing speech (85 dB SPL and 65 dB SPL) were presented binaurally to children in both the /r/ and /s/ experimental groups. The competing speech consisted of a tape recording of several individuals speaking at the same time. Condition III took place in September after three months of summer vacation. During condition III the McDonald Deep Test of Articulation was again readministered without auditory masking to each subject who participated in condition II. Results demonstrated that for all four experimental groups combined, the subjects’ performance on the Deep Test during auditory masking as a criterion for dismissal was significantly better (P Advisor: Walter H.
