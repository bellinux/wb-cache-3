25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes whole bunches of grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common {{reproduction}} method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester</b> are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|E

50|$|Cane lifts became {{redundant}} {{after the}} widespread introduction of chopper <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesters.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> harvesting was attempted with little real success {{from the late}} 19th century. The development of <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesters</b> accelerated from World War II. The first harvesters cut the cane as whole stalks. This meant that the labour-intensive task of bundling whole cane stalks and loading them continued. From the early 1950s, mechanical loaders alleviated this problem to some extent.|$|R

500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester.</b> It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{harvesters}} can {{be effective}} at clearing aquatic weeds but the machines are expensive and the process {{may need to be}} repeated several times in a growing season. Small fragments of weed remain in the water and may spread to other locations thereby aiding in the dispersal of invasive species. Some areas may be too shallow for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester</b> and it may be unable to access restricted locations. Submerged tree stumps can damage the machine. An alternative to mechanical harvesting is the use of herbicides, which are easy to apply and less expensive, but may have unwanted impacts on the environment.|$|E

50|$|Difficulties in {{harvesting}} are {{the major}} barriers of orchard production and development the plants potential as a cash-crop. Harvesting the fruit is problematic because the fruit does not easily release from the stem. Different <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester</b> have been developed, such as shaking, vacuum and quick freezing, but most have disadvantages of fruit and bark damage and low efficient. Except when frozen on the shrub, fresh fruit mechanical harvesting {{is still in the}} development stage. This is mainly due to the difficulty in separating the stem(pedicel) from the berry (pericarp). The mechanical harvesting method usually eliminates the necessity for maintenance pruning, leaving a hedge that has been uniformly cut back. A trunk clamp-on vibrator harvester may be used when the fruit is frozen on the shrub, with this method leave and wood contamination is high and an additional step of berry cleaning is necessary.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic {{vegetation}} commonly seen {{within the}} lake itself include widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), filamentous green algae (Enteromorpha and Cladophora sp.), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), dead man’s fingers (Codium fragile) and occasionally wireweed (Sargassum muticum). Growth of these aquatic plants reaches a peak in mid-June, {{and the subsequent}} die-off and decomposition can result in bad odors, unsightly appearance, and depletion of oxygen in the water column. To prevent this nuisance condition, the City uses a floating <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester</b> to remove excess growth during the summer months. The most common aquatic plants in Lake Merritt are tiny, free-floating phytoplankton. Visitors often do not appreciate the sometimes-murky water in the lake, but the cloudiness represents a water column rich in microscopic life, providing a basis for a diverse and thriving web of animal life at the lake, both marine and avian.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{are large}} {{tractors}} that straddle grapevine trellises and, using firm plastic or rubber rods, strike the fruiting {{zone of the}} grapevine to dislodge the grapes from the rachis. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{have the advantage of}} being able to cover a large area of vineyard land in {{a relatively short period of}} time, and with a minimum investment of manpower per harvested ton. A disadvantage of mechanical harvesting is the indiscriminate inclusion of foreign non-grape material in the product, especially leaf stems and leaves, but also, depending on the trellis system and grapevine canopy management, may include moldy grapes, canes, metal debris, rocks and even small animals and bird nests. Some winemakers remove leaves and loose debris from the grapevine before mechanical harvesting to avoid such material being included in the harvested fruit. In the United States mechanical harvesting is seldom used for premium winemaking because of the indiscriminate picking and increased oxidation of the grape juice. In other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand), mechanical harvesting of premium winegrapes is more common because of general labor shortages.|$|R

25|$|A <b>mechanical</b> grape <b>harvester</b> {{works by}} beating the vine with rubber sticks {{to get the}} vine to drop its fruit onto a {{conveyor}} belt that brings the fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesters</b> have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|R

Each stalk can produce 1.1 to 1.4 kg, although the commercial yield is about 900 g per stalk.

50|$|The Phragmites reedbeds on {{the north}} shore stretch for some 15 km and are thought to be the largest and most {{continuous}} in the UK. The reedbeds are tidal and flooded on spring tides. They support nationally important breeding bird populations. With the help of groynes built out into the estuary, reedbeds were planted in the 19th century to protect agricultural land, and have since expanded naturally. Much of the agricultural land was formerly marsh which itself had been drained and cultivated by Cistercian monks in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1974 commercial harvesting of the reedbeds for thatching reed began, and has continued to the present day, albeit now on a reduced scale by RSPB. At its height approximately 30-40% of the reedbeds were cut by Tayreed (company) on an annual rotation (single wale) using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvester</b> known as a Seiga.
