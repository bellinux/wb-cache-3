50|$|The Kururi Line KiHa E130-100 series sets have DT74A <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR259A trailer bogies.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{research}} project High Efficiency <b>Motor</b> <b>Bogie</b> for Modern Trains (HEMBOT), {{a new light}} weight <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> has been developed by introducing the latest development technologies and modern light weight materials in a simultaneous approach by component suppliers, research institutes, system integrators and operators. As a result the capabilities and potentials of this development were demonstrated on prototypes by extensive testing in a real locomotive...|$|R
50|$|The two-car {{sets are}} {{numbered}} S01 onward, and are formed {{as shown below}} with both cars motored (one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> per car).|$|E
50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on a TR255D non-powered trailer bogie at the outer end, and a DT79 <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> at the inner end.|$|E
50|$|The three-car {{sets are}} {{numbered}} A01 onward, and are formed {{as shown below}} with all three cars motored (one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> per car).|$|E
50|$|The trains use bolsterless bogies {{developed}} from those used on earlier E259 series and E657 series trains. <b>Motored</b> <b>bogies</b> with capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment (rear bogies on car 1 and 3) are designated DT81, <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> equipped anti-roll devices (cars 2, 5, 7, and 10) are designated DT82, and <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> not equipped with either (cars 6 and 11) are designated DT81A. Non-powered (trailer) bogies are designated TR265, and {{are equipped with}} a parking brake and capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment, but those not equipped with a parking brake (rear bogies on cars 4 and 14, and both bogies on car 9) are designated TR265A, and those on car 8, which not equipped with either are designated TR265B.|$|R
50|$|Both types use {{the same}} bogies as the 701 series EMUs: DT61A <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR246A trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|The trains run on bolsterless bogies {{with full}} active suspension. The <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> are {{designated}} KD-320, and the trailer bogies are designated KD-320A.|$|R
50|$|Cars 2 and 5 {{each have}} two single-arm {{pantographs}} (only one is normally used), and cars 7 and 10 each have one. Cars 1 and 3 each {{have only one}} <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> (at the inner ends).|$|E
50|$|The 1st to 4th batch sets (01-21) {{are formed}} identically as follows, with four motored ("M") cars and two non-powered trailer ("T") cars, and car 1 at the {{northern}} end. Motored cars 3 and 4 in sets 16 to 21 each have only one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1928-30 {{the cars}} were {{converted}} to use electro-pneumatic brakes and the formation changed to 7-cars DM-T-T-SM-CT-T-DM, the SM cars having only one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie.</b> After 1938 guard control air-operated doors were installed and a control trailer bogie motored with equipment from the recently scrapped electric locomotives. The formation was DM-T-T-SM-SM-T-T-DM.|$|E
50|$|When John Aspinall was {{appointed}} General Manager, Hoy became Chief Mechanical Engineer. His principal contribution was {{the design of}} an electrification system for the Liverpool to Southport line, including <b>motor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 14-car set {{was mounted}} on a total of 16 bogies: four TR257 trailer bogies (cars 1, 7, 8, 14), six TR258 shared trailer bogies, and six DT73 shared <b>motor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} {{systems and the}} competitiveness of the European rail industry requires innovative solutions, which can enhance comfort and performance as well as reduce system costs. In competition with other {{transport systems}} environmental friendly trains and track systems with high interoperative capabilities {{are more and more}} important. Within the project "High Efficiency <b>Motor</b> <b>Bogie</b> for modern Trains" (HEMBOT), a new fight-weight <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> has been developed by component producers, research institutes and end-users introducing modern development technologies and lightweight materials in a simultaneous approach. The capabilities and potential of this development were demonstrated by extensive testing of a prototype mounted on a locomotive...|$|R
5000|$|The trains have {{unpainted}} {{stainless steel}} bodies, with an exterior livery featuring red highlights. Each motored car has one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie.</b> The trains will be branded [...] "Red Wing", with logos {{applied to the}} body sides and to the prominent anti-fall plates on the front ends, which inspired the name.|$|E
5000|$|The {{order was}} made up of 192 motor cars and 228 trailers. The motor cars had wooden bodies on steel underframes and one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> {{containing}} two GE69 traction motors each rated at [...] controlled with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) equipment. Both bogies carried shoegear, that were connected together by a power bus line. One hundred and twenty end motor cars had one driving position, the reminder with two diving positions were intended for the centre of trains. Twenty end motor cars were built with luggage compartments but these were soon replaced with seating. The trailer cars were built entirely of wood, thirty two having driving positions. The trains were fitted with the Westinghouse air brake.|$|E
50|$|There {{were major}} {{extensions}} of the City & South London and the Hampstead lines in the 1920s. The tunnels of the City & South London Railway were rebuilt {{to have the same}} diameter of the other tubes, and extended north to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to Edgware and south to another junction with the City & South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. New stock was required to run on the rebuilt City & South London and extensions so in 1922 six prototype cars were ordered from five manufacturers. With attention given to noise reduction, there were two 4 ft pneumatic doors {{on each side of the}} trailers. From this development work a total of 1460 cars of Standard Stock would be built by six manufacturers in 18 batches between 1923 and 1934. Production cars were first ordered in 1923, and the Hampstead line received the first of these later in the same year. Motor cars had a control compartment with a central gangway over the <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> and seated 30. The trailers seated 48 and the control trailers 44, with transverse and longitudinal seating. Initially trains had a crew of three, a driver and two guards. In 1928, once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two.|$|E
50|$|Three {{pre-production}} {{cars were}} delivered to Morioka Depot between January and February 1990, with cars KiHa 110-1 and 2 built by Fuji Heavy Industries, and KiHa 110-3 built by Niigata Tekk≈ç. As with the pre-production KiHa 100-0 cars, these initially had black front ends, pipe-style front-end skirts, black dummy exterior {{windows at the}} toilet positions, and plug doors. Cars KiHa 110-1 and 3 were equipped with Niigata DMF13HZA engines, while KiHa 110-2 was equipped with a Cummins DMF14HZA engine. All three cars used lightweight bolsterless DT58 <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR242 trailer bogies, with both axles of the <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> driven.|$|R
50|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{were the}} same DT33A bogies as used on the JNR-era 103 series EMUs, and the trailer cars used DT21T bogies {{recovered}} from withdrawn 101 series EMUs. The pantographs were also recovered from withdrawn 101 series EMUs.|$|R
5000|$|Power: [...] (12 {{traction}} <b>motors</b> on twin-motor <b>bogie)</b> or [...] (6 traction <b>motors</b> on single-motor <b>bogie)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The {{accommodation}} was of {{the open}} saloon type, then a novelty in Britain; there were gate entrances {{at the end of}} the vehicles. The trailers seated 56 persons, and the motor coaches seated 46, with a raised section over the <b>motor</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} are a two cabin {{design with}} the body built out of steel, two pantographs are fitted; one for 1500 V operation, the other for 25 kV operation. A 25 kV AC supply is stepped down and rectified to 1500 V, a 1500 V supply feeds the power electronics directly. Each of the three elements of the thyristor bridge based three phase inverter circuits are connected in parallel, with the two three phase supplies per motor being series connected. For speeds below 15 km/h one supply voltage reducing chopper circuit (French:hacheur) per <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> is used to assist control. The power electronics of the two <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> are connected in parallel, and are evaporatively cooled by boiling Freon 113.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other members}} of the Pendolino rail family, the ETR 490 {{trainset}} is composed of only three cars: two motors vehicles, with driving cabs, and a trailer vehicle in the centre. Its motor system {{is similar to that of}} an electric multiple unit because its pantograph is not located on a locomotive. The motor cars on either end of the train contain a pair of <b>motor</b> <b>bogies,</b> with one asynchronous <b>motors</b> per <b>bogie.</b> Static and other converters are also located underneath the motor cars.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} system uses layered rubber, with pneumatic secondary suspension. The bogie wheel base is 2200 mm (<b>motor</b> <b>bogie)</b> with 820 mm wheels. Braking is by tread brakes, and regenerative braking on power bogies, and by two axle-mounted disc brakes per axle on trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|On Awdry's model railway, Toby was {{represented}} by a Y6, an 0-4-0 locomotive similar to but smaller than the J70 and better suited to the 4-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> available to power the model. In 1961, Awdry wrote an article for Railway Modeller magazine {{on the construction of}} this locomotive.|$|R

50|$|From 1971 the {{interior}} was simplified to cut maintenance costs, with some doorway windows being replaced by metal and plywood, and the wooden latticed sun blinds being removed. The <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> on the trains were originally of pressed steel construction, being changed for a new design in cast steel in the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{specialized}} railwork vehicles formerly {{used for}} maintenance are also usually on view. In {{addition to the}} operational rolling stock, {{there is a large}} wheel truck and <b>motor</b> (<b>bogie)</b> on display on the platform itself, along with a series of informational panels showing the development of New York City's rail transit systems.|$|R

50|$|Two {{production}} series cars, KiHa 110-4 and 5 were subsequently delivered to Morioka Depot from Fuji Heavy Industries in March 1991. These had standard white/green front ends {{and did not}} have dummy exterior windows at the toilet position. Both cars are equipped with Niigata DMF13HZA engines, and use DT58A <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR242 trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|Three 2-car {{sets were}} built by Niigata Tekk≈ç and {{delivered}} to Morioka Depot in March 1991. These were generally built {{to the same}} specifications as the full-production KiHa 110-0 cars, with plug doors, pipe-style front-end skirts. All cars are equipped with Niigata DMF13HZA engines, and have lightweight bolsterless DT58A <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR242 trailer bogies.|$|R
