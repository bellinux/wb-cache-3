5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used bucket elevators and conveyor belts, which would eventually revolutionize <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> and 2) it used governors, a forerunner of modern automation, for control.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. These sub-optimal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises. The resulting methodology is expected to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing in-house <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes using visual management systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the verification of controls in <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems. While currently these controls are mostly validated using simulation, in the proposed approach, the correctness of the involved controls is automatically proven by means of model checking. Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis. The methodology is based on the definition of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system elements, which are models of technical components such as conveyors or pushers. By interconnecting these elements, a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is built, which thereafter can be fed into a model checker to prove certain properties on the model. In order to also verify large and complex <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems, a compositional approach is proposed. There, the overall <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is partitioned into subsystems, which are subsequently verified separately. From the proofs of the subsystems, a proof of a property of the whole <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is derived.
