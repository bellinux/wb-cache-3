25|$|As of June 2014, 50 giant planets {{have been}} {{discovered}} around giant stars. However, these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars. This could be because giant stars are more massive than the Sun (less massive stars will still be on the main sequence and will not have become giants yet) and more massive stars {{are expected to have}} more massive planets. However, the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars; therefore, the planets could be growing in mass during the stars' red giant phase. The growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind, although a much larger effect would be Roche lobe overflow causing <b>mass-transfer</b> from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{standard}} model for Type Ia supernovae explosions {{is founded on}} a proposal by Whelan and Iben in 1973, and is based upon a <b>mass-transfer</b> scenario to a degenerate companion star. In particular, the light curve of SN1972e in NGC 5253, which was observed {{for more than a}} year, was followed long enough to discover that after its broad [...] "hump" [...] in brightness, the supernova faded at a nearly constant rate of about 0.01 magnitudes per day. [...] Translated to another system of units, this is nearly the same as the decay rate of cobalt-56 (56Co), whose half-life is 77 days. [...] The degenerate explosion model predicts the production of about a solar mass of nickel-56 (56Ni) by the exploding star. The 56Ni decays with a half-life of 6.8 days to 56Co, and the decay of the nickel and cobalt provides the energy radiated away by the supernova late in its history. [...] The agreement in both total energy production and the fade rate between the theoretical models and the observations of 1972e led to rapid acceptance of the degenerate-explosion model.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{formation}} of <b>mass-transferring</b> binary systems containing black holes within globular clusters. We show {{that it is possible}} to form <b>mass-transferring</b> black hole binaries with main sequence, giant, and white dwarf companions with a variety of orbital parameters in globular clusters spanning a large range in present-day properties. All <b>mass-transferring</b> black hole binaries found in our models at late times are dynamically created. The black holes in these systems experienced a median of ∼ 30 dynamical encounters within the cluster before and after acquiring the donor. Furthermore, we show that the presence of <b>mass-transferring</b> black hole systems has little correlation with the total number of black holes within the cluster at any time. This is because the net rate of formation of black hole-non-black hole binaries in a cluster is largely independent of the total number of retained black holes. Our results suggest that the detection of a <b>mass-transferring</b> black hole binary in a globular cluster does not necessarily indicate that the host cluster contains a large black hole population.

With five key population boundaries in place, we are able to identify four principal population sub-domains, including one sub-domain that identifies where progenitors of Type Ia supernovae will reside. Given one full year of uninterrupted operation, LISA should be able to measure {{the rate at which the}} gravitational-wave frequency f and, hence, the orbital period is changing in the highest frequency subpopulation of our Galaxy’s DWD systems.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{contribution}} {{we discuss}} how neutron stars are produced and retained in globular clusters, outlining {{the most important}} dynamical channels and evolutionary events that affect the population of <b>mass-transferring</b> binaries with neutron stars and result {{in the formation of}} recycled pulsars. We confirm the importance of electron-capture supernovae in globular clusters as the major supplier of retained neutron stars. By comparing the observed millisecond pulsar population and the results obtained from simulations, we discuss several constraints on the evolution of <b>mass-transferring</b> systems. In particular, we find that in our cluster model the following mass-gaining events create populations of MSPs that do not match the observations (with respect to binary periods and companion masses or the number of produced systems) and therefore likely do not lead to NSs spun up to millisecond periods: (i) accretion during a common envelope event with a NS formed through accretion-induced collapse, and (ii) mass transfer from a WD donor.

Prior to 2016, the system's long-term optical brightness varied between apparent magnitude 12.7 and 14.2, but in early 2016, it faded to magnitude 15.8 and thereafter began a slow recovery to its normal brightness, behavior which is indicative of a temporary dropoff in the <b>mass-transfer</b> rate between the two stars.|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{stars in}} <b>mass-transferring</b> {{binaries}} accrete {{hydrogen and helium}} rich matter from their companions. Unstable nuclear burning of this matter results in Type I X-ray bursts every few hours to days. Theoretical models propose three regimes of unstable burning on neutron star surfaces and also define the critical accretion rate above which the neutron star burns fuel stably without bursting. Currently, the theoretical value for this stability boundary {{is comparable to the}} Eddington limit whereas the observational limit is estimated to 0. 3 m˙Edd. In this dissertation, we examine the boundary between stable and unstable thermonuclear burning at the surface of an accreting neutron star for a range of initial compositions. We compute different steady-state equilibrium models and use them to conduct a linear perturbation analysis.

The emission lines seen in SDSS J 1730 are very narrow, although double-peaked, implying a low-inclination, face-on accretion disc; using the measured velocities of the line peaks, we estimate i[*]≤ 11 °.
