5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} a {{dangerous}} situation, and seeing a need to avoid it, they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E

25|$|The Nordic Bronze Age was {{initially}} {{characterized by a}} warm climate that began with a climate change around 2700 BC. The climate was {{comparable to that of}} present-day central Germany and northern France and permitted a relatively dense population and good opportunities for farming; for example, grapes were grown in Scandinavia at this time. A <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> in climate occurred between 850 BC and 760 BC, introducing a wetter, colder climate and a more radical climate change began around 650 BC.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the U.S. Highway system was {{finalized}} in late 1926, one relatively <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> {{had been made to}} US2; it was swapped with US1 between Bangor and Houlton, Maine, placing US2 along the entire portion of Route 15 east of St. Johnsbury. Several other major parts of the auto trail received numbers, most notably US30 from Portland, Oregon east to Pendleton, US195 in eastern Washington, and US23 in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. In the mid-1930s, much of New York's portion of the road became US104, and the part southeast of Littleton, New Hampshire to Portland, Maine became US302, but by far the longest piece was that followed by US2 between St. Ignace and Bonners Ferry. In 1946, US2 was extended west of its original western terminus in Bonners Ferry in Idaho to Everett in Washington via Spokane along what was then Alternate US10.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E
25|$|State Highway Route 18-N {{was first}} {{designated}} in the 1923 Annual Report on Public Roads as {{running from the}} city of Hoboken northward through several communities in Bergen and Hudson County to the New York state line at Alpine. The highway was an addition to the original system designed by the New Jersey Commissioner of Public Roads in 1916, which started with thirteen state highway highways. The portion from Hoboken to Fort Lee was never officially taken over by the New Jersey State Highway Department, as when the 1927 state highway renumbering occurred, the alignment of Route 18-N south of Fort Lee had already wiped, but the designation was retained from the Fort Lee to the state line in Alpine. Route 18-N was one of four -N suffixes retained in the 1927 renumbering, however, Route 18-N was the first to be eliminated, when the new New Jersey Route 1 was realigned onto Route 18-N in a <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> in 1929. This former alignment of Route 18-N through the Palisades Cliffs has since been abandoned and was part of the Long Path, a hiking trail and scenic overlook as Old Route 9W until the Long Path was realigned on April 1, 2009.|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E

[...] This colour scheme lasted until 1896 when it was changed to an overall Victoria Lake (brown) colour with gold and blue lining. Adams changed the livery to Madder Lake in 1903 to match the locomotives, the lining became yellow and red. [...] A final <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> was to paint the waist panels of first class compartments cream to distinguish them. A constant presence was the company coat of arms being displayed on the coach sides.|$|E
