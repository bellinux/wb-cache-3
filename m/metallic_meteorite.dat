40|$|As of July 2001, 1238 Libyan meteorites {{have been}} reported. Most {{were found in}} two areas called Dar al Gani and Hamadah al Hamra. Dar al Gani is located on a plateau of marine {{carbonate}} rocks with marly components. Eight-hundred and sixty-nine meteorites between 6 g and 95 kg totalling 687 kg have been found here but the calculated mean recovery density is comparatively low with one meteorite on 6. 5 km(2). Dar al Gani is a perfect site for the recognition and preservation of meteorites. The existence of meteorites {{is the result of}} a combination of specific geological and geomorphological conditions: there is a bright-colored, old limestone plateau (< 2 Ma), under and weather conditions over long periods of time, with rapid elimination of surface water if present and low erosion rates. The preservation of meteorites is guaranteed through the absence of quartz sand on the plateau, strongly reducing wind erosion and a basic environment emerging from the carbonate ground retards rusting of <b>metallic</b> <b>meteorite</b> components. A supposed soil cover during pluvial times has probably protected older meteorites and led to a concentration of meteorites of different periods. An evaluation of Dar al Gani meteorites suggests the existence of at least 26 strewnfields and 26 meteorite pairs reducing the number of falls to, at most, 534.

50|$|The graph above {{shows the}} binding energy per nucleon of various {{elements}}. As can be seen, light {{elements such as}} hydrogen release large amounts of energy (a big increase in binding energy) when combined to form heavier elements—the process of fusion. Conversely, heavy elements such as uranium release energy when broken into lighter elements—the process of nuclear fission. In stars, rapid nucleosynthesis proceeds by adding helium nuclei (alpha particles) to heavier nuclei. Although nuclei with 58 (iron-58) and 62 (nickel-62) nucleons have the very highest binding energy per nucleon, converting nickel-56 (14 alphas) to the next element, zinc-60 (15 alphas), is a decrease in binding energy per nucleon and actually consumes energy rather than releasing any. Accordingly, nickel-56 is the last fusion product produced {{in the core of}} a high-mass star. Decay of nickel-56 explains the large amount of iron-56 seen in <b>metallic</b> <b>meteorites</b> and the cores of rocky planets.|$|R

40|$|Shock {{physics is}} the study of {{material}} properties under extreme conditions. It specifically pertains to the material state evolution through high strain-rate, high temperature, and high pressure loading. This area of research allows us to bring into view the processes that govern our universe, including those that created planets, as well as discover and create advancements for mankind, such as improved manufacturing, nuclear fusion, and planetary defence. High rate loading brings a material into a non-equilibrium state via a high pressure deformation wave propagating through the material, and the ability of the material to relax to a dynamic equilibrium state reveals important strength information. This thesis examines the role of temperature and microstructure on the dynamic strength of solid metals. Motivated by developing an understanding of meteoroid break-up and establishing techniques for asteroid deflection, this work studied the dynamic strength properties of materials, specifically looking at metallic systems. Materials of interest included recovered meteorite samples from Canyon Diablo and the Gibeon crater and commercially-fabricated metal samples of iron, various Fe-Ni compositions (including Invar), aluminium, and tantalum. The meteorites studied were predominantly Fe-based compositions, and therefore iron, Fe-Ni and Invar were of particular interest. Aluminium and tantalum were studied for comparison of Invar to another FCC metal (aluminium) and of iron to another BCC metal (tantalum). Fe-Ni samples were found to be a mix of the two crystal structures. Laser-driven shock-loading experiments were performed on each material and dynamic strength was characterised for each material as a function of temperature and strain-rate. To ascertain the temperature dependence, a system was developed for pre-heating and pre-cooling targets for laser-driven shock-loading experiments. These experiments were the first high strain-rates laser-driven shock-loading experiments on <b>metallic</b> <b>meteorites</b> and on Invar, as well as on bulk metallic glasses. Analysis was implemented through the consideration of material deformation at the solid state, microscopic, and bulk levels to account for unexpected material behaviour. The work on aluminium and Invar was important because it re-examined the classical view of categorising material relaxation at high strain-rates by crystal structure and determined that electronic structure is likely a more reasonable metric. Additionally, this work is the first to hypothesize the importance of magnetic structure on material relaxation at high strain-rates through the first dynamic loading experiments of Invar. The work on iron and tantalum furthers the exploration of transitions between microstructural deformation mechanisms (i. e. slip vs. twinning) and specifically has brought up the possibility of the existence of a dynamic temperature-dependent twinning-to-slip transition in tantalum, which has not yet been seen in any material under dynamic loading.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{process of}} planetary differentiation is the segregation of metal-sulfide and silicate phases, leading eventually {{to the formation}} of a <b>metallic</b> core. Asteroidal <b>meteorites</b> provide a glimpse of this process frozen in time from the early solar system. While chondrites represent starting materials, iron meteorites provide an end product where metal has been completely concentrated in a region of the parent asteroid. A complimentary end product is seen in metal-poor achondrites that have undergone significant igneous processing, such as angrites, HED's and the majority of aubrites. Metal-rich achondrites such as acapulcoite/lodranites, winonaites, ureilites, and metal-rich aubrites may represent intermediate stages in the metal segregation process. Among these, acapulcoite-lodranites and ureilites are examples of primary metal-bearing mantle restites, and therefore provide an opportunity to observe the metal segregation process that was captured in progress.

On sol 1634 of its mission, Opportunity left Victoria crater after investigating it for approximately 682 sols [1] and is now on a journey towards Endeavour, a 24 km diameter crater about 12 km southeast of Victoria. A priority along the way is the investigation of cobbles, which in the jargon of the MER science team denotes any loose rock fragment larger {{than a couple of}} centimeters. Cobbles investigated thus far are of diverse origin [2] and provide the only means to investigate material other than the ubiquitous sulfate-rich outcrop, basaltic sand or hematiterich spherules dubbed blueberries. Some of these cobbles are meteorites [3].

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{advances}} in the microscopic magneto-optical imaging (MOI) technique applied to rock magnetism. This technique uses the Faraday effect of a thick MO active film. The propagation of linearly polarized light parallel to the direction of magnetization of the film induces a rotation of the polarization direction of the light (Faraday rotation). For small magnetic components BZ oriented perpendicularly to the film, the Faraday angle of rotation of the polarization of perpendicular incident light is given by aF = VBZd, where V is the Verdet constant of the MO material, and d is the thickness of MO active film. Therefore, when the MO film is placed {{on top of a}} sample, the MOI technique images the perpendicular component of the magnetic field at the specimen surface. The flux density Bz is observed through the analyzer of a polarized light microscope. The MO film, or indicator, {{used in the present study}} is a bi-doped Yttrium-Iron-Garnet film of thickness 5 mm, deposited on Gadolinium-Gallium Garnet substrate (thickness 500 mm), and covered by a reflecting Al mirror (100 nm). This configuration enables us to observe magnetic fields at the surface of polished samples, such as rocks,. In this geometry, light passes through the MO active film twice, and thus the angle of rotation and the sensitivity is doubled (aF = 2 VBZd). The contrast of the MO images depends on the relative angular orientation position of polarizer and analyzer. On typically obtains a contrast between bright and dark regions corresponding to field parallel (antiparallel) to the sample normal. Subtraction of images obtained at two different analyzer angles (polarization modulation technique) increases the contrast in image of samples carrying a weak magnetization, such as natural remanent magnetization (NRM). We have obtained MO images with high spatial resolution of about 10 µm, owing to the thin MO active layer and the small sample-to-layer distance. Besides its good spatial resolution (with respect to magnetic scanning techniques), one of the main advantages is the direct comparison of the magnetic image and the reflected light image taken with the same microscope. For instance, we have successfully imaged internal structures in <b>metallic</b> grains in <b>meteorites</b> carrying SIRM. Even in the NRM state, the MOI technique combined with polarization modulation can reveal small dipole-like features within a metal grain in meteorites. Thus, the MOI technique can image surface magnetic field with 10 µm spatial resolution and appears as a very powerful tool to identify the components responsible for remanence in rock sample...|$|R

More handy reports are available (and documented) here Our envo. json file has been fixed New Terms aeolian lake ammonia ice animal manure product anoxic lake astrogeological gas astrogeological ice atmospheric escape atmospheric weather bovine dairy liquid manure caldera lake carbon dioxide ice carbon monoxide ice chthonian planet circumbinary planet climate cloud formation process composted animal manure convergent plate boundary convergent tectonic movement crater lake desert planet detritus divergent plate boundary divergent tectonic movement dwarf gas planet ecosystem environmental variability feed storage space forage material formation of liquid droplets from gaseous material in an atmosphere formation of liquid droplets in an atmosphere formation of particles in an atmosphere formation of solid particles from gaseous material in an atmosphere formation of solid particles in an atmosphere fossil worm burrow fossilization of organic material gas planet giant gas planet gravitational motion heat-treated animal manure helium planet hot Jupiter hot Neptune hydrodynamic escape hypoxic lake hypoxic water ice giant ice planet ice impact crater lake impact crater impact event iron planet Karman vortex street lake with a hypoxic hypolimnion lake with an anoxic hypolimnion lake with an oxic hypolimnion landslide lake lava planet liquid aerosol manure storage space mega-Earth mesoplanet <b>metallic</b> material <b>meteorite</b> lake meteoroid meterorite impact methane ice mini-Neptune ocean planet oxic lake oxic water particle formation process photoevaporation planetesimal plant matter poultry manure proplyd protoplanet protoplanetary disk refractory astrogeological material rift zone rockslide lake rockslide process solid aerosol space weather sub-Earth super-Earth super-Jupiter tectonic lake tectonic movement tectonic plate boundary tectonic plate subduction tectonic plate transform plate boundary transform tectonic movement volatile astrogeological material weather New imported classes PURL label [URL] has grain [URL] plate-like [URL] flattened [URL] invariant [URL] deviation(from_normal) [URL] increased variability of size [URL] decreased variability of size [URL] variability of count [URL] variant [URL] decreased variability [URL] increased variability [URL] fluctuating [URL] decreased wetness [URL] increased wetness [URL] decreased mass density [URL] increased mass density [URL] dense [URL] area density [URL] volumetric density [URL] irregular density [URL] heat conductivity [URL] electrical conductivity [URL] diluted [URL] increased concentration [URL] has disposition [URL] has member Commit log commit c 04 b 9 bf 311 dc 6712 f 739 a 820 cd 98 de 2646 cb 0 f 8 d Author: pbuttigieg Date: Tue Aug 22 01 : 47 : 44 2017 + 0200 update Makefile, fix subset IRIs, add envoAstro export commit 189 bbc 8 b 39868 a 93 dc 29 d 2 abd 7865 c 60 fdb 2 f 9 f 5 Author: pbuttigieg Date: Tue Aug 22 01 : 44 : 51 2017 + 0200 build fix commit b 0 f 0 c 07 c 6185 c 5 b 9 ccf 7 d 5092 e 35 fbe 0 c 0 aac 80 c Author: pbuttigieg Date: Tue Aug 22 01 : 36 : 46 2017 + 0200 added more planetary classes for release commit 62 fc 9 d 32200 e 4027124 a 0677 e 5 b 4 bec 08281 e 146 Author: pbuttigieg Date: Sat Aug 19 23 : 13 : 56 2017 + 0200 added planetary semantics commit dd 6 b 9 ae 35 a 8 af 7 de 04573 b 33973 e 23 b 9 ee 46575 b Author: pbuttigieg Date: Thu Aug 17 22 : 41 : 17 2017 + 0200 closes # 552 commit f 8536 df 0 f 12875 ff 90989 b 2 b 26608 bfe 17 b 8 e 33 f Author: Pier Luigi Buttigieg Date: Thu Aug 17 21 : 56 : 50 2017 + 0200 Update README.
