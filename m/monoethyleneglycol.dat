30|$|In distillation, ethanol is {{initially}} recovered in hydrated form (96 ° GL), producing vinasse or stillage as residue, at {{a ratio of}} 10 to 13 L per liter of hydrated ethanol produced. This vinasse is now managed as a soil nutrient source, and its application has been optimized within environmental control limits [21]. Hydrated bioethanol can be stored as final product or may be sent to the dehydration process, as it is an azeotropic mixture and its components cannot be separated by distillation only. The most commonly used technology in Brazil for this purpose is dehydration with addition of cyclohexane, forming a ternary azeotropic mixture. The second method, of more recent industrial use, is extractive distillation with <b>monoethyleneglycol</b> (MEG), which stands out as provider of lower energy consumption. The third method is dehydration by adsorption with molecular sieves [10].|$|E
40|$|Homopolymers of {{methacrylic acid}} (MAA), <b>monoethyleneglycol</b> methyl ether {{methacrylate}} (MEOMA), diethyleneglycol methyl ether methacrylate (MEO 2 MA), oligo(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA 475 and OEGMA 1100) and oligo(ethyleneglycol) ethyl ether methacrylate (OEGEMA 246) were synthesized with various chain lengths via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The homopolymers of MAA, MEOMA and OEGMA 1100 {{did not show}} any cloud point (CP) {{in the range of}} 0 - 100 °C, whereas at a pH value of 7, the CPs were found to be 20. 6, 93. 7, and 20. 0 °C for p(MEO 2 MA), p(OEGMA 475) and p(OEGEMA 246), respectively, with an initial monomer to initiator ratio of 50. Furthermore, statistical copolymer libraries of MAA with OEGMA 475 and OEGMA 1100 were prepared. The cloud points of the random copolymers of MAA and OEGMA 475 were found to be in the range of 20 - 90 °C; surprisingly, even though the homopolymers of MAA and OEGMA 1100 did not exhibit any LCST behavior, the copolymers of these monomers at certain molar ratios (up to 40 % OEGMA 1100) revealed a double responsive behavior for both temperature and pH. Finally, the cloud points were found to be in the range of 22 - 98 °C, measured at pH values of 2, 4, and 7, while no cloud point was detected at pH 10. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} an {{experimental}} study on transparent nanoporous titanium oxide films on glass substrates using an anodization process. Ti thin films of 50 - 90 nm have been deposited on glass substrate by dc sputtering (1. 82 ⋅ 10 - 3 Pa, 100 W) {{followed by a}} thermal treatment of 500 °C for 30 min. {{in order to improve}} the adhesion to the glass substrate. Then an anodization process was applied in order to obtain TiO 2 thin nanoporous layers using a cell consisted of three electrodes and aqueous electrolyte solution of 1 % NH 4 F concentration, <b>monoethyleneglycol</b> and DI water. After anodization the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 45 min using nitrogen gas. The layers have a nanoporous structure with pore dimensions in the range of 50 - 80 nm. FTIR and micro-Raman spectroscopy were used to identify the crystalline phase of the TiO 2 layers. Raman scattering spectra clearly identify the anatase phase on the basis of Eg modes at ~ 146 cm- 1 of the TiO 2. The FTIR spectrum showed only the peak at 614 cm − 1 which can be associated with the characteristic vibrational mode of TiO 2 anatase. The optical properties of TiO 2 thin films have been determined by ellipsometric measurements in the spectral range (0. 2 - 0. 8 µm) and a value of 2. 41 - 2. 45 was obtain for refractive index at 632 nm. Spectrophotometric measurements showed a transmittance over 70 % and an optical band gap of 3. 3 - 3. 5 eV was determined...|$|E
