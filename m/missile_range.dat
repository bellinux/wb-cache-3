5|$|On 11 April 1963, Thurmond led Congress in {{an effort}} to fund {{deployment}} of Zeus. In the first closed session of the Senate in twenty years, Zeus was debated and {{the decision was made to}} continue with the planned development of Nike-X with no Zeus deployment. The Army continued the testing program until December 1964 at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range,</b> and May 1966 at Kwajalein <b>Missile</b> <b>Range.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several major motion {{pictures}} were filmed {{in or near}} Alamogordo. The 2007 film Transformers was shot primarily at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range,</b> with additional filming at Holloman Air Force Base, both in the Alamogordo area.|$|E
5|$|Future Combat Systems is {{a wide-ranging}} {{modernization}} {{project of the}} US Army. Much of the work will be done at Fort Bliss, with some at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range</b> and some at Holloman Air Force Base. Alamogordo is expected to get some economic benefit due to its proximity to these three bases.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} {{the site was}} open on the first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range</b> {{announced}} that due to budgetary constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification test flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range</b> between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Zeus missile began {{testing in}} 1959 at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range</b> (WSMR) and early {{launches}} were generally successful. Longer range testing {{took place at}} Naval Air Station Point Mugu, firing out over the Pacific Ocean. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds of yards of the warheads, and even low-flying satellites.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, United States {{officials}} {{agreed to}} extend the range limit to 300 km, which only applied to high-velocity, free flight ballistic missiles, excluding slower, surface-skimming cruise weapons. South Korea developed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and cruise missile called Hyunmoo-3. The UAV would not have any limitation in range while the cruise <b>missile’s</b> <b>range</b> was 1500 kilometers (930 miles). [...] South Korea's <b>missile</b> <b>ranges</b> were less than North Korea’s missiles such as Rodong (1300 kilometer-ranged ballistic missile) and Taepodong-2 (6000 kilometer-ranged intercontinental ballistic missile).|$|R
50|$|Modern submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missiles {{are closely related}} to intercontinental ballistic <b>missiles</b> (<b>range</b> of over 5500 km), and in many cases SLBMs and ICBMs may be part of the same family of weapons.|$|R
50|$|Tomahawk Block III {{introduced}} in 1993 added time-of-arrival control and improved accuracy for Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator (DSMAC) and jam-resistant GPS, smaller, lighter WDU-36 warhead, engine improvements and extended <b>missile's</b> <b>range.</b>|$|R
5|$|Vega {{became the}} first solitary main-sequence star beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was {{observed}} from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range.</b> In 1983, Vega {{became the first}} star {{found to have a}} disk of dust. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range</b> on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
5|$|In September 1966, Olds {{was tapped}} to command an F-4C Phantom wing in Southeast Asia. En route he {{arranged}} with the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, (where Col. James was now Deputy Commander of Operations) {{to be checked}} out in the Phantom, completing the 14-step syllabus in just five days. His instructor was Major William L. Kirk, the 4453rd CCTW's Standardization and Evaluation officer, who {{had been one of}} Olds' pilots at RAF Bentwaters, and who later commanded the United States Air Forces Europe as a full general. Kirk accompanied Olds for practice firing of AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles on the Point Mugu <b>missile</b> <b>range</b> while Olds was en route to Travis Air Force Base for his charter flight overseas. Olds rewarded Kirk by granting him a transfer to his command in Thailand in March 1967.|$|E
50|$|Initially it was {{believed}} that {{there is a possibility that}} Hwasong-10 likewise is using the Nodong's kerosene and corrosion inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) propellants, reducing the <b>missile's</b> <b>range</b> by about half.|$|R
50|$|A newer main charge liner {{produces}} a higher velocity jet. While making the warhead smaller, this change {{makes it more}} effective, leaving more room for propellant for the main rocket motor, and thus increasing the <b>missile's</b> <b>range.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Hyunmoo-2A was {{the first}} of South Korea's {{attempts}} to develop an indigenous ballistic missile with an increased range, more so than Hyunmoo-1. Due to an agreement in 2001 with the MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime), the <b>missile's</b> <b>range</b> was limited to 300km.|$|R
5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range.</b> The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E
5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range,</b> a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were an}} actual battle.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 54 {{traverses}} {{through the}} north and south ends of the city. At {{the south end of the}} city, White Sands Boulevard is a major named street that merges into U.S. Route 54/Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route, running south to El Paso, Texas. In the south part of the city, U.S. Route 70 splits from U.S. Route 54 in a southwestern direction towards Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands National Monument, White Sands <b>Missile</b> <b>Range,</b> and Las Cruces. At the north end of the city, White Sands Boulevard and the Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route become a merged U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 70 running north to Tularosa. U.S. Route 82 starts at the same point and runs east to Cloudcroft and the mountain communities of Otero County, and then to Artesia. Meanwhile, in Tularosa, U.S. 70 and U.S. 54 both split in which U.S. 70 heads east through the mountains, and towards Ruidoso and Roswell, while U.S. 54 heads north towards Carrizozo and keeps going north until it heads east again starting in Vaughn.|$|E
50|$|A {{prediction}} for {{the possible}} range, following an optimum trajectory, {{has been given}} at 6700 km or as much as 10,400 km not {{taking into account the}} Earth’s rotation. If true, then this brings the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii within the <b>missile's</b> <b>range.</b>|$|R

5|$|When within <b>missile</b> <b>range</b> of the enemy, Alexander {{gave the}} order to charge. He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, {{commanded}} by Parmenion, was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central phalanx crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander {{and the rest of}} his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing.|$|E
