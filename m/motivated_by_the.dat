5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration.

Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections {{to the creation of a}} national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed.

5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} {{colleague}} of Karl, who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist. The character is <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of his identity and family, as well as betrayal from Karl by his affair with Kieran's wife before her death. Frain believed that Kieran is the most disturbing character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E

5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prospect of military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E

The retention of one is also <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E

40|$|Developing and {{producing}} a holistic individual {{has been a}} major concern to Malaysian education system. Therefore, Malaysia education system was formed based on its mission to produce a balance and a holistic individual from physical, emotion, spiritual and intellectual potential based on a firm belief in and devotion to God. However, there was a gap between the current practice in education and the Malaysia’s education philosophy especially in the spiritual development domain. Meanwhile, self development from spiritual potential is the basic needs of every human being because it motivates good human behaviour and how they respond to the environment. Since, man is a combination of the soul and the body, man also carries dual tendencies which are tendencies to become good (<b>motivate</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rational soul) and bad (<b>motivate</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> animal soul). Therefore, spiritual development process is about a continuous exercise of sub-ordination the animal soul to enslave itself in submission {{to the power of the}} rational soul. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the philosophy behind self-development from spiritual domain and develop the conceptual model for spiritual development process...|$|R
5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In both cases, the actors were <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea of data compression. For example, {{the value of}} the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
