50|$|A {{hydraulic}} cylinder (also called a linear hydraulic motor) is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> {{that is used}} to give a unidirectional force through a unidirectional stroke. It has many applications, notably in construction equipment (engineering vehicles), manufacturing machinery, and civil engineering.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> {{functions}} to execute movement by converting {{one kind of}} motion, such as rotary motion, into another kind, such as linear motion. An example is a rack and pinion. The operation of mechanical actuators is based on combinations of structural components, such as gears and rails, or pulleys and chains.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} motor is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> that converts hydraulic pressure and flow into torque and angular displacement (rotation). The {{hydraulic motor}} is the rotary counterpart of the hydraulic cylinder as a linear actuator. Mostly broadly, {{the category of}} devices called hydraulic motors has sometimes included those that run on hydropower—namely, water engines and water motors—but in today's terminology the name usually refers more specifically to motors that use hydraulic fluid as part of closed hydraulic circuits in modern hydraulic machinery.|$|E

50|$|A DM {{usually has}} many {{degrees of freedom}}. Typically, these degrees of freedom are {{associated}} with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuators</b> and it can be roughly taken that one actuator corresponds to one degree of freedom.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the FlexFoil. A modern {{interpretation}} of wing warping, internal <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuators</b> bend a lattice that changes the airfoil shape. It may have a flexible gap seal at the transition between fixed and flexible airfoils.|$|R
50|$|M1 is a 40 metre main {{parabolic}} reflector {{made up of}} 420 aluminium panels organized in 10 concentric rings. Each panel is fabricated from an aluminium plate approximately 1.8 mm thick and is covered with an epoxy {{to protect against the}} elements. The panels are mounted on a re-enforced aluminium skeleton and each panel is associated with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> that allows precision movements and orientation of each panel to 14 microns. The primary focus is located 15 metres from the parabolas vertex and is coincident with one of the foci of the secondary. The entire primary reflector and support structure weighs 200 tons.|$|E
5000|$|A {{roller screw}} is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> {{similar to a}} ball screw that uses rollers as the load {{transfer}} elements between nut and screw instead of balls. The rollers are typically threaded but may also be grooved depending on roller screw type. Providing more bearing points than ball screws within a given volume, roller screws can be more compact for a given load capacity while providing similar efficiency (75%-90%) at low to moderate speeds, and maintain relatively high efficiency at high speeds. Roller screws can surpass ball screws in regard to positioning precision, load rating, rigidity, speed, acceleration, and lifetime. Standard roller screw actuators can achieve dynamic load ratings above 130 tons of force (exceeded in single-unit actuator capacity only by hydraulic cylinders).|$|E
50|$|A one-bit <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> assumes two positions: {{one when}} on, another when off. The motion of several one-bit {{actuators}} {{can be combined}} and weighted with a whiffletree mechanism to produce finer steps. The IBM Selectric typewriter uses such as system. When a typewriter key is pressed, it moves a metal bar (interposer) down that has several lugs. The lugs are the information bits. When a key is pressed, its interposer is moved by the motor. If a lug is present at one position, it will move the corresponding selector bail (bar); if the lug is not present, the selector bail stays where it is. The discrete motions of the bails are combined by a whiffle tree, and the output controls the rotation and tilt of the Selectric's typeball.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{actuators}} typically convert {{rotary motion}} of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears {{to which the}} knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator.</b> Another family of actuators {{are based on the}} segmented spindle. Rotation of the jack handle is converted mechanically into the linear motion of the jack head. Mechanical actuators are also frequently used in the field of lasers and optics to manipulate the position of linear stages, rotary stages, mirror mounts, goniometers and other positioning instruments. For accurate and repeatable positioning, index marks may be used on control knobs. Some actuators include an encoder and digital position readout. These are similar to the adjustment knobs used on micrometers except their purpose is position adjustment rather than position measurement.|$|E
5000|$|The port {{concept is}} {{particularly}} useful where multiple energy domains {{are involved in}} the same system and a unified, coherent analysis is required such as with mechanical-electrical analogies or bond graph analysis. [...] Connection between energy domains is by means of transducers. A transducer may be a one-port as viewed by the electrical domain, but with the more generalised definition of port it is a two-port. For instance, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> has one port in the electrical domain and one port in the mechanical domain. [...] Transducers can be analysed as two-port networks {{in the same way as}} electrical two-ports. That is, by means of a pair of linear algebraic equations or a 2×2 transfer function matrix. However, the variables at the two ports will be different and the two-port parameters will be a mixture of two energy domains. For instance, in the actuator example, the z-parameters will include one electrical impedance, one mechanical impedance, and two transimpedances that are ratios of one electrical and one mechanical variable.|$|E
50|$|Ultra high {{intensity}} lasers are now {{commonly used in}} several fields of physics research, including X-rays, wakefield acceleration, proton generation and ICF, with the common idea of intensely focusing a laser beam to energy densities that can reach 1022 W/cm2 on a target. To achieve such a goal, the laser beam typically passes through several amplification stages and is transported with larger and larger optical components. As a result, the beam is affected by thermal effects and optical aberrations which distort the wavefront and affect the focusing quality. This decreases light intensity on the target. Usually, both spectral and spatial phases are adaptively controlled {{in order to achieve}} the required focusing. Over the last 2 decades, adaptive optics for wavefront correction and beam shaping have been commonly used in laser facilities by means of a wavefront sensor that measures the spatial phase and a deformable mirror that corrects it. Adaptive Optics systems (AOs) are now a must have in ultra-{{high intensity}} facilities, {{with some of the most}} recent systems needing several AOs to function.. Recently Imagine Optic developed <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> based deformable mirrors to specifically address the phase correction in laser systems. Key points of this technology are the optical quality, the capacity of correction, great stability and linearity and simplified maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|In elastographic {{applications}} different {{means to}} generate {{and measure the}} propagation of shear waves in tissue are used. One of the early methods for generating shear waves in tissue was to use external <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuators.</b> Starting in the mid-1990s, another method was introduced to create shear waves which involved the use of focused ultrasound to produce acoustic radiation force.|$|R
50|$|Electro-mechanical {{actuators}} {{are similar}} to <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuators</b> except that the control knob or handle is replaced with an electric motor. Rotary motion of the motor is converted to linear displacement. There are many designs of modern linear actuators and every company that manufactures them tends to have a proprietary method. The following is a generalized description of a very simple electro-mechanical linear actuator.|$|R

5000|$|NASA {{tested the}} ROSA {{technology}} in vacuum tubes on earth several years ago, but still decided {{to test it}} in space on June 18 of 2017. Over the weekend of June 17-18, 2017, engineers on the ground remotely operated the International Space Station’s robotic Canadarm2 to extract the Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) experiment from the SpaceX Dragon resupply ship. After the observation the mechanism was not planned to be retrieved back to earth.The solar array unfurled June 18, extending like a party favor with tensioning booms {{on both sides of}} the 5.5-foot-wide (1.6-meter-wide) wing. NASA decided to conduct continuous tests for a week and observe its consequences [...]Engineers observed the behavior of the solar array as the space station sailed through day and night during each 90-minute orbit of Earth, exposing it to extreme temperature swings. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuator</b> also introduced vibrations and oscillations to gauge the array’s response to structural loads, and engineers measured the power production from solar cells attached to the panel. The experiments went well, but ground controllers were unable to lock the solar panel back in its stowed configuration after rolling it up. Anyhow the solar array was successfully jettisoned from the International Space Station. Mission managers planned to roll up the panel and return it to the Dragon spacecraft’s external payload bay, which would burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. Certainly, the Air Force is interested from a LEO to GEO (low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit) transfer perspective. There are some really cool applications for ROSA coming down the pike.|$|E

40|$|Absfrucf- We {{present an}} all-aluminum MEMS process (Al-MEMS) for the {{fabrication}} of large-gap electrostatic actuators with process steps that {{are compatible with}} the future use of underlying, pre-fabricated CMOS control circuitry. The process is purely additive above the substrate as opposed to processes that depend on etching pits into the silicon, and thereby permits {{a high degree of}} design freedom. Multilayer aluminum metallization is used with organic sacrificial layers to build up the actuator structures. Oxygen-based dry etching is used to remove the sacrificial layers. While this approach has been previously used by other investigators to fabricate optical modulators and displays, the specific process presented herein has been optimized for driving <b>mechanical</b> <b>actuators</b> with relatively large travels.
