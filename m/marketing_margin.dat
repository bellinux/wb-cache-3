40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the Korean dairy {{industry}} has been affected by considerable reductions in non-tariff barriers {{as a result of}} trade liberalisation. The dairy marketing system in particular has had many regulations and barriers removed. The question arises as to the effect of trade liberalisation and reductions in protection on imported dairy product <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> in Korea. This study determined imported dairy product <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> in Korea and assessed how they had changed over the past 15 years. The most important factors responsible for the trends and fluctuations observed in those margins were identified and estimated. An attempt at a product-focused method was made on cheese and skim milk powder (SMP), which are generally representative of dairy products as a whole. Descriptive and econometric methods were both used to identify the most important determinants of the aggregate cost of processing and distributing imported dairy products. A cheese (MMCHE) model and a SMP (MMSMP) model were developed and estimated. The two models estimated cheese and SMP <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> respectively as functions of exchange rates, trade liberalisation, wage rates and transportation costs. Both models were estimated using standard and stepwise regressions. Results obtained from this analysis suggest that changes in earnings (wages) were the strongest influence on imported dairy product <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> during the past 15 years. However, these results cannot explain the fall in cheese and SMP <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> after 1995 as this coincided with a rise in wage rates. The increase in CIF (Cost of Insurance and Freight) prices for these products was largely responsible for the smaller margins. Because exchange rates are a large element of CIF price, it is believed that <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> were closely associated with the value of the exchange rate. Conclusions are based on descriptive indicators and an econometric analysis that examined the relationships between economic factors and <b>marketing</b> <b>margins.</b> The impact of trade liberalisation on imported dairy product <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> was mixed with other economic factors. This study concludes that trade liberalisation has not in general been associated with lower imported dairy product <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> in Korea.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTian XiaThis {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of a new approach to include the interaction of vertically differentiated products, a subject that has been largely ignored in previous studies, to analyze the market power of exporters and importers in the world markets of agricultural commodities. Three theoretical models, a residual demand elasticity (RDE) model, a residual supply elasticity (RSE) model, and a two-country partial equilibrium trade model, are developed, and the corresponding empirical models are specified for U. S. -Japan soybean trade. Genetically modified (GM) and non-genetically modified (non-GM) soybeans are vertically differentiated products in the sense that GM soybeans are largely defined as an inferior substitute to non-GM soybeans. I compare two versions of these models: a new approach in which the interaction between non-GM and GM soybeans is taken into account and the traditional approach in which the interaction is ignored. In each of the three models (the RDE model, the RSE model, and the partial equilibrium trade model), the traditional approach overestimates the <b>market</b> <b>margin</b> of U. S. non-GM soybean exporters and that of Japanese non-GM soybean importers. By considering the interaction between non-GM and GM soybeans, the new approach greatly reduces the estimates of the corresponding <b>market</b> <b>margins</b> of U. S. exporters and Japanese importers to improve the accuracy of such estimates. The statistical significance of the coefficient estimate of the interaction term, the U. S. GM soybean price or the Japanese GM soybean price, in all three models suggests that the new approach, which includes the interaction between non-GM and GM soybeans, is necessary and preferred. The partial equilibrium trade model includes both an RDE equation and an RSE equation in a system to address the possible contemporaneous cross-equation correlation. Thus, the estimation results of the partial equilibrium trade model are further improved, compared to those of the RDE model and the RSE model. Using the traditional approach to estimate the partial equilibrium trade model, I find that the U. S. non-GM soybean exporters’ <b>market</b> <b>margin</b> is 56. 5 % and the Japanese non-GM soybean importers’ <b>market</b> <b>margin</b> is 16. 1 %. However, the results obtained by using the new approach show that the <b>market</b> <b>margins</b> of U. S. exporters and Japanese importers are 33. 2 % and 6 %, respectively. By taking into account the interaction between non-GM and GM soybeans, the new approach improves the accuracy of the estimates of <b>market</b> <b>margins</b> of soybean exporters and importers. U. S. non-GM soybean exporters do have a significant <b>market</b> <b>margin</b> in international <b>markets,</b> but it is not as large as the one suggested by the traditional approach. Although Japanese non-GM soybean importers enjoy some <b>market</b> <b>margin,</b> it is relatively small. The theoretical and empirical models and results in this dissertation provide new and more accurate estimates of residual demand and supply elasticities and market power and improve the understanding on world soybean markets.

40|$|Three {{methods of}} calculating the derived {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} Choice slaughter beef are used: (a) a traditional <b>marketing</b> <b>margin</b> approach, (b) a modified <b>marketing</b> <b>margin</b> approach, and (c) an econometric, inverse demand model approach. The first method is more restrictive than the second but both tend to overestimate beef price flexibility and revenue changes. The econometric model, though an incomplete demand system, yields demand elasticities that are more consistent with marketing flexibility but are less pronounced than estimates of a complete system. An example using a two-year revenue forecast compares slaughter revenue adjustments based on the first margin method with those based on structural demand models. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E
40|$|This paper employs {{threshold}} cointegration {{tests that}} allow for asymmetric adjustment towards a long-run equilibrium relationship {{to examine the relationship}} between producer and retail pork prices in Switzerland. The short-run adjustments are also examined with asymmetric error correction models that are compared to the conventional symmetric error correction models. The results indicate that price transmission between the producer and retail levels is asymmetric, in the sense that increases in producer prices that lead to declines in <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> are passed on more quickly to retail prices than decreases in producer prices that result in increases in the <b>marketing</b> <b>margins.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Journal articleImprovements in {{agricultural}} productivity and reductions in marketing costs in Mozambique are analysed using a {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) model. The model incorporates detailed <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> and separates household demand for marketed and home-produced goods. Individual simulations of improved agricultural technology and lower <b>marketing</b> <b>margins</b> yield welfare gains across the economy. In addition, a combined scenario reveals significant synergy effects, as gains exceed the sum of gains from the individual scenarios. Relative welfare improvements are higher for poor rural households, while factor returns increase in roughly equal proportions, an attractive feature when assessing the political feasibility of policy initiatives.
