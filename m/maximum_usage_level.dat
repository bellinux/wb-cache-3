A cycling ergometer was used in the maximum perseverance training test (spiroergometry). The maximum heart rate test was completed in the outdoor terrain. We also carried out 5 km terrain test on the road bicycle. Results: In conclusion, an endurance of a 41 year old female can be improved with a suitable training plan.

Results of purposive survey of professionals with structured ques-tionnaires were analysed using descriptive, severity index, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests. It was concluded that stakeholders have not fully utilized the documents, some specific factors have greater influence on the preparation {{and use of the}} documents, construction methodology and programme have greatest influence on project costs and time, while project quality management plan and construction methodology have greatest influence on project quality. Influences of <b>usage</b> <b>level</b> of selected documents on project performance do not significantly vary. It is recommended that all documents should be made mandatory by authorities. Stakehold-ers should prioritize and harmonize the factors affecting each production document and effectively utilize them during execution...|$|R

40|$|A {{frequent}} assumption in nonuniform pricing {{models is}} that local maximizing conditions are met exactly once for each purchasing consumer; no consumer can be indifferent between two nonadjacent <b>usage</b> <b>levels.</b> Each consumer then responds {{to a change}} in marginal price only by incrementally reducing her usage. More realistically, maximizing conditions are sometimes twice met for some interior users who can be indifferent between nonadjacent <b>usage</b> <b>levels</b> and may, therefore, jump discretely if marginal prices change at either level. The author derives a monopolist's generalized price schedule under these circumstances and shows that marginal price may fall below marginal cost. Copyright 1994 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

Here, the authors specifically {{examine the effects of}} adoption timing on post-adoption usage and disadoption. Using a longitudinal, individual-level usage data set of 6296 adopters of a new telecom service, they show that the earliest adopters have lower initial <b>usage</b> <b>levels</b> than do later adopters. However, early adopters show increasing usage after adoption, whereas late adopters tend to decrease their usage over time. Also, disadoption rates are higher among later adopters.
