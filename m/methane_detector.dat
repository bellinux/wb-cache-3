5000|$|Since {{naturally}} occurring methane is odorless - utility companies add mercaptans to alert {{people to the}} presence of this flammable gas - no one had noticed the buildup of methane, so it may have accumulated to an explosive concentration slowly. The source of the methane gas was controversial; early theories involved a biogenic origin for the methane, in which it was seen as the product of decomposition of organic matter from an old swamp. In this scenario, a rising water table forced the gas from the pore spaces within the soil upwards to the surface. A later theory, and the one now accepted, was that the gas originated in the oil field itself, and had migrated to the surface along a combination of the 3rd Street Fault and any number of improperly abandoned boreholes from the hundreds of now-lost wells drilled {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century. The reinjection of wastewater into the field to increase oil recovery increased the reservoir pressure to the point that gas was forced upwards along the paths of least resistance - newly formed fractures along the fault, as well as the old wellbores - until it reached the ground surface. Isotopic analysis of the near-surface methane supported this theory, as the specific isotope distributions did not match what would have been expected had the gas been recently produced by a recent biogenic mechanism, and they correlated strongly with isotopic analysis of oil field gas. This finding had enormous implications for all of the urban development over old oil fields, and resulted in the construction of gas monitoring and venting wells in several locations in Los Angeles. [...] The city of Los Angeles designated approximately 400 blocks overlying the old oil field as a [...] "High Potential Methane Zone" [...] as a result of the 1985 explosion and subsequent investigation, and later required all structures to have a <b>methane</b> <b>detector,</b> to give warning of accumulation of the gas before it could attain explosive concentrations.|$|E
40|$|Detection of leaks of {{fugitive}} {{greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) from landfills {{and natural gas}} infrastructure is critical for not only their safe operation but also for protecting the environment. Current inspection practices involve moving a <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> within the target area by a person or vehicle. This procedure is dangerous, time consuming, labor intensive and above all unavailable when access to the desired area is limited. Remote sensing by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> is a cost-effective and fast method for methane detection and monitoring, especially for vast and remote areas. This paper describes the integration of an off-the-shelf laser-based <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> into a multi-rotor UAV and demonstrates its efficacy in generating an aerial methane concentration map of a landfill. The UAV flies a preset flight path measuring methane concentrations in a vertical air column between the UAV and the ground surface. Measurements were taken at 10 Hz giving a typical distance between measurements of 0. 2 m when flying at 2 m/s. The UAV was set to fly at 25 to 30 m above the ground. We conclude that besides its utility in landfill monitoring, the proposed method is ready for other environmental applications {{as well as the}} inspection of natural gas infrastructure that can release methane with much higher concentrations...|$|E

Three experiments were carried out. First, the relationship between LMD and indirect open-circuit respiration calorimetric chamber measurements was tested. Sensitivity and specificity for cows were 95. 4 % and 96. 5 %. For sheep, sensitivity was 93. 8 % and specificity was 78. 7 %. Second, the effect of cow's activity on enteric methane emissions was investigated. During drinking and feeding, cows produced significantly more (p< 0. 001) methane emissions than when idle. Third, effect of different micrometeorological factors on LMD measurements under outdoor grazing conditions was investigated. Wind speed, relative humidity, pressure and wind direction relative to methane point-source had significant effect on methane measurements (p< 0. 001) under outdoor conditions.

40|$|A non-dispersive {{infrared}} (NDIR) {{methane gas}} sensor prototype {{has achieved a}} minimum detection limit of 1 parts per million by volume (ppm). The central idea of {{the design of the}} sensor is to decrease the detection limit by increasing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the system. In order to decrease the noise level, a single frequency filter algorithm based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted for signal processing. Through simulation and experiment, it is found that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the filter narrows with the extension of sampling period and the increase of lamp modulation frequency, and at some optimum sampling period and modulation frequency, the filtered signal maintains a noise to signal ratio of below 1 / 10, 000. The sensor prototype provides the key techniques for a hand-held <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> that has a low cost and a high resolution.

The {{emphasis is on}} the measurement procedure and the interpretation of the measurement rather than on the instrument itself. ] The failure to properly sample for methane is a major contributing factor to methane explosion risk. Sampling errors are most likely to occur at mines or tunnels where the presence of methane is not suspected or during nonroutine tasks at mines or tunnels known to have gas. More specific information on methane sampling at continuous miner sections is in Chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss sampling at longwall sections, and Chapter 14 discusses sampling at tunnels. METHANE DETECTORS FOR MINING Many models of gas detectors are {{available to}} measure methane concentrations, as well as most of the other contaminant gases found in mines and tunnels. An example is the iTX Multi-Gas Monitor, a portable gas detector available from Industrial Scientific Corp., Oakdale, PA. This handheld instrument measures several gases simultaneously.

40|$|Methane-rich fluid vents {{have been}} widely {{observed}} and associated to active faults in the Sea of Marmara, along the submerged portion of the North Ana- tolian Fault (NAF). Episodic gas seepage also occurs in the Izmit Gulf, along the NAF segment that ruptured during the 1999 Izmit earthquake. This site is thus a unique area {{to test the hypothesis}} on the relation between strike-slip deforma- tion, seismic activity and gas expulsion within an active fault zone. A long-term multi-parametric experiment can be an effective way to study the irregular dy- namics of gas emission from seafloor and to understand its possible relation with seismic activity. A benthic seafloor observatory (SN- 4) was deployed in the Izmit Gulf in 2009 using the R/V Urania as a demonstration mission in the framework of the EC ES- ONET (European Seas Observatory NETwork) project. Instrumental redundancy and specific cross-correlation of data from different sensors, proves to be funda- mental to distinguish actual seepage events from other signals related to ocean- ographic behaviour or even sensor biases. The observatory was equipped with a three component broad-band seismometer, a CTD with turbidity meter, two <b>methane</b> <b>detectors,</b> an oxygen sensor and a current-meter. All sensors installed on the observatory were managed by dedicated low-power electronics, which can manage a wide set of data streams with quite different sampling rates. A unique reference time, set by a central high-precision clock, is used to tag each datum. After six months of continuous monitoring, SN- 4 was recovered in March 2010 in order to download the data and replace the batteries for a further six month mission period and finally recovered in October 2010. The data analysis clearly shows frequent degassing events, recorded as methane anomalies in seawater and as high-frequency short-duration signals recorded by the seismometer [...] The time series of other oceanographic parameters (tempera- ture, oxygen concentration, turbidity and salinity) shows patterns that seem to be linked to both local gas seepage and to the circulation of water masses in the Gulf of Izmit.

The principal project goal was to develop means of deploying on an automotive platform an improved version of the handheld laser-based standoff natural gas leak detector previously developed by PSI and known as the Remote <b>Methane</b> Leak <b>Detector</b> or RMLD. A laser beam which interrogates the air for methane is projected from a spinning turret mounted upon a van. As the van travels forward, the laser beam scans an arc {{to the front and}} sides of the van so as to survey across streets and to building walls from a moving vehicle.

40|$|Methane is {{the most}} {{important}} of organic substance in the atmosphere, and its concentration significantly exceeds the concentration of other organic compounds. The contribution from methane to the greenhouse effect is about 30 % of that from carbon dioxide. On the global scale, natural sources of methane are wetlands, rice fields, cattle, biomass burning, as well as gas-hydrates. The discovery of natural methane gas-hydrates sparked the increased interest in gashydrates and was followed by a series of investigations, by which enormous fuel reserves were discovered in the form of gas-hydrates stored {{in the bottom of the}} world ocean. Gas-hydrates attract a lot of scientific attention, not only because they can be used as fuel and chemical raw material, but also in the context of possible emissions of the methane into the atmosphere. Gas-hydrate crystals in Lake Baikal have been found quite recently. Lake Baikal is a convenient object for the investigation of gas hydrates and of gas vents at the lake floor. The aim of this work was to find anomalies in the methane distribution in the atmosphere over Lake Baikal surface using a high-sensitivity laser <b>methane</b> <b>detector.</b> The <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> employs a GaInPAs diode laser as a source of radiation. The diode laser operates in the range from 6000 to 6080 cm- 1 (1. 645 - 1. 666 µm), which includes rather strong absorption lines of methane. The detector was calibrated by a nitrogen-methane mixture with a methane concentration of 2. 0 ppm. The detection limit (standard deviation) was 0. 037 ppm, and time constant of the <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> on the whole (with the allowance for the pump productivity and cell volume) was 99 s (spatial resolution of 450 m). The measurements of the methane content in the atmosphere over Lake Baikal were conducted by means of continuous air sampling from a height of 2 - 10 m above the water level from aboard R/V Vereshchagin in the periods of 10 - 16 August 2003 and of 16 - 24 June 2004. The coordinates of the measurement points were determined by the shipboard GPS system. Analysis of the data obtained in the course of the August 2003 expedition has shown that the methane concentration in near-surface air all along Lake Baikal averaged 2. 001 (0. 16) ppm; the standard deviation did not exceed 0. 2 ppm. A distinctive and considerable (5. 5 ppm) anomaly was observed near a shallow-water seep near the Selenga River inflow. Methane concentration distribution in near-surface air along the vessel’s track of 15 August 2003 showed a sharp peak that was limited in space and time. The average methane concentration in near-surface air over the South and Central Baikal Basins during the June 2004 expedition was 1. 91 (0. 07) ppm and distinctive and considerable (more than 2. 4 ppm) anomalies were observed at six areas in the Central Baikal Basin. Methane concentration distribution in near-surface air along the vessel’s tracks of 16 - 24 June 2004 was similar to the one obtained in 2003, with sharp peaks that were limited in space and time. Maximum air methane concentration (30 ppm) was detected near the Selenga shallow-water seep. In contrast to data obtained in August 2003 in the areas of visible methane escapes (Selenga River inflow and Babushkin village) groups of closely set methane escapes were observed. The distinctive and considerable (4 ppm) peak of the near-surface air methane concentration was observed near Mishicha, at a water depth of about 1000 m. The direct measurements of methane fluxes are very important for assessment of global fluxes of methane from water surface to the atmosphere. These measurements were carried out on vessel board for the first time. The most intensive fluxes (maximum methane flux was 2. 12 E- 9 kg/s m 2) were observed near Babushkin village, where also maximum values of methane concentrations in near-surface water were detected. The typical magnitude of methane flux in most areas was within the limits of 1 - 3 E- 12 kg/s m 2. We also observed small inverse metha...|$|E

A simplified method for determination of methane gas flux using laser <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> was considered to be effective to grasp the magnitude of methane flux. It was shown that the points those exhibited high value of methane gas flux also showed low EC-value compared with those of the other surround points. Furthermore, the low hardness of these points indicated that large amount of methane gas flux was caused by high permeability of surface as some stumps had been grown or as boundary between buried waste and ground line had been loosened. Measured fluxes for methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide in New-section ranged in < 0. 04 - 1800, 4. 9 - 1800, and < 0. 0001 - 0. 35 mL m- 2 min- 1, respectively.

40|$|Methane {{production}} by ruminants {{is a significant}} contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (Webb et al., 2013). However, current values used to estimate methane output by sheep are default values and do {{not take into account}} animal and dietary factors that may affect methane output (Bernstein et al., 2007). Strategies to reduce ruminant methane output are the focus of a large body of research (Iqbal et al., 2008) and, in order to implement these strategies fully, a greater understanding of factors that influence ruminant methane emissions is necessary. The "gold standard" method for measuring methane output by sheep is the use of respiratory chambers (Blaxter and Clapperton, 1965). However, this method is expensive, time-consuming and labour intensive, making it unsuitable for use in an on-farm situation. The work presented in this thesis explores the potential of three proxies to estimate methane output by sheep, which could be used or adapted {{to be used as a}} practical means of estimating methane emissions from sheep on a large scale.

With further development and validation, all three proxies presented in this thesis demonstrate potential to be used to successfully estimate or predict methane output by sheep as measured in respiratory chambers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to develop and demonstrate a cost-effective and power-efficient advanced standoff sensing technology able to detect and quantify, from a high-altitude (> 10, 000 ft) aircraft, natural gas leaking from a high-pressure pipeline. The advanced technology {{is based on an}} enhanced version of the Remote <b>Methane</b> Leak <b>Detector</b> (RMLD) platform developed previously by Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI). The RMLD combines a telecommunications-style diode laser, fiber-optic components, and low-cost DSP electronics with the well-understood principles of Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS), to indicate the presence of natural gas located between the operator and a topographic target. The transceiver transmits a laser beam onto a topographic target and receives some of the laser light reflected by the target. The controller processes the received light signal to deduce the amount of methane in the laser's path. For use in the airborne platform, we modified three aspects of the RMLD, by: (1) inserting an Erbium-doped optical fiber laser amplifier to increase the transmitted laser power from 10 mW to 5 W; (2) increasing the optical receiver diameter from 10 cm to 25 cm; and (3) altering the laser wavelength from 1653 nm to 1618 nm. The modified RMLD system provides a path-integrated methane concentration sensitivity {approx} 5000 ppm-m, sufficient to detect the presence of a leak from a high capacity transmission line while discriminating against attenuation by ambient methane. In ground-based simulations of the aerial leak detection scenario, we demonstrated the ability to measure methane leaks within the laser beam path when it illuminates a topographic target 2000 m away. We also demonstrated simulated leak detection from ranges of 200 m using the 25 cm optical receiver without the fiber amplifier...|$|R

Our lidar system uses 20 pulses at increasing wavelengths and integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) to map a methane line at 1650. 9 nanometers. The wavelengths are generated by using a Nd:YAG pump laser at 1064. 5 nanometers and distributed feedback diode laser at 1650. 9 nanometers and a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal. The pulse width was 3 nanoseconds and the pulse repetition rate was 6. 28 KHz. The outgoing energy was approximately 13 microJoules/pulse. A commercial 20 nanometer diameter fiber-coupled telescope with a photon counting detector operated in analog mode with a 0. 8 nanometer bandpass filter {{was used as the}} lidar receiver. The lidar system was integrated on NASA's DC- 8 flying laboratory, based at Dryden Airborne operations Facility (DAOF) in Palmdale CA. Three flights were performed in the central valley of California. Each flight lasted about 2. 5 hours and it consisted of several flight segments at constant altitudes at approximately 3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 6, 9. 1, 10. 6 km (l 0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 kft). An in-situ cavity ring down spectrometer made by Picarro Inc. was flown along with the lidar instrument provided us with the "truth" i. e. the local CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 O concentrations at the constant flight altitude segments. Using the aircraft's altitude, GPS, and meteorological data we calculated the theoretical differential optical depth of the methane absorption at increasing altitudes. Our results showed good agreement between the experimentally derived optical depth measurements from the lidar instrument and theoretical calculations as the flight altitude was increased from 3 to 10. 6 kilometers, assuming a constant methane mixing ratio of 1. 8 parts per million. The in-situ spectrometer did not show any significant deviations from the ambient concentrations. Further analysis using meteorological data from the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office ([URL] to derive the theoretical optical depth also showed good agreement with the experimentally derived values.

An improved technique has been developed that compliments traditional chamber based experiments to quantify the storage-scale release of methane gas to atmosphere through ebullition using the measurements from an Optical <b>Methane</b> <b>Detector</b> (OMD) and a robotic boat. This provides a conservative estimate of the methane emission rate from ebullition along with the bubble volume distribution. It also georeferences the area of ebullition activity across entire storages at short temporal scales. An assessment on Little Nerang Dam in Queensland, Australia, demonstrated whole storage methane release significantly differed spatially and throughout the day. Total methane emission estimates showed a potential 32 -fold variation in whole-of-dam rates depending on the measurement and extrapolation method and time of day used. The combined chamber and OMD technique showed that 1. 8 - 7. 0 % of the surface area of Little Nerang Dam is accounting for up to 97 % of total methane release to atmosphere throughout the day. Additionally, over 95 % of detectable ebullition occurred in depths less than 12 m {{during the day and}} 6 m at night.

40|$|Accurately {{quantifying}} total {{greenhouse gas}} emissions (e. g., methane) from natural systems such as lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands requires the spatial and temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive (bubbling) emissions. Ebullitive emissions exhibit high spatial and temporal variability and as such are difficult to measure. Traditional manual measurement techniques provide only limited localized assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. This is further exacerbated when whole-of-region estimates are developed for inclusion in global greenhouse gas inventories. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations by comparing two robot boat-based sampling systems with complementary sensing modalities to directly measure in real time the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways. The first system consists of a single Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) fitted with an Optical <b>Methane</b> <b>Detector</b> with algorithms to exploit the robot's mobility and transect repeatability for the accurate detection and quantification of methane bubbles across whole-of-system. The second system consists of multiple networked ASVs capable of persistent operation and scalable to whole-of-region monitoring. Each ASV carries a novel automated chamber-based gas sampling system to allow simultaneous real-time measurement of methane across the waterway. These ASV systems provide a foundation for persistent large-scale spatiotemporal sampling allowing scientists to develop whole-of-region greenhouse gas estimates and greatly improve global inventory budgets. An overview of the single and multi-robot sampling systems is presented, including their automated methane detection and sampling methodologies for the spatiotemporal quantification of greenhouse gas release to atmosphere. Experimental results are shown demonstrating each system's ability to autonomously navigate, detect, and quantify methane release to atmosphere across an entire inland reservoir...|$|E
30|$|Extensively raised {{beef cattle}} {{contribute}} to {{the highest levels of}} enteric methane (CH 4) gas emissions among all livestock. Expensive techniques and logistics hinder monitoring of such gas. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} use an inexpensive laser <b>methane</b> <b>detector</b> (LMD) apparatus to determine the enteric CH 4 levels from a herd of beef cows raised on semi-arid rangelands. A total of 24 cows were selected from Boran and Nguni cows (n =[*] 12 per breed) from two different farms. The parities of the cows were as follows: parity 1 (n[*]=[*] 6), parity 2 (n[*]=[*] 6), parity 3 (n[*]=[*] 6) and parity 4 (n[*]=[*] 6). An observer used a hand-held LMD to measure enteric CH 4 emissions plumes during the late afternoon hours when the animals were resting (either standing or lying down). Point measurements (expressed in ppm/m) were taken for six consecutive days and repeated once after every three months. The ratio of CH 4 output per kilogramme DMI was not different in within-breed and between-breed in both seasons. Generally, the dry season recorded the highest CH 4 output per kilogramme of live weight of cow. For example, Boran cows in parity 2 produced the highest output of 1.0 [*]±[*] 0.04  g CH 4 per kilogramme live weight of cow while Nguni cows in parities 1, 2 and 4 each produced 0.9 [*]±[*] 0.04  g CH 4 per kilogramme live weight of cow in the dry season. All the animals maintained optimal body condition scores in both seasons (ranging between the lowest of 3.2 [*]±[*] 0.01 and the highest of 3.4 [*]±[*] 0.01). Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that cows from both herds produced higher CH 4 per kilogramme live weight of cow in the dry season while maintaining optimal body condition scores in both seasons.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe polar regions of Mars offer a rich environment to search for signs of life. The Atromos probe was designed with the intent of investigating this polar region for evidence of life and to take atmospheric data in the harsh environment. The overall project was done as an example model and proof of concept for a small and affordable planetary probe capable of collecting scientific data used in life detection. Several key instruments were included such as a mass spectrometer, <b>methane</b> <b>detector,</b> gas chromatograph, and atmospheric characterization equipment. Some important components of the design were the ultra sonic drill, mechanical airbag system and deployable mast. The ultra sonic drill consists of a piezoelectric vibrator attached to a coring bit and a free mass. This drill can operate without external force applied and can bring back ice cores on the polar surface. The mechanical airbag system is an alternative method for touchdown in the EDL sequence. It minimizes the complexity and increases reliability of the probe surviving impact by utilizing spokes to absorb the impact. The deployable mast is used to enhance the atmospheric data collection by extending a series of temperature, pressure and anemometers to various distances above the surface. Notable subsystem work includes the power system and thermal regulation for operation on the planet. The power system consists of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator as well as solar panels that surround the probe. Power is stored in ultra capacitors and the probe operates on duty cycles when enough power is stored. The thermal regulation system consists of a sealed insulated box concealed within the probe. Inside the box are several radioisotope heating units to provide the warmth necessary for polar survival. System design, integration, testing and mock construction were performed on the various subsystems to determine feasibility and effectiveness. poster will be presented at the IPPW 6. The poster will show the system layout, integration and testing results for all the subsystems and equipment included on the probe. A mock model will accompany the poster to help visualize the scale and functionality of the probe. NASA, Ames Research Cente...|$|E
