5|$|<b>Melatonin</b> is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. <b>Melatonin</b> easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, <b>melatonin</b> does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. <b>Melatonin,</b> once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of <b>melatonin.</b> Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of <b>melatonin</b> during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding <b>melatonin</b> release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), <b>melatonin</b> (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or <b>melatonin</b> is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes <b>melatonin</b> at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible <b>melatonin</b> suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by <b>melatonin,</b> that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> {{might improve}} sleep in autistic people. Children with autism have {{abnormal}} <b>melatonin</b> pathways and below-average physiological levels of <b>melatonin.</b> <b>Melatonin</b> supplementation {{has been shown}} to improve sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and night-time awakenings. However, many studies on <b>melatonin</b> and autism rely on self-reported levels of improvement and more rigorous research is needed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>melatonin</b> receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are {{expressed}} in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, <b>melatonin</b> receptor 1 (MT1) and <b>melatonin</b> receptor 2 (MT2). <b>Melatonin</b> and <b>melatonin</b> receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types. The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated since 1986, yet is still not fully understood. When <b>melatonin</b> receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|Naturally-occurring <b>melatonin</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in foods including tart cherries to about 0.17–13.46ng/g, bananas and grapes, rice and cereals, herbs, plums, olive oil, wine and beer. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the <b>melatonin</b> binds to <b>melatonin</b> receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in <b>melatonin</b> such as banana, pineapple and orange, the blood levels of <b>melatonin</b> increase significantly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> {{appears to}} cause very few side effects as {{tested in the}} short term, up to three months, at low doses. Two {{systematic}} reviews found no adverse effects of exogenous <b>melatonin</b> in several clinical trials and comparative trials found the adverse effects headaches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness were reported about equally for both <b>melatonin</b> and placebo. Prolonged-release <b>melatonin</b> is safe with long-term use of up to 12 months.|$|E
25|$|A direct neurochemical {{relationship}} between sleep mechanisms and depression is another possibility. DSPD may cause excessive or inappropriate production of <b>melatonin.</b> Serotonin, a mood regulator, is the precursor of <b>melatonin.</b> As a result, increased endogenous <b>melatonin</b> production can deplete serotonin levels and may cause depression.|$|E
25|$|Studies in mice {{suggest that}} the pineal-derived <b>melatonin</b> regulates new bone deposition. Pineal-derived <b>melatonin</b> mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2 receptors. This pathway could be a {{potential}} new target for osteoporosis treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral <b>melatonin</b> treatment in a postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> is {{available}} as a prolonged-release prescription drug. It releases <b>melatonin</b> gradually over 8–10 hours, intended to mimic the body's internal secretion profile.|$|E
25|$|This {{antioxidant}} is {{a direct}} scavenger of radical oxygen and nitrogen species including OH•, O•2−, and NO•. <b>Melatonin</b> works with other antioxidants to improve the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. <b>Melatonin</b> has been proven to be twice as active as vitamin E, {{believed to be the}} most effective lipophilic antioxidant. An important characteristic of <b>melatonin</b> that distinguishes it from other classic radical scavengers is that its metabolites are also scavengers in what {{is referred to as the}} cascade reaction. Also different from other classic antioxidants, such as vitamin C and vitamin E, <b>melatonin</b> has amphiphilic properties. When compared to synthetic, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (MitoQ and MitoE), <b>melatonin</b> proved to be a comparable protector against mitochondrial oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> {{can lower}} follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Effects of <b>melatonin</b> on human {{reproduction}} remain unclear, {{although it was}} with some effect tried as a contraceptive in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>melatonin</b> {{drugs have}} not been tested for {{longitudinal}} side effects. Prolonged-release <b>melatonin</b> may improve quality of sleep in older people with minimal side effects.|$|E
25|$|While it {{is known}} that <b>melatonin</b> interacts with the immune system, the details of those {{interactions}} are unclear. Antiinflammatory effect seems to be the most relevant and most documented in the literature. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of <b>melatonin</b> in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete clinical trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought {{to be the result of}} <b>melatonin</b> acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, <b>melatonin</b> may enhance cytokine production, and by doing this, counteract acquired immunodeficiences. Some studies also suggest that <b>melatonin</b> might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{the primary}} {{function}} is regulation of day-night cycles. Human infants' <b>melatonin</b> levels become regular {{in about the}} third month after birth, with the highest levels measured between midnight and 8:00 am. Human <b>melatonin</b> production decreases as a person ages. Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of <b>melatonin</b> release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supplemental}} <b>melatonin</b> users {{report an}} increase in vivid dreaming. Extremely high doses of <b>melatonin</b> increased REM sleep time and dream activity in people both with and without narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, <b>melatonin</b> {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} by norepinephrine. Norepinephrine elevates the intracellular cAMP concentration via beta-adrenergic receptors and activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates the penultimate enzyme, the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). On exposure to (day)light, noradrenergic stimulation stops and the protein is immediately destroyed by proteasomal proteolysis. Production of <b>melatonin</b> is again {{started in the}} evening at the point called the dim-light <b>melatonin</b> onset.|$|E
25|$|As <b>melatonin</b> {{may cause}} harm in {{combination}} with certain medications {{or in the case}} of certain disorders, a doctor or pharmacist should be consulted before making a decision to take <b>melatonin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> {{can cause}} nausea, next-day grogginess, and irritability. In the elderly, {{it can cause}} reduced blood flow and hypothermia. In {{autoimmune}} disorders, evidence is conflicting whether <b>melatonin</b> supplementation may ameliorate or exacerbate symptoms due to immunomodulation.|$|E
25|$|Besides its {{function}} as synchronizer {{of the biological}} clock, <b>melatonin</b> is a powerful free-radical scavenger and wide-spectrum antioxidant. In many less-complex life forms, this is its only known function. <b>Melatonin</b> is an antioxidant that can easily cross cell membranes and the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin,</b> {{also known}} as N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine, is a hormone that is {{produced}} by the pineal gland in animals and regulates sleep and wakefulness. <b>Melatonin</b> is also produced in plants where it functions as a {{first line of defense}} against oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|While the {{packaging}} of <b>melatonin</b> often warns against use in people under 18 years of age, available {{studies suggest that}} <b>melatonin</b> is an efficacious and safe treatment for insomnia in people with ADHD. However, larger and longer {{studies are needed to}} establish long-term safety and optimal dosing.|$|E
25|$|Both {{animal and}} human {{studies have shown}} <b>melatonin</b> to protect against radiation-induced {{cellular}} damage. <b>Melatonin</b> and its metabolites protect organisms from oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species which are generated during exposure. Nearly 70% of biological damage caused by ionizing radiation {{is estimated to be}} attributable to the creation of free radicals, especially the hydroxyl radical that attacks DNA, proteins, and cellular membranes. <b>Melatonin</b> {{has been described as a}} broadly protective, readily available, and orally self-administered antioxidant that is without major known side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melatonin</b> in {{comparison}} to placebo is effective for reducing preoperative anxiety in adults when given as premedication. It may be just as effective as standard treatment with midazolam in reducing preoperative anxiety. <b>Melatonin</b> may also reduce postoperative anxiety (measured 6 hours after surgery) when compared to placebo.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for <b>melatonin</b> in treating insomnia is generally poor. There is low quality {{evidence that it}} may speed the onset of sleep by 6 minutes. Ramelteon, a <b>melatonin</b> receptor agonist, {{does not appear to}} speed the onset of sleep or the amount of sleep a person gets.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin at {{a dose of}} 25mg/day for 3weeks {{has been}} found to {{decrease}} cortisol levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase <b>melatonin</b> production by 26% in healthy volunteers. In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal <b>melatonin</b> deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose doxepin was found to restore <b>melatonin</b> levels to near-normal values after 3weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be involved in the beneficial effects of doxepin on sleep and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|During the night, <b>melatonin</b> regulates leptin, {{lowering}} its levels.|$|E
25|$|The human pineal gland {{grows in}} size until about 1–2 years of age, {{remaining}} stable thereafter, although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. The abundant <b>melatonin</b> levels in children {{are believed to}} inhibit sexual development, and pineal tumors have been linked with precocious puberty. When puberty arrives, <b>melatonin</b> production is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants {{and other}} {{substances}} {{are known to}} interact with <b>melatonin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hypoestrogenism and <b>melatonin</b> supplementation {{increase}} cortisol {{levels in}} postmenopausal women.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that <b>melatonin</b> is an antioxidant {{was made in}} 1993.|$|E
