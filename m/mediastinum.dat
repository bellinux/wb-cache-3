5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the <b>mediastinum</b> and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the <b>mediastinum</b> (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|The artery has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior <b>mediastinum</b> to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the <b>mediastinum</b> behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the <b>mediastinum,</b> through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the <b>mediastinum,</b> the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the <b>mediastinum</b> is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the <b>mediastinum</b> and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and <b>mediastinum</b> (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the <b>mediastinum</b> of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
25|$|Chest {{radiography}} may {{demonstrate a}} change in the morphology of the thoracic aorta which can be seen in aortic dissection. Classically, new widening of the <b>mediastinum</b> on radiograph is of moderate sensitivity for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this finding is of low specificity, as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the <b>mediastinum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chest {{radiograph}} {{may show}} air-fluid level in <b>mediastinum.</b> Pott's disease and calcified aneurysms of aorta {{can be easily}} diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasonography and CT scan are {{not very}} useful in finding cause of dysphagia; but can detect masses in <b>mediastinum</b> and aortic aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Lymph nodes are {{particularly}} numerous in the <b>mediastinum</b> in the chest, neck, pelvis, axilla, inguinal region, and {{in association with}} the blood vessels of the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Ganglioneuromas most {{frequently}} {{occur in the}} abdomen, however these tumors can grow anywhere sympathetic nervous tissue is found. Other common locations include the adrenal gland, paraspinal retroperitoneum, posterior <b>mediastinum,</b> head, and neck.|$|E
25|$|Sites of {{spread of}} {{medullary}} thyroid carcinoma include local lymph nodes in the neck, lymph nodes {{in the central}} portion of the chest (<b>mediastinum),</b> liver, lung, and bone. Spread to other sites such as skin or brain occurs but is uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Access is {{gained through}} a left lateral {{thoracotomy}} incision below the sixth rib. The inferior <b>mediastinum</b> {{is exposed to}} the level of the anterior aspect of the descending aorta. All of the shunting veins that direct blood to the collateral veins from the esophagus are ligated, taking special consideration to preserving the extraesophageal systemic venous collaterals (azygous veins). Usually between 30-50 shunting veins are present. Once devascularization is complete, the esophagus is clamped in two areas with esophageal clamps, and esophageal transection is done at the level of the diaphragm. The anterior muscular and mucosal layers are divided, but the posterior layer is left intact. Sutures are then placed and the divided varices are occluded. The muscle layer is then reattached. A nasogastric tube is left in situ, and the <b>mediastinum</b> is closed.|$|E
25|$|Seminoma (also {{known as}} pure seminoma or {{classical}} seminoma) is a germ cell tumor of the testicle or, more rarely, the <b>mediastinum</b> or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a malignant neoplasm {{and is one}} of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.|$|E
25|$|Appropriate {{penetration}} of the film can be assessed by faint visualization of the thoracic spines and lung markings behind the heart. The right diaphragm is usually higher than the left, with the liver being situated beneath it in the abdomen. The minor fissure can sometimes {{be seen on the}} right as a thin horizontal line {{at the level of the}} fifth or sixth rib. Splaying of the carina can also suggest a tumor or process in the middle <b>mediastinum</b> or enlargement of the left atrium, with a normal angle of approximately 60 degrees. The right paratracheal stripe is also important to assess, as it can reflect a process in the posterior <b>mediastinum,</b> in particular the spine or paraspinal soft tissues; normally it should measure 3mm or less. The left paratracheal stripe is more variable, and only seen in 25% of normal patients on posteroanterior views.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of diving {{barotrauma}} {{depends on}} the symptoms. Lung over-pressure injury may require a chest drain to remove air from the pleura or <b>mediastinum.</b> Recompression with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for arterial gas embolism, as the raised pressure reduces bubble size, low inert gas partial pressure accelerates inert gas solution and high oxygen partial pressure helps oxygenate tissues compromised by the emboli. Care must be taken when recompressing to avoid a tension pneumothorax. Barotraumas that do not involve gas in the tissues are generally treated according to severity and symptoms for similar trauma from other causes.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the first}} good {{description}} of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described accurately the vestibule {{in the interior of}} the temporal bone. He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named ductus venosus. He described the omentum, and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views {{of the structure of the}} pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the <b>mediastinum</b> and pleura and the fullest {{description of the}} anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He did not understand the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh.|$|E
25|$|Radiographic {{examinations}} involve {{radiation exposure}} {{in the form}} of X-rays. Although barium ions are toxic, their use is generally regarded as safe because the small amounts of barium ions available in solution and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract are deemed to be negligible; however, isolated cases of barium encephalopathy have been described following absorption of barium from the intestinal tract. Constipation and abdominal pain may occur after barium meals. The formation of baroliths, which may need to be removed surgically, is a complication of the use of barium sulfate. Barium sulfate may cause serious peritoneal irritation. Leakage of Barium sulfate into the abdominal cavity may occur in people with duodenal ulcers or other perforations and may lead to peritonitis, adhesion, and granulomas; it is associated with a high mortality rate. Leakage of barium into the <b>mediastinum</b> or peritoneal cavity may lead to endotoxic shock, which is often fatal; as a result, the use of barium as a contrast agent is contraindicated when there is a suspicion or possibility of compromise of bowel wall integrity. Aspiration or inhalation of barium sulfate into the lungs during oral application can lead to serious respiratory complications leading to fatal aspiration pneumonia or asphyxiation. Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are rare but some additives contained in barium preparations may induce immune reactions. Complete gastrointestinal obstruction is also a contraindication for barium studies.|$|E
500|$|Air is able {{to travel}} to the soft tissues of the neck from the <b>mediastinum</b> and the retroperitoneum (the space behind the {{abdominal}} cavity) because these areas are connected by fascial planes. [...] From the punctured lungs or airways, the air travels up the perivascular sheaths and into the <b>mediastinum,</b> from which it can enter the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E

500|$|The {{human heart}} is {{situated}} in the middle <b>mediastinum,</b> {{at the level of}} thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the <b>mediastinum.</b> The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels – the venae cavae, [...] aorta and pulmonary trunk. The upper part of the heart is located {{at the level of the}} third costal cartilage. The lower tip of the heart, the apex, lies to the left of the sternum (8 to 9cm from the midsternal line) between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages.|$|E
500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} {{is frequently}} found in pneumothorax (air {{outside of the}} lung in the chest cavity) and may also result from air in the <b>mediastinum,</b> pneumopericardium (air in the pericardial cavity around the heart). [...] A tension pneumothorax, in which air builds up in the pleural cavity and exerts pressure on the organs within the chest, makes {{it more likely that}} air will enter the subcutaneous tissues through pleura torn by a broken rib. [...] When subcutaneous emphysema results from pneumothorax, air may enter tissues including those of the face, neck, chest, armpits, or abdomen.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally a plain {{radiograph}} of the chest, ideally {{with the}} X-ray beams being projected {{from the back}} (posteroanterior, or [...] "PA"), {{has been the most}} appropriate first investigation. These are usually performed during maximal inspiration (holding one's breath); no added information is gathered by obtaining a chest X-ray in expiration (after exhaling). If the PA X-ray does not show a pneumothorax but there is a strong suspicion of one, lateral X-rays (with beams projecting from the side) may be performed, but this is not routine practice. It is not unusual for the <b>mediastinum</b> (the structure between the lungs that contains the heart, great blood vessels and large airways) to be shifted away from the affected lung due to the pressure differences. This is not equivalent to a tension pneumothorax, which is determined mainly by the constellation of symptoms, hypoxia, and shock.|$|E
500|$|The {{first report}} of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema resulting from {{air in the}} <b>mediastinum</b> was made in 1850 in a patient who had been coughing violently. [...] In 1900, the first recorded case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a bugler for the Royal Marines who had had a tooth extracted: playing the instrument had forced air through the hole where the tooth had been and into the tissues of his face. [...] Since then, another case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a submariner for the US Navy who had had a root canal in the past; the increased pressure in the submarine forced air through it and into his face. In recent years a case was reported at the University Hospital of Wales {{of a young man}} who had been coughing violently causing a rupture in the esophagus resulting in SE. [...] The cause of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was clarified between 1939 and 1944 by Macklin, contributing to the current understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition.|$|E
500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the <b>mediastinum,</b> the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise. [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of air leak into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, {{and the sound of the}} voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{common in}} young adults, often arises in the <b>mediastinum</b> or {{cervical}} lymph nodes ...|$|E
2500|$|Only {{the left}} common carotid artery has a {{substantial}} {{presence in the}} thorax. [...] It originates directly from the aortic arch, and travels upward through the superior <b>mediastinum</b> {{to the level of}} the left sternoclavicular joint.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cases of}} seminoma can present {{as a primary}} tumour outside the testis, most {{commonly}} in the <b>mediastinum.</b> [...] In the ovary, the tumor is called a dysgerminoma, and in non-gonadal sites, particularly the central nervous system, it is called a germinoma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} for lymphoma in ferrets {{depends on their}} health {{and the location of}} the cancer. [...] Lymphoma in the <b>mediastinum,</b> spleen, skin, and peripheral lymph nodes has the best prognosis, while lymphoma in the intestine, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow has the worst.|$|E
2500|$|Lymphoma {{is common}} in ferrets and {{is the most common}} cancer in young ferrets. [...] There is some {{evidence}} that a retrovirus {{may play a role in}} the development of lymphoma like in cats. [...] The most commonly affected tissues are the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestine, <b>mediastinum,</b> bone marrow, lung, and kidney.|$|E
