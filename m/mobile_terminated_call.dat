5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem). It can also {{be defined as a}} directory number temporarily assigned to a mobile for a <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> <b>call.</b> A MSRN is assigned for every <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> <b>call,</b> not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{methods for}} {{location}} area code (LAC) planning in mobile networks require prediction values of the expected signaling traffic (paging, location update, etc.) {{that have to be}} provided by traffic and mobility models. Modeling can be based on a learning data set consisting of geographic information (population distribution, land use) as input data and performance measurement values from the operations and maintenance center (OMC) as output data. In this paper, the performance of fast modeling methods based on classification and regression trees (CART) is investigated and compared to linear regression analysis. It will be shown that a combination of these two methods shows modeling results of arbitrary accuracy. The analysis of the modeling performance is carried out by comparing the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> (MTC) prediction values with OMC measurement values from a real network...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{telecommunication}} to meet demanding end user requirements in terms of quality of experience and service, different protocol specifications have been defined ranging from GSM to WCDMA and now LTE which includes LTE-Advanced. Specifications of these protocols are being revised on a frequent basis and thus bringing more challenges at development side. For the development teams, tracking and analyzing the cause of failure in protocol stacks is a daunting task and consumes valuable engineering resources {{where they have to}} use conventional debugging methods. One widely used conventional method till now is to generate logs and ask an expert to analyze and interpret issues against protocol specifications by scanning through hundreds of lines of traces. This master thesis describes an implementation of a Generic Log Analyzer which can ease the analysis of logs generated across the fields. The experiment to verify the validity of the log analyzer was done using two different log formats. The first one was a formal and consistent format and most of the information was coded. It was learned that the log analyzer can point out missing signals/messages from the scenarios in log files after decoding the log messages. Two scenarios were selected for formal file format, namely Mobile Originated Call and <b>Mobile</b> <b>Terminated</b> <b>Call</b> from 3 GPP specifications. The second selected file format was informal and inconsistent because there was no standard defined format for log entries and one log file can have multiple types of message formats. It was learned that the log analyzer not only filtered out required messages but also reports problematic areas in the selected scenario where the mobile phone transitions from one to another state frequently. The scenario selected for the informal type of format was “Power on” of a mobile device as per defined in the 3 GPP specifications. After the experiments were conducted, it was learned that such a tool can be extended to domain specific rules to add more intelligence if the rule framework was provided for the end user. Thus, such a tool can not only consolidate experience at a single place and help intended users to find minor to advanced level problems in the log files. It can also act as a watchdog to ensure system quality by reporting level of test coverage based on finding scenarios from logs generated during the system test.

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{challenges}} faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase {{of the number of}} subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Companies evaluate their products’ performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load; powerful solutions are hence needed for generating traffic and modeling various telecom protocols. In this paper, we propose a new traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator loads the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, mobile <b>call</b> originating, <b>mobile</b> <b>call</b> <b>terminating,</b> and <b>call</b> clearing.

40|$|Telecommunication {{applications}} {{have become}} {{some of the}} most important aspects of our daily life, especially with the Internet-based applications that are available even on cell phones. One of the challenges faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase of the number of subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Telecom companies evaluate their products' performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load. To do this, powerful solutions are needed, which generate traffic by modeling different telecom protocols. In this thesis, we propose a new technique of modeling a traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator is modeled to load the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, mobile <b>call</b> originating, <b>mobile</b> <b>call</b> <b>terminating,</b> and <b>call</b> clearing. Based on that, we model the Radio Access Network Application Part protocol' procedures to generate the radio access messages that carry and handle the mobile messages. These mobile messages will be represented through the Mobility Management and the Call Control protocols' models. To achieve the above goals, we utilize the UML Use Case Model to describe the functional behaviors of the traffic generator, also we present the UML Analysis Model that provides the logical implementation of the functional behaviors of the proposed traffic generator...|$|R

40|$|The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) attempted, in late 1999, to {{introduce}} the calling party pays (CPP) regime for mobile cellular services, with a corresponding revenue-sharing arrangement between fixed and mobile operators. According to the revenue-sharing proposal, mobile operators in India were to be compensated for carrying traffic {{to and from the}} fixed networks. Under their original license conditions, fixed operators (usually one of the two state-owned incumbents) were not paying <b>mobile</b> operators for <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> on their networks. However, mobile operators had to compensate the state-owned incumbent for terminating traffic. This unfavourable environment for mobile operators has meant that mobile services {{have not been able to}} reach their full potential in India. There was great disappointment within the mobile industry when the TRAI's CPP order was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in early 2000, due to lack of jurisdiction. Since then, the enabling legislation has been amended. It is hoped that the new provisions of the TRAI Act will empower the regulator to establish a level playing field for mobile network operators. It is only through the creation of a suitable framework for interconnection that the TRAI will be able to ensure the success of telecommunications reform in India.

The tariff charges can range from R0.50 to R30.00 on mobile originated billing and from R0.50 to R50.00 using <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> billing. Due to high costs associated with short code rental many providers offer shared shortcodes, which greatly reduces costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{accounting}} rate system currently in place {{is used to}} reimburse telephone companies {{around the world for}} <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> originating in foreign countries. Increased competition in more liberalized countries has led to imbalances between traffic originating in these countries and traffic coming in from less liberalized countries, leading to huge settlement payments being made to less liberalized countries. Some variation in {{accounting rate}}s across countries can be explained by traditional factors such as the actual cost of <b>terminating</b> <b>calls.</b> Our results suggest that accounting rates are also significantly affected by non-traditional factors such as the extent of government regulation, the level of corruption, and the like. These findings support the need for consideration of these factors in reforming the accounting rate system currently in place. “High settlement rates are a product of oligopolistic cooperation in a market with little transparency and anti-competitive regulation in the majority of nations” [Cowhey, 1998; p. 908].

40|$|Abstract ⎯ We {{investigate}} the statistical properties of both originated and <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> arrivals in sets of real GSM telephone traffic data (TIM, Italy), emphasizing results {{obtained by the}} Modified Allan Variance (MAVAR), a widely used timedomain quantity with excellent capability of discriminating power-law noise. The call arrival rate exhibits a diurnal trend, with peak hours {{in the morning and}} late afternoon. Besides this diurnal change, the number of call arrivals in a second is found perfectly uncorrelated to the number of arrivals in other seconds and Poisson distributed, with good consistency by χ 2 -test evaluation. Uniform and accurate whiteness of call arrivals per second is verified in all hours, regardless the time of the day. In all series analyzed, the empirical statistics of both originated and <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> arrivals proved excellent consistency with the ideal Poisson model with variable rate λ(t). This study may be valuable to researchers concerned about realistic modelling of traffic in planning and performance evaluation of cellular networks.
