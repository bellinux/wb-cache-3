50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} an all-fabric inflatable aircraft was based on Taylor McDaniel inflatable rubber glider experiments in 1931. Designed and built in only 12 weeks, the Goodyear Inflatoplane was built in 1956, {{with the idea that}} it could be used by the military as a rescue plane to be dropped in a hardened container behind enemy lines. The 44 cubic ft (1.25 cubic <b>meter)</b> <b>container</b> could also be transported by truck, jeep trailer or aircraft. The inflatable surface of this aircraft was actually a sandwich of two rubber-type materials connected by a mesh of nylon threads, forming an I-beam. When the nylon was exposed to air, it absorbed and repelled water as it stiffened, giving the aircraft its shape and rigidity. Structural integrity was retained in flight with forced air being continually circulated by the aircraft's motor.|$|R

40|$|Several {{facilities}} at Argonne National Laboratory - West (ANL-W) generate many thousand gallons of radioactive liquid waste per year. These waste streams {{are sent to}} the AFL-W Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility (RLWTF) where they are processed through hot air evaporators. These evaporators remove the liquid portion of the waste and leave a relatively small volume of solids in a shielded container. The ANL-W sampling, characterization and tracking programs ensure that these solids ultimately meet the disposal requirements of a low-level radioactive waste landfill. One set of evaporators will process an average 25, 000 gallons of radioactive liquid waste, provide shielding, and reduce it to a volume of six cubic <b>meters</b> (<b>container</b> volume) for disposal. Waste characterization of the shielded evaporators poses some challenges. The process of evaporating the liquid and reducing the volume of waste increases the concentrations of RCIU regulated metals and radionuclides in the final waste form. Also, once the liquid waste has been processed through the evaporators {{it is not possible}} to obtain sample material for characterization. The process for tracking and assessing the final radioactive waste concentrations is described in this paper, The structural components of the evaporator are an approved and integral part of the final waste stream and they are included in the final waste characterization...|$|R

5000|$|Despite the {{objections}} of Murdoch's associates that his so-called [...] "gasometer" [...] was not a <b>meter</b> but a <b>container,</b> the name was retained and came into general use. The term [...] "gasometer" [...] is discouraged for use in technical circles, where the term [...] "gas holder" [...] is preferred. The British Ordnance Survey have marked gas holders on their large-scale maps- calling them gasometers. This became used to label gas works, where there usually are several gas holders.|$|R
50|$|Toyist Dejo (founder of Toyism) came up {{with the}} idea of {{painting}} the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company Essent (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 <b>meter</b> high gas <b>container.</b> On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} is {{an emerging}} technology for destruction of dilute air contaminants {{that is currently}} under commercial development, which using TiO 2 as photocatalyst. UV illumination of the TiO 2 film placed in a gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO) / air container resulted in the total degradation of formaldehyde to CO 2 and H 2 O. Despite its potential advantages, the key unresolved issues in the commercial application of photocatalytic oxidation technologies to contaminated air purification are that of optimum photocatalytic reactor design and the load of photocatalyst. In this paper, successive alternating banks of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths are mounted directly in a square duct. The photocatalyst TiO 2 was loaded {{on the surface of}} honeycomb monoliths by different methods. The square duct including banks of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths was put in a 4 cubic <b>meters</b> glass <b>container.</b> The polluted gas was injected into the container. The photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants was studied. The results shown that the air contaminants formaldehyde can be degraded by photocatalytic oxidation technology. The photocatalytic efficiency was different photo-initiated by UV lamps with peak wavelength at 254 nm and 365 nm. The distance between the UV lamps bank and the honeycombs monoliths was found to affect the efficient of photodegradation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{determine}} the spatial pattern of Aedes aegypti and the containers {{in which they}} develop in two neighborhoods of the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru. Four variables were examined: adult Ae. aegypti, pupae, con-tainers positive for larvae or pupae, and all water-holding containers. Adults clustered strongly within houses and weakly to a distance of 30 meters beyond the household; clustering was not detected beyond 10 <b>meters</b> for positive <b>containers</b> or pupae. Over {{short periods of time}} restricted flight range and frequent blood-feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti appear to be underlying factors in the clustering patterns of human dengue infections. Permanent, consistently infested con-tainers (key premises) were not major producers of Ae. aegypti, indicating that larvaciding strategies by themselves may be less effective than reduction of mosquito development sites by source reduction and education campaigns. We conclude that entomologic risk of human dengue infection should be assessed at the household level at frequent time intervals...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{identify}} and provide information on the waste package and disposal facility concepts {{to be used for}} the low-level waste tank interim performance assessment. Current concepts for the low-level waste form, canister, and the disposal facility will be used for the interim performance assessment. The concept for the waste form consists of vitrified glass cullet in a sulfur polymer cement matrix material. The waste form will be contained in a 2 {times} 2 {times} 8 <b>meter</b> carbon steel <b>container.</b> Two disposal facility concepts will be used for the interim performance assessment. These facility concepts are based on a preliminary disposal facility concept developed for estimating costs for a disposal options configuration study. These disposal concepts are based on vault type structures. None of the concepts given in this report have been approved by a Tank Waste Remediation Systems (TWRS) decision board. These concepts will only be used in th interim performance assessment. Future performance assessments will be based on approved designs...|$|R
50|$|The 9K38 Igla (NATO {{reporting}} name is S-18 Grouse) is a 72.2 mm man-portable {{air defense}} missile weighing 10.6 kilograms with a 1.3 kilogram warhead. The missile itself is 1.67 <b>meters</b> long, the <b>container</b> is 1.708 <b>meters</b> {{and the whole}} system weights 17 kilograms. The system is designed to engage fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, cruise missiles and UAVs flying at speeds of 360-400 m/s in head-on engagement (approaching target) and up to 320 m/s in tail chase (receding target) within their optical visibility and in the night-time conditions in background clutter and thermal countermeasures environment. The system uses thermal battery/gas bottle, and is armed with a high-explosive warhead fitted with a contact and grazing fuse. The missile has a maximum range of 5200 meters and operates at altitudes from ten and up to 3500 meters. The 9M39 missile SA-18 employs an IR (infrared) guidance system using proportional convergence logic. The new seeker offers better protection against electro-optical jammers; the probability of kill against an unprotected fighter is estimated at 30-48%, {{and the use of}} IRCM jammers only degrades this to 24-30%.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Iowa State University Hinds Irrigation Farm, Ames, IA during the summers of 1997 and 1998 to compare the Bt and non-Bt versions of two maize (Zea mays, L.) hybrids. The plants were grown in buried, one <b>meter</b> deep, <b>containers</b> filled with a Nicollet loam (Aquic Hapludoll) soil. A rainout shelter protected the plots from the interruption of water deficit by rainfall. Irrigation was scheduled so that the plants experienced water deficit during the peak egg hatch {{of the first and}} second European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) generations. Water deficit during the vegetative period delayed leaf appearance and tasseling, reduced the area of individual leaves and plant height, but did not affect total leaf number. Thermal time requirement per leaf was different for the two years due to the interactive effect of photoperiod and cool temperatures. The lowest grain yields were observed when water deficit was imposed around tasseling. Biomass yield was lowest with vegetative period water deficit, {{but there was also a}} significant reduction when water deficit was imposed during the reproductive period. The amount of stalk tunneling by corn borer larvae was not different between water deficit treatments, but Bt plants had significantly less tunneling by the second-generation larvae than non-Bt plants. Stressed and non-stressed plants differed significantly in leaf temperature, stomatal conductance and sap flow, but Bt and non-Bt plants did not. It was concluded that the introduction of the Bt gene into maize plants for a better resistance to European corn borer did not affect their water relations. Transpiration measured by the sap flow technique was well correlated with Penman potential evapotranspiration, suggesting that this method is more suitable than porometry or infrared thermometry for plant transpiration measurements under varying environmental conditions. A stress index was derived from transpiration measured 15 to 18 days after silking which could be used as a simple yield forecasting tool by decision makers...|$|R
