40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the optimal {{monetary}} policies recommended by New Keynesian models still imply {{a large amount of}} inflation risk. We calculate the term structure of inflation uncertainty in New Keynesian models when the monetary authority adopts the optimal policy. When the monetary policy rules are modified to include some weight on a price path, the economy achieves equilibria with substantially lower long-run inflation risk. With either sticky prices or sticky wages, a price path target reduces the variance of inflation by an order of magnitude more than it increases the variability of the output <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R

40|$|Output gaps for 11 EU countries, the US and Japan are {{constructed}} based {{on measures of}} potential output derived from a CES production function. This production function accommodates differences in substitution elasticities between countries. Indeed, the empirical evidence shows that real wage elasticities of labour demand differ widely across countries. The national output gaps constructed turn out to significantly explain future changes in inflation. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that an aggregate European output gap significantly precedes aggregate European inflation, as well as inflation in the individual EU countries. These findings imply that an aggregate European output gap may serve as an inflation indicator for the preparation of a single European <b>monetary</b> policy. output <b>gap,</b> potential output, inflation, Phillips curve...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the recent financial crisis, central banks around the world, including the Bank of Canada, have provided markets with extraordinary levels of liquidity. As the economic recovery takes hold, the question arises of what the increased liquidity, through higher money growth, portends for the near future. The supply of and demand for money carries information on the outlook for inflation and economic growth. Current evidence suggests a rebound in economic growth and inflationary pressure unless the Bank begins to rein in money growth. The Bank of Canada should provide some guidance on its thinking on the behaviour of monetary and credit aggregates and what it entails for inflation and economic growth.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} recent {{events in the}} euro area to discuss the serious gaps in the fiscal {{architecture}} of the European Economic and <b>Monetary</b> Union. These <b>gaps</b> stem {{from the lack of}} a fiscal federation and the incapacity of EU institutions to effectively enforce the set of rules supposed {{to make up for the}} absence of a fiscal principal. The failure of preventive instruments made the absence of crisis management and resolution capabilities in the euro area highly problematic, exposing the union to a meaningful risk of breakup. To conclude, we draw the lessons of the euro sovereign debt crisis in terms of improving the euro area?s fiscal architecture and, more broadly the fiscal framework required for the sustainability of other monetary unions without fiscal unions.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of macroeconomic policies depends on adequate business cycle approximation. Given that potential output and the output gap (the difference between actual and potential output) {{are not directly}} observable, their values need to be estimated using alternative statistical, structural, and combined techniques. In this paper the Hodrick-Prescott filter and the Cobb-Douglass production function has been applied on the Slovak conditions. The pross and coins of both methods are analysed. The Hodrick-Prescott filter does not capture the structural changes, which were significant especially {{in the first half}} of analysed period. Thus the Cobb-Douglass production function seems to be more appropriate. It enables to detect particular factors of potential output growth as technological progress, capital and labour. Despite of potential shortcomings, this approach is still widely used by international institutions, governments and researchers. <b>monetary</b> policy, output <b>gap,</b> potential output, Hodrick-Prescot filter, Cobb-Douglas production funct...|$|R
40|$|For the {{successful}} conduct of monetary policy {{the central bank}} needs reliable indicators of the monetary policy stance. A recently often advocated one is {{the gap between the}} real, market and the natural rate of interest. In this article we estimate the historical time series of the natural rate of interest using a structural vector autoregressive model. This method returns plausible results and thus seems to be well designed for the estimation of the natural rate of interest. We show that the natural rate exhibits quite substantial variability over time, of comparable magnitude to the variability of the real interest rate. We also find that it is a procyclical variable. We conclude that the gap between the natural and real market interest rates can be considered a useful, although not perfect, indicator of the stance of monetary policy.

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{importance}} and final {{success of the}} convergence process {{that led to the}} establishment of the European Monetary Union, there is no clear agreement regarding the monetary policy pursued in the member countries during the convergence process. This paper contributes to the literature with an empirical analysis of the period from 1993 to 1998 that encompasses eleven EMU countries. In particular, Taylor type interest rate rules are estimated with monthly national data to find that, despite certain similarities and exceptions, the rule followed by each country is distinct and differs substantially from the standard Taylor rule. However, for most countries, the parameter estimates reflect the principles proclaimed by the monetary policy authorities and, in addition, it is shown that in most cases the estimated rules reproduce the policy setting quite closely.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the monetary policymaker’s joint problem of model estimation {{and the design}} of a policy rule in the face of uncertainty regarding the process of structural change in the economy. Unobserved structural change is modeled through time variation in the natural rates of interest and unemployment. I show that certainty-equivalent optimal policies perform poorly when there is uncertainty about the natural rate processes. I then examine the properties of combined estimation methods and policy rules that are robust to this type of model uncertainty. I find that weighted sample means are robust estimators of natural rates for the purpose of setting policy. The optimal policy under uncertainty incorporates a significant degree of policy inertia and a muted response to the perceived unemployment gap; by comparison, the certainty-equivalent optimized policy in this model exhibits little policy inertia and a more aggressive response to the unemployment <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy; Econometric models...|$|R

It studies fiscal and monetary policy interactions and their role in stabilisation of the economy using a small-scale model following the methodology outlined in Lubik and Schorfheide (2007). The general features of the model can be summarised as follows : Calvo style nominal price rigidities, perfect exchange rate pass-through, complete international asset markets, rule of thumb price setters and distortionary taxation. The parameter estimates show that the monetary authority reacts to inflation but only weakly reacts to the output gap. The degree of interest rate smoothing is high.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the voting {{patterns}} of internal and external members of the MPC to investigate how far {{there are differences between}} insiders and outsiders. We make three contributions. First, we assess {{the extent to which the}} Bank of England internally generated forecasts explain the MPC members' voting decisions. This is important as generating forecasts on a quarterly basis is a key part of the process used by the Bank of England. The forecast for inflation is made public in the Inflation Report while the output gap forecast is not. Second, we use a random coefficient method of estimation in which the parameters of the interest rate rule are allowed, but not required, to be different across members. Third, we find evidence of some heterogeneity in the intercept, a measure of experience on the MPC and the interest rate smoothing parameter, but no significant differences in the members' reaction to the forecasts of inflation and the output <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> Policy; Voting Patterns...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{that many}} of the exaggerated claims that globalization has been an important element in the reduction of the inflation in the recent years do not come true. The globalization has, however, the potential to contribute to the stabilization of economies and this has been crucial element in promoting the growth of economies. The paper, therefore, analyzes four issues on the impact of the globalization upon the mechanisms of monetary transmission and arrives at the following findings. (1) Globalization did not reduce the sensibility of inflation to the domestic production gaps and in consequence to the effectiveness of the <b>monetary</b> policy,. (2) <b>Gaps</b> in the product of external economies do not play a more important role than in other times,.

40|$|In this paper, we {{model the}} policy stance of the People¡¦s Bank of China (PBoC) as a latent variable, and the {{discrete}} {{changes in the}} reserve requirement ratio, policy interest rates, and the scale of open market operations are taken as signals of movement of this latent variable. We run a discrete choice regression that relates these observed indicators of policy stance to major trends of macroeconomic and financial developments, which are represented by common factors extracted from {{a large number of}} variables. The predicted value of the estimated model can then be interpreted as the implicit policy stance of the PBoC. In a second step, we estimate how much of the variation in the PBoC's implicit stance can be explained by measures of its policy objectives on inflation, growth and financial stability. We find that deviations of CPI inflation from an implicit target and deviations of broad money growth from the announced targets figured significantly in PBoC's policy changes, but not output <b>gaps.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy, People's Bank of China, qualitative response models, large factor models...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a survey of}} recent theoretical and empirical works analyzing the implications of imperfect information about potential output {{for the conduct of}} monetary policy. Using small-scale New Keynesian models, most of these studies conclude that, under optimal <b>monetary</b> policy, output <b>gap</b> uncertainty leads to persistent deviations between the actual and the perceived output gap in response to supply and cost-push shocks. As a consequence, the monetary policy stance turns out to be systematically looser than under perfect information in periods of large reductions in potential output, and overly restrictive relative to this benchmark in periods of large expansions in potential output. Although these previous studies shed light on the economic mechanisms by which the imprecise measurement of potential output may affect the policy behavior and thus, the dynamics of inflation, their quantitative findings depend on the assumptions about the information set available to the policymaker. In this respect, a useful role for unit labor costs emerges. This indicator provides information about potential output, and it strongly improves the central bank’s ability to make stabilization policy more effective. monetary policy, potential output uncertainty, indicator variables, real unit labor costs...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy with respect to output gap fluctuations in the Republic of Macedonia during the period 1991 - 2009. We use two different fiscal policy measures: 1) the cyclically unadjusted primary budget balance and 2) the cyclically adjusted primary budget balance as a proxy indicator of the fiscal policy stance. This analysis also aims to explore whether there was a substantial change in the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 due to the turbulent initial period of transition and the switch in monetary policy strategy. We additionally control for other factors that also seem to have had a significant impact over the fiscal policy behavior, such as the armed conflict in 2001 and the impact of public debt as a proxy indicator of budget financing constraints. The estimated results with respect to both measures, the cyclically unadjusted and cyclically adjusted budget balance, indicate differences in the fiscal policy behavior prior to and after 1996. More precisely, the results imply that the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 was procyclical, whereas afterwards the fiscal policy became countercyclical. These results are robust to different measures of the output gap and different frequency of the data sets. fiscal policy, cyclically adjusted balance, output <b>gap,</b> <b>monetary</b> policy change...|$|R
40|$|The study proposes econometric {{tests for}} {{examining}} whether the theoretical divergences between {{the space of}} «capabilities» {{and that of the}} «utility» have, in practice, some importance. Based on the household survey of Burkina Faso carried out by 1994 - 95, the empiricalanalysis arrives at three conclusions. Firstly, a measure of poverty based on the monetaryexpenditures has, to a certain extent, the capacity to capture important dimensions of thewellbeing suggested by the approach of the rights, in particular, access to adapted educationaland health levels, and to adequate conditions of housing and sanitary environment. Secondly, thestudy shows the opportunity of a micro-multidimensionalmeasure of the deprivation of certainrights as an approximation of monetary poverty. On the one hand, the approach of the rightssuggests a proximity of situations between the configuration of the non-monetary poverty,apprehended by the micro-multidimensional index, and the profile of monetary poverty. On theother hand, the binary Probit, Tobit and ordered Probit estimates show that the role of theattributes related to housing, sanitary environment and instruction is essential in theexplanation, not only of the ratio and the <b>monetary</b> poverty <b>gap,</b> but also of the classificationof the households according to the per capita expenditures. However, taking into considerationof the nutrition leads to more contrasted conclusions. Thirdly, the empirical tests tend,nevertheless, to support the idea – and the theoretical argumentation – that the coexistence oftwo «spaces» introduces essential additional information in terms of evaluation of poverty andpromotion of human development. Three principal effects explain this conclusion: (i) an effectof level – the sensibility of the access to capabilities is related to the level of householdexpenditures; (ii) an effect of structure – the relation between the standard of living of thehouseholds and the access to the capabilities is complicated by the heterogeneity of the ruraland urban sectors, and the social institutions; (iii) an effect of eviction – for example, therelative non-access of girls to education or to an adequate nutrition grows with the per capitadepenses, especially in the rural sector. Consequently, if the increasing availability of themonetary resources of the households are a major determinant of human development, theapproaches of the capabilities and utility are more complementary than opposed, and it would beprobably economically and socially ineffective to want to completely substitute one for theother.

40|$|Paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} individual reactions functions of Polish Monetary Policy Council (MPC) members in the years 2004 – 2005. In the period under study the Polish central bank (National Bank of Poland) used the bias in the monetary policy {{as an indicator of}} future interest rate movements and a change of bias without a change in the short-term interest rate resulted in shifts of the yield curve comparable to those which accompanied changes in the short-term interest rate. For that reason as a monetary policy instrument in the reaction functions we use a qualitative variable, which expresses the direction of change in the restrictiveness of the monetary policy proposed by the given member of the MPC (the change of bias and/or change of central bank short-term interest rate). Taking into account the qualitative nature of the dependent variable, we employ the ordered logit model, where several variants of the reaction functions are tested. The results of the research indicate {{that the majority of the}} Polish MPC members acted forward looking rather then backward looking. The classical Taylor’s backward looking reaction function has been rejected by the data for most MPC members. Moreover the substitution of the lagged inflation by the future inflation improved the quality of the all considered models. On the other hand in the forward looking reaction function with the inflation expectations formulated for 12 months ahead the variable expressing the expectations has been significant in 6 out of 7 individual functions. The research has been completed by the sensitivity analysis of the behaviour of the MPC members against changes in the current and future inflation and changes in the output <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy, policy rules, reaction function, ordered logit model...|$|R
50|$|The {{main cause}} of the gap is {{considered}} to be expansionary monetary policies carried out by the government. An inflationary gap is a signal that the economy is in the boom part of the trade cycle, resources are being used over their capacity, factories are operating with increasing average costs; wage rates increase because labour is used beyond normal hours at overtime pay rates. A case of the gap can arise when consumer or investor spending is very buoyant, when foreign demand is increasing or when government expenditure increases. According to some economists, such a situation arose in the United States in 1999-2000 and 2006-2007, when the unemployment rate was below 5%. Wages increase {{as a result of the}} increase in aggregate demand which in turn raises business costs. This leads to an increase in prices (inflation) and these higher prices reduce consumer purchasing power, causing aggregate demand to fall and the output gap to close. When the gap is finally eliminated, equilibrium is achieved, with actual GDP equal to potential GDP but at a higher price level. Economists warn that this is not an auto mechanism. Government action in the form of fiscal and monetary policies is a must to close the <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy can be used to contract the money supply in the economy by raising interest rates, which would reduce purchasing power, resulting in falling demand. Keynes, however, was not in favour of monetary methods. He suggested a method of progressive taxation, where the collections from the taxes would be saved and used once equilibrium is achieved in the economy, which he called 'forced savings' Another method is to cut transfer payments and subsidies, thus cutting down consumption.|$|R
