40|$|As the psychrometric {{method is}} {{considered}} {{standard for the}} measurement of relative humidity, many studies have used aspirated thermocouple psychrometers connected to microloggers but, however, they do not detail how the aspiration of the air stream is done. However, {{one of the major}} difficulties of aspirated thermocouple psychrometers is to program and to connect it in micrologger, because specific programming and connection are requires, and still some skills in getting accurate measurements. This work aimed to provide the programming and the connection of the aspirated thermocouple psychrometer type T for the CR 10 X microloggers and CR 23 X of Campbell Scientific, evaluating the quality of measurements of temperature and air relative humidity in relation the a sensor Vaisala HMP 50. The non-continuous measurements were made in the period 2006 / 09 / 04 to 2007 / 07 / 11 at Jaboticabal, SP. The air temperature measurements were similar between the Vaisala sensors and aspirated thermocouple psychrometer, but the relative humidity measurements were significantly different. The measurements obtained by the aspirated thermocouple psychrometer connected to CR 10 X micrologger were the most accurate. Using the programming and connection of a <b>micro-fan</b> to suck in the dry and moist bulbs of aspirated thermocouple psychrometer in microloggers models CR 10 X and CR 23 X, it is possible to obtain measurements of air temperature with good precision and accuracy, and measurements of air relative humidity with good precision, but accuracy is not always attainable due to the difficulties inherent to the physical processes that occur in the wet bulb, the skill in the use and maintenance of this equipment and the reservoir protection against radiative effects...|$|E
40|$|Technological advancement, {{as well as}} {{consumer}} demands, has {{motivated the}} miniaturization of electronic/mechanical systems and increase of device power and performance. The notebook computer is not an exception, and innovative thermal management solutions must be employed {{to compensate for the}} increased heat dissipation in the space-constrained enclosures. The majority of current cooling systems in laptop computers rely on heat pipes attached to a remote heat exchanger with <b>micro-fans</b> providing forced convection to reject heat to the ambient, however this technique can not accommodate the increasing heat fluxes in the confined laptop enclosure. In this study, a two-phase closed loop cooling system is designed and tested for a laptop computer. The cooling system consists of an evaporator structure containing boiling structures connected to a compact condenser with mini fans providing external forced convection. A pump is also incorporated to assist the return of the condensate back to the evaporator. The cooling system is characterized by a parametric study which determines the effects of volume fill ratio of coolant, initial system pressure, and pump flow rate on the thermal performance of the closed loop. Experimental data shows the optimum parametric values which can dissipate 25 W of chip power with a chip temperature maintained at 95 C. Numerical analysis provides additional data to further enhance the heat dissipation from the external air-cooled side of the condenser by studying the effects of ventilation and air flow rate across the system. Thermal management of mobile systems must be considered during the early design phases, and this research shows the feasibility of implementing of a two-phase cooling system to dissipate 25 W in a laptop computer.
