5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have <b>made</b> <b>any</b> grants of arms.

5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided {{to stay on the}} defensive along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side <b>made</b> <b>any</b> offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E

5|$|Jon Coghill (born 26 August 1971) is an Australian drummer {{best known}} for his work with Australian rock band, Powderfinger, {{although}} he has also toured with Regurgitator. Coghill replaced Powderfinger's original drummer Steven Bishop in 1991 when Bishop wanted to pursue further studies. At this time, Powderfinger had not <b>made</b> <b>any</b> recordings, and as such, Coghill has been the group's drummer for all of their releases.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty <b>made</b> <b>any</b> {{provision}} as to {{the mode}} or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison {{became ill}} with a cold. According to the {{prevailing}} medical misconception of that time, {{it was believed that}} his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule <b>made</b> <b>any</b> rest time scarce.|$|E

5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael <b>made</b> <b>any</b> trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E

5|$|The melody of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully <b>made</b> <b>any</b> methodical calculations when he composed the melody.|$|E
5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare <b>made</b> <b>any</b> direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing.

Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither <b>made</b> <b>any</b> progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E
5|$|U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and {{out into}} the Atlantic.

5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D.

However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never <b>made</b> <b>any</b> effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have <b>made</b> <b>any</b> adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
