5|$|Portia labiata is a {{jumping spider}} (family Salticidae) found in Sri Lanka, India, {{southern}} China, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, Singapore, Java, Sumatra and the Philippines. In this medium-sized jumping spider, the front part is orange-brown {{and the back}} part is brownish. The conspicuous main eyes provide vision <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> than a cat's {{during the day and}} 10times <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> than a dragonfly's, and this is essential in P. labiata′s navigation, hunting and mating.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and are <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> {{than those}} of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking {{it from the}} north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became <b>more</b> <b>acute.</b> Guderian wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E

25|$|Food {{intolerance}} is <b>more</b> chronic, less <b>acute,</b> {{less obvious}} in its presentation, and often {{more difficult to}} diagnose than a food allergy.|$|R
5|$|Thunderstorms {{began to}} form again just before midday, as the {{hot and humid}} {{conditions}} became <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> in the middle part of the day. The Bureau of Meteorology radar picked {{up a series of}} cells to the north-west of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and the data suggested that there was a possibility of large hail. The Bureau immediately issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the coastal region between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, 100km to the north.|$|E
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E

5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and <b>more</b> <b>acute,</b> and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>acute</b> {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers <b>more</b> <b>acute.</b>|$|E
50|$|Symptoms may be briefly <b>acute</b> or a <b>more</b> {{prolonged}} but <b>acute</b> or chronic, relapsing or remitting. Asymptomatic conditions {{also exist}} (e.g. subclinical infections and silent diseases like sometimes, high blood pressure).|$|R
25|$|In these rare, <b>more</b> severe <b>acute</b> cases, {{patients}} {{have been successfully}} treated with antiviral therapy {{similar to that used}} in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.|$|R
5000|$|Before joining AFI on November 2, 1998, Jade Puget {{played in}} various bands, {{including}} Loose Change and Redemption 87. His first album with AFI was 1999's Black Sails in the Sunset. The first song {{he wrote for}} the band was [...] "Malleus Maleficarum". Puget's addition to the band introduced fans to a <b>more</b> melodically <b>acute</b> and dynamic sound that was vastly different from earlier material.|$|R
5|$|The {{divisions}} in the Labour Party became <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> during 1931, as the government struggled to meet the May Report's recommended expenditure cuts of £97 million, the majority (£67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs. On 23 August 1931 the government collapsed. To implement the required cuts, MacDonald and {{a small number of}} Labour MPs formed a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals, while the bulk of the Labour Party, including Wilkinson, went into opposition. In the general election that followed in October the Labour Party was utterly routed, retaining only 52 of its parliamentary seats. In Middlesbrough East Wilkinson's vote was nearly the same as her 1929 total, but against a single candidate representing the National Government she was defeated by over 6,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move {{the university}} to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became <b>more</b> <b>acute,</b> the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer the university to Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E

30|$|Postoperative {{complications}} {{developed in}} 70 of the 275 patients. Among those with complications, 25 patients suffered two or <b>more</b> complications. <b>Acute</b> kidney injury {{was the most}} common complication and occurred in 38 patients. Pulmonary congestion and pneumonia developed in 19 and 21 patients, respectively. Additionally, arrhythmias developed in 8 patients and liver dysfunction developed in 5 patients. Neurologic complications were rare and transient ankle jitteriness or headache developed in 3 patients.|$|R

5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns <b>more</b> <b>acute.</b> On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{component}} of Árbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill {{himself with the}} help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 17 June 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers, who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own. Árbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the shortage of capital <b>more</b> <b>acute.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{instances}} of optic neuritis and myelitis were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity.

5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an elongate, two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the elongate metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, may end in a small hypoconulid. A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> angle), the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial cingulum is strong.|$|E
25|$|Like other jumping spiders, it has vision <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> than a cat and {{ten times}} <b>more</b> <b>acute</b> than a dragonfly.

25|$|Goblet cell carcinoids are a {{class of}} rare tumors that form {{as a result of}} an {{excessive}} proliferation of both goblet and neuroendocrine cells.
