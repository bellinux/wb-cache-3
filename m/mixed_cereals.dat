40|$|The {{influence}} of different diets (Tetramin dry fish food, frozen spinach, and Dieterba <b>mixed</b> <b>cereals</b> for babies) on survival, fecundity and sex ratio was examined {{in a population}} of the polychaete Dinophilus gyrociliatus. Specimens were collected in the harbour of Genoa and were studied under controlled laboratory conditions. In D. tyrociliatus sex determination is progamic; a single ovary produces eggs of two sizes, the small eggs develop into dwarf males and the large ones into females. Sex determination is chromosomal with male heterogamety of the XO/XX type, and therefore a 1 : 1 population sex ratio is expected. The results of the experiment revealed that diet significantly influenced survival, fecundity and also the sex ratio. With all diets the maximum lifespan was about the same, but after 10 weeks of experiments the percentage of survivors was 9 % with Tetramin, 35 % with spinach and 39 % with cereals. Fecundity was different in relation to diet; females fed with Tetramin produced {{the maximum number of}} eggs. The greater and earlier mortality with the Tetramin diet could be related to the greater fecundity seen in this group, in that, the greater amount of energy allocated to the production of gametes may have reduced the percentage of individuals surviving to maximum age.

40|$|Background: Cereals {{have been}} {{extensively}} advocated as the beneficial food group {{in terms of}} body weight management, but each staple cereal crop may contribute in different ways. Studies of the association between wheat availability and risk of obesity are controversial. This study aimed to test the global and regional association between wheat availability as reported by FAO and obesity prevalence at a population level. FAO does not distinguish between whole grain wheat and refined wheat. Methods: Population-specific data from 170 countries on prevalence of obesity, availabilities of <b>mixed</b> <b>cereals,</b> wheat, rice, maize, meat, sugar, fat, soy and calories and GDP are obtained from the UN agencies. All variables were measured as per capita per day (or per year). Each country is treated as an individual subject. SPSS v. 22 is used to analyse these data for all the 170 countries and official country groupings (regions) using non parametric and parametric correlations, including partial correlation analysis. Results: Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis showed that obesity prevalence is positively associated with wheat availability (r = 0. 500, p < 0. 001), but is inversely associated with availabilities of total cereals (r = - 0. 132, p = 0. 087), rice (r = - 0. 405, p < 0. 001) and maize (r = - 0. 227, p = 0. 004). These associations remain in partial correlation model when we keep availabilities of meat, fat, sugar, soy, caloric intake and GDP statistically constant. Overall, positive associations between wheat availability and obesity prevalence remain in different regions. Maize and mixed cereal availabilities do not show independent associations with the obesity prevalence. Conclusions: Our study suggests that wheat availability is an independent predictor of the obesity prevalence both worldwide and with special regard to the regions of Africa, Americas and Asia. Future studies should distinguish between possible influence of whole grain and ultra-processed refined wheat products...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{agricultural}} intensification {{has led to}} well-documented {{declines in}} the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, <b>mixed</b> <b>cereals,</b> linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options {{in the margins of}} intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe...|$|E

Linearity, in the working standards solutions, between 12. 5 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL, was good (r 2 = 0. 998). Linearity in the matrix-matched assay, prepared between 20 and 250 μg/Kg, was r 2 = 0. 997. Matrix-effect was 92. 5 %. Recovery values ranged between 97. 6 and 105. 3 %, and precision between 2 and 13. 6 %. The accuracy and precision results {{comply with the requirements}} established by the EC directive 401 / 2006. LOD and LOQ were 3. 75 and 12. 5 μg/Kg, respectively. The application of the procedure to 50 samples from the three cities showed that 36 % of the samples were contaminated. One sample with baby flour purpose exceeded the maximum limit established by EC legislation of 2007, and another one was close to the limit. A maize flour sample exceeded the ML established by EC with a concentration of 111. 7 μg/kg.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of T- 2 toxin and HT- 2 toxin in cereals and baby food was validated by collaborative study. In short, the method is as follows: A test portion of a sample is extracted {{with a mixture of}} methanol/water (80 / 20, v/v). This raw extract is then diluted, filtered, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. After washing and elution with acetonitrile the eluate is evaporated to dryness. T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins in the dry residue are then derivatised with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamid (MSTFA) / Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (99 / 1, v/v), injected into a gas chromatograph, and detected and quantified by mass spectrometry. 14 laboratories from 10 different countries were selected to participate in the collaborative study. They received 6 different test materials as blind duplicates. The test materials consisted of a blank <b>cereal</b> <b>mix,</b> two <b>cereal</b> <b>mixes</b> naturally contaminated at different levels, a blank baby food, and two baby foods naturally contaminated at different levels. Furthermore, two blank <b>cereal</b> <b>mixes</b> and two blank baby foods together with specific spiking solutions were provided for recovery determination. The sum of the mass fractions of T- 2 & HT- 2 after spiking were 50 µg/kg in the <b>cereal</b> <b>mix,</b> and 25 µg/kg in the baby food. Reported recoveries in the <b>cereal</b> <b>mix</b> ranged from 87 to 127 % for the sum of T- 2 & HT- 2 with a mean value of 107 %. Reproducibility relative standard deviations (RSDR) for the cereal matrix were 19 % at a natural contamination level of ca. 32 µg/kg, 11 % at ca. 79 µg/kg, and 12 % for the spiked material at 50 µg/kg. For baby food the recovery values ranged from 91 to 127 % with 116 % for the mean value.

40|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{pastoral}} societies are governed by internal rules or legal bodies and legal rules (institutions) at the regional and national scale. In the Large Scale Grazing Systems (LSGS) of the European Union (EU), institutional management is also dependent on EU regulations, which underpin a considerable part of total policy support. In this research we argue that the effectiveness of policy intervention should be determined "on the ground" and taking into account the structural and social features of particular LSGS. Under a community-based research approach, the main stakeholders (arable farmers and landless pastoralists) and organisations governing the cereal-sheep farming system in Castilla-La Mancha (South-Central Spain) were consulted with the aim of assessing the sustainability of the <b>mixed</b> <b>cereal</b> and sheep system. In this area, sheep farming is a secondary land use relying on the agricultural residues from arable farming, but representing some 35 % of the total value of production farming per land unit. Our results showed that regional and EU regulations are uncoordinated and uncongenial for the continuity of the <b>mixed</b> <b>cereal</b> and sheep operation. They are supported by separate policy schemes, while operating on the same land units. Arable farming is more affected by EU regulations and corresponding policy support schemes, while sheep farming is more regulated by regional institutions. EU support was 32 % and 13 % of total farm income for cereal and sheep farmers, respectively. Arable farmers received a regulated non-market grazing fee. They abide by the law, but have no incentive to facilitate the sheep subsystem. The farming practices of sheep farmers are more market-driven as the value of production makes up the bulk of their total income. However, they are squeezed by strict regional regulations when implementing pastoral surviving strategies (mobility, accessibility, and diversity of land based resources). Both subsystems are following disconnected trends, with increasing cultivation intensity in arable farming and the abandonment of shepherding and a consequent consolidation of sheep flocks and an increase in indoor feeding. This research suggests that sensible institutional management should be derived from a proper knowledge of the social and structural features of particular grazing systems and the disentangling of their main constraints.

5000|$|A variety called café de cebada ("coffee of barley" [...] in Spanish) is {{available}} in Latin American markets, though it is often more of a roasted barley tea than a coffee-like beverage. Instant roasted barley drinks are sold under various brand names (although {{most of them are}} made with a <b>mix</b> of <b>cereals,</b> not only barley) such as Caro (Europe, New Zealand), Pero (Switzerland, US) and Barleycup (UK), among others. Recently, actual Italian ground roasted barley has begun to be imported into the US by Café Orzo and UK by Orzo Coffee.|$|R
