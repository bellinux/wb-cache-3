At various times, the governors of each of the three states have met, but these meetings have resulted only in deadline extensions for agreement. When U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar visited Georgia in 2009, he said that he would not force the states into any agreement, but he would help them come to an agreement.|$|E

25|$|Calgary Power had {{problems}} before this dam {{was completed in}} 1911. The Bow River originates from a northern mountain, and its flow varies considerably depending upon the amount and location of winter snowfalls. A comprehensive study of the Bow's flow measurements had not been conducted. In its operations, Calgary Power relied upon estimates of the river's <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> during winter conditions. Thus, despite {{the amount of energy}} the company had contracted, it could not reliably fulfill these obligations during winters. With capital already invested in Horseshoe, Calgary Power opened another hydroelectric plant and reservoir two years later on the Bow's tributary, Kananaskis River. A reservoir was also created within Banff National Park in 1912 at Lake Minnewanka. Despite this additional reservoir and both plants, Calgary Power still struggled to fulfill its power contracts during winter months. In the 1920s, the company began planning new projects to control the Bow River.|$|E

Operating at lower flows will {{extend the life of}} the pipeline as well as increasing profit for its owners. The 2012 flow of 600,000 bbd is significantly less than what the pipeline was designed for. Low flowrates require that the oil move slower through the line, meaning that its temperature drops more than in high-flow situations. A freeze in the line would block a pig in the line, which would force a shutdown and repairs. A 2011 engineering report by Alyeska stated that, to avoid freezing, heaters would need to be installed at several pump stations. This report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350,000 bbd, but it did not attempt to determine the absolute minimum. Other studies have suggested that the minimum is 70,000 100,000 bbd with the current pipeline. Alyeska could also replace the 48" [...] pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks with a 20" [...] pipeline and use rail the rest of the way, which would allow as little as 45,000 bbd.|$|E
