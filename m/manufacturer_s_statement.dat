(2010) used sheets fabricated from a single manufacturer (FRP system M) and (McGuirk and Breña 2012) used sheets from two different manufacturers (FRP systems F and S). Unidirectional carbon fiber sheets bonded formed by wet layup were used in all cases. The published tensile strength, rupture strain, and elastic modulus of a 1 -ply cured fiber-reinforced sheet from manufacturer M are 830  MPa, 1.67  %, and 49.3 GPa, respectively. Similarly the published tensile strength, rupture strain, and modulus of a 1 -ply cured sheet from <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> are 849  MPa, 70.5  GPa, and 1.12  %; and those for manufacturer F are 875  MPa, 72.4  GPa, and 1.2  %, respectively.

40|$|In Standing Committee on Discipline of the United States District Court for the Central District of California v. Yagman, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{held that}} an {{attorney}} who publicly criticized a federal judge did not commit sanctionable conduct. In determining whether the attorney, Stephen Yagman, had violated a local {{rule of professional conduct}} for lawyers, the court applied a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 2 standard, rather than a subjective malice standard. The court held that Yagman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements,</b> in light of this higher standard, did not violate the rule 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition against impugning the integrity of the court. The Ninth Circuit also held that the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements</b> did not violate the rule 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition against attorneys interfering with the administration of justice.

Ben Lilly was charged with being the triggerman, and Barker testified to that effect at Ben 2 ̆ 7 s trial. Mark did not testify.

40|$|This Essay {{provides}} {{a solution to}} the conundrum of statements made by very young children and offered against an accused in a criminal prosecution. Currently prevailing doctrine allows one of three basic outcomes. First, in some cases the child testifies at trial. But this is not always feasible, and when it is, cross-examination is a poor method for determining the truth. Second, evidence of the child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statement</b> may be excluded, which denies the adjudicative process of potentially valuable information. Third, the evidence may be admitted without the child testifying at trial, which leaves the accused with no practical ability to examine the child. We contend that courts should apply a very different framework. Some very young children lack the cognitive and perhaps moral development necessary to be considered witnesses for purposes of the Confrontation Clause; they are unable to understand the potential consequences of their statements and the significance of those statements. Accordingly, the Confrontation Clause should not apply to very young children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements.</b> But a child who makes such a statement is still the source of evidence, often very probative evidence. Fundamental fairness therefore requires that the accused have the opportunity to examine the child in some manner. Such examination should not be cross-examination at trial. Rather, it should adhere to the model used for nonhuman sources of evidence: the accused should be able to select a qualified forensic interviewer, who will examine the child out of court according to a prescribed protocol. In this Essay, we outline standards that such a protocol might provide. This model allows evidentiary use of the child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statement,</b> gives the accused a better opportunity than does cross-examination to expose weaknesses in the child 2 ̆ 7 s account, and minimizes trauma to the child...|$|R
