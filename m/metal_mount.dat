50|$|Unlike the 14-42mm, the 14-45mm has a <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> and {{hardware}} OIS switch. The front elements extend upon zooming, {{but do not}} rotate, allowing consistent use of polarized filters. The 52mm filter diameter lets a user share common filters with the Panasonic 14-42mm and 45-200mm, but not the 14-140 or 100-300mm.|$|E
50|$|Canon {{introduced}} the EF 50mm 1.8 STM on May 10, 2015. This lens utilizes Canon's STM focusing motor, which supports the Movie Servo autofocus mode.STM abbreviates as Stepping Motor. The lens features a <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> {{and has a}} rounded seven-blade aperture. Its filter diameter of 49mm is the smallest among all lenses in the family.|$|E
5000|$|First {{introduced}} in 1987, {{it is the}} oldest lens in Canon's current lineup (...) that is still available new. The lens is constructed with a plastic body and <b>metal</b> <b>mount,</b> and features a distance window with infrared index and magnification markings. The optional Life-Size Converter EF adapts the lens to produce a maximum magnification of 1:1. Attaching the converter increases the lens focal length to 70mm, reduces the maximum aperture to 3.5 and limits the focal range. Magnification markings for the converter are shown on the (extending) inner lens barrel.|$|E

50|$|A bayonet lug is a {{standard}} feature on most military muskets, rifles, and shotguns, and on some civilian longarms. It is intended for attaching a bayonet, which is typically a long spike or thrusting knife. The bayonet lug is the <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> that either locks the bayonet onto the weapon or provides a base for the bayonet to rest against, so that when a bayonet thrust is made, the bayonet does not move or slip backwards. Less than 400 years ago, bayonet lugs or their predecessors {{that allowed them to}} slip over the barrel did not exist.|$|E
50|$|The EF 35 mm 2 is an enthusiast-level lens. Like the {{original}} version of the 2 lens, it has a plastic body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount,</b> but adds image stabilization. It also has an eight-blade diaphragm with rounded blades, {{as opposed to the}} eight non-rounded blades of the 1.4L lens and the five non-rounded blades of {{the original}} 2 model. This lens features a distance window with infrared index. The optical construction of this lens contains 10 elements in 8 groups, including one molded aspherical element. It uses a ring-type USM motor. The front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing.|$|E
50|$|The EF 85mm 1.8 USM is a {{consumer}} level lens. It is the shorter sister to the EF 100mm 2.0 USM, {{and is designed}} very similarly. It is constructed with a plastic body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> This lens features a distance window with infrared index. An 8 blade, maximum aperture of 1.8, gives this lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 9 lens elements, without any special lens elements. It uses an internal focusing system (meaning that the front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing), powered by a ring type USM motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is very fast.|$|E

40|$|Diamond knives {{for cutting}} thin {{sections}} for electron microscopy were first introduced by Ferngndez-Mor~n (1) {{and have been}} perfected subsequently by him (2). Such knives, as distributed, are embedded {{by means of a}} special alloy in a rectangular <b>metal</b> <b>mounting</b> which usually measures 11 x 4. 5 x 1. 5 mm. (2). A holder for the <b>metal</b> <b>mounting,</b> complete with collecting trough, has been described (2), but it was designed primarily for the Ferngndez-Mor/m microtome and cannot be fitted directly to microtomes intended for use with g'ass knives. In view of the recent increase in availability of diamond knives of the Fern/mdez-Mor~n type, it appeared desirable to have a holder for the meta...|$|R
50|$|The EF 35 mm 1.4L USM is a {{professional}} L series lens. It is constructed with a plastic body and <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> The screw-on filter thread at the front is metal. Features of this lens are a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, and a distance window with infrared index. The maximum aperture of 1.4 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth of field and smooth bokeh effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 11 lens elements in 9 groups, including one ground and polished aspherical lens element. It uses a rear floating focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Autofocus speed of this lens is very fast, and the front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing.|$|E
50|$|The EF 35 mm 2 is a {{prosumer}} level lens. It {{is constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> This lens features a distance window with infrared index. The maximum aperture of 2 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects, but not to the same shallowness of the EF 35 mm 1.4L USM, while its five-blade diaphragm may produce background blur (bokeh). The optical construction of this lens contains seven lens elements, without any special lens elements. It uses a linear extension focusing system, powered by an AFD motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is moderately fast, but focusing does make some sound. The front of the lens does not rotate when focusing, but does extend.|$|E
5000|$|The commercially made Unilens Monocular is a {{convenient}} pocket size. Its <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> can be clipped onto a wooden pole {{in a manner}} somewhat reminiscent of the [...] "selfie stick" [...] used with today's cameras, onto any kind of similar [...] "pole" [...] (trekking pole, etc..), or even to an umbrella tip. Original instructions advise the user to sit with the arm holding the device resting on the knee and to move the lens forward and back until the desired object is in focus. Normally this is when the lens is held about 4 feet from the user's eye. Magnification increases as {{the distance from the}} eye increases further than 4 feet, until fully extended to 6 feet, at which point the maximal 4-times magnification is reached but with some image blurring at that stage.|$|E

50|$|The Sigma 150mm 2.8 APO Macro EX DG HSM is a consumer-level macro lens. It is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> This lens features a distance window with magnification scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 2.8 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} very shallow depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 16 lens elements, including two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) elements. This lens uses an inner focusing system, powered by a ring type HSM motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is slow in absolute terms, being a macro lens it is not as fast as most ring HSM lenses. However, it remains very decent for a macro lens. The front of the lens does not rotate nor extend when focusing. This lens is compatible with Sigma teleconverter lenses.|$|E
50|$|The EF 50mm 1.4 USM is a consumer- and professional-level lens. It is {{the least}} {{expensive}} 1.4 aperture lens that Canon currently manufactures. It is constructed with a plastic body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> This lens features a distance window with infrared index. An 8-blade diaphragm and maximum aperture of 1.4 give this lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 7 lens elements including 2 high refraction elements, but no aspherical, high dispersion or calcium fluoride elements. The lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a micro USM motor. Even though this lens uses a micro USM motor, it still has FTM (full-time manual focus) available. Auto-focus speed of this lens is fast, but not as quick as most ring-USM-based lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but extends by up to about one centimeter when focusing.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> This lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth-of-field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens elements, including one aspherical lens element. This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer body barrel is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.|$|E

50|$|The 18-50mm 2.8 EX DC Macro is a consumer-level lens. It is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a <b>metal</b> <b>mount.</b> The lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A 7-blade, maximum aperture of 2.8 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects. The optical construction of the lens contains 15 lens elements, including two aspherical lens elements, one SLD (Special Low Dispersion) element, and one ELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) element. The lens uses an internal focusing system, powered by a micro motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is moderate, but because of its focal length, auto focus time is not long. The front of the lens does not rotate, but the focusing ring does, when using auto focus. The lens uses an extending inner lens barrel when zooming, this allows a more compact design, and does not rotate while zooming.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> RFID tag that works reliably on metallic surfaces. The method proposes {{the use of}} commercial label type RFID tags with 2. 5 mm thick Styrofoam 103. 7 with a relative permittivity of 1. 03 attached {{on the back of}} the tag. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, we performed experiments on an electric transformer supply chain system. The experimental results showed that the proposed tags can communicate with readers from a distance of 2 m. The recognition rates are comparable to those of commercial metallic mountable tags...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-A novel inkjet-printed {{electromagnetic}} bandgapbacked (EBG) RFID tag {{has been}} designed and tested for wearable and <b>metal</b> <b>mount</b> applications. An array of split-ring resonators and a dipole antenna matched to an RFID chip at 915 MHz were designed and inkjet printed on paper substrate. Measurements of the tag in free space show that the required reader's minimum transmit power for successful tag reading decreases by 6 dB compared to the case without EBG, while for on-body and on-metal measurements, the read range increases by nearly a factor of 2. It has to {{be noted that the}} proposed RFID tag is flexible since it can be easily fabricated by inkjet printing nanosilver particles on paper or platic substrates. It can find numerous applications ranging from wearable antennas and bio-monitoring to transportation and logiitics for mass shipping...|$|E
