They include the goblin shark, basking shark, <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark,</b> the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
25|$|On July 25, 2017, a <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> was {{recorded}} on video at Gili Lawa Laut near Komodo island, Indonesia, as it swam slowly past divers Penny Bielich and Heikki Innanen. The shark {{appeared to have}} at least one remora attached.|$|E
25|$|The <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> (Megachasma pelagios) is {{a species}} of {{deepwater}} shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is {{the smallest of the}} three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the whale shark and basking shark. Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with 63 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of May 2017, including four recordings on film. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its enormous mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. It is distinctive for its large head with rubbery lips. It is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the distinct family Megachasmidae, though suggestion has been made that it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae, of which the basking shark is currently the sole extant member. In addition to the living M.pelagios, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian M.alisonae and the Oligocene–Miocene M.applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma, and is in fact unrelated to the <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> despite similar teeth morphology.|$|E
2500|$|As {{their name}} implies, megamouths {{have a large}} mouth with small teeth, and a broad, rounded snout, causing {{observers}} to occasionally mistake megamouth for a young orca. The mouth is surrounded by luminous photophores, which may act as a lure for plankton or small fish. This white band is present in both sexes and {{is thought to be}} used as a means of identification to other <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks.</b> Their mouths can reach up to [...] wide. <b>Megamouth</b> <b>sharks</b> have up to 50 rows of teeth in their upper-jaw and up to 75 rows of teeth in their lower-jaw.|$|R
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale <b>sharks,</b> and <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks</b> have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks</b> make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|R
50|$|A planktivore is an aquatic {{organism}} that feeds on planktonic food, including zooplankton or phytoplankton.For example; Titanichthys {{was the first}} massive vertebrate pelagic planktivore, with a lifestyle similar to that ofthe modern basking, whale, or <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks.</b> Although plankton seem small and insignificant they are extremely important to the oceans. Plankton are actually responsible for producing 90% of the worlds oxygen due to the mass amounts of organisms {{in the waters of}} the world.|$|R
25|$|The rate of {{description}} of new catfish {{is at an}} all-time high. Between 2003 and 2005, over 100 species have been named, a rate three times faster than that of the past century. In June 2005, researchers named the newest family of catfish, Lacantuniidae, only the third new family of fish distinguished in the last 70 years (others being the coelacanth in 1938 and the <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> in 1983). The new species in Lacantuniidae, Lacantunia enigmatica, was found in the Lacantun river in the Mexican state of Chiapas.|$|E
25|$|Sharks inhabit all {{the coastal}} waters and estuarine {{habitats}} of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species {{from the family}} Heterodontidae: the Port Jackson shark, the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very {{little is known about}} this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.|$|E
500|$|On 13 March 2004, a {{specimen}} {{of the rare}} and unusual species of shark, <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark,</b> was washed ashore on Gapang beach. <b>Megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> has a distinctive large mouth, very short snout and is broadly rounded in dorsal view.

5000|$|Harris {{spent several}} decades roaming the world, {{working at a}} variety of occupations ranging from farrier to hunting guide to prospector.

5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white <b>sharks,</b> <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks</b> and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|R
500|$|The {{island is}} known for its ecosystem; the Indonesian {{government}} has declared [...] of inland and sea around the island as a wildlife protection area. A rare <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> species was found on shore and the island is the only habitat for the threatened toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). Coral reef areas around the island are known for their large variety of fish species.|$|E
500|$|An older study, {{examining}} whales {{captured by}} the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight. Sperm whales sometimes take sablefish and toothfish from long lines. Long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales {{take advantage of their}} fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt. However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale [...] "bouncing" [...] a long line, to gain the fish. Sperm whales are believed to prey on the <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark,</b> a rare and large deep-sea species discovered in the 1970s. In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} a few alleged {{sightings}} of large sharks, purportedly megalodon, measuring anywhere from [...] throughout the 1900s, however they all lack supporting evidence. More likely they were misidentified whale sharks. One Polynesian myth regards a [...] shark called Lord of the Deep, but this is probably an exaggeration of a whale shark. Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those made by [...] in 1873 which were erroneously dated to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns and greys, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the <b>megamouth</b> <b>shark</b> which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark evolved around warm coastal waters and probably could not survive in the cold and nutrient-poor deep sea environment.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the largest}} extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), {{and the great}} white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Some other species such as <b>megamouth</b> <b>sharks</b> (Megachasma pelagios), Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus), Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are {{comparatively}} poorly studied, {{it is unclear whether}} their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark.
