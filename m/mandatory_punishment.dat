25|$|In Singapore, hanging {{using the}} long-drop method is {{currently}} used as <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for various crimes, such as drug trafficking, murder and {{some types of}} kidnapping. It has also been used for punishing those convicted of unauthorised discharging of firearms.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, {{an attempt}} was made to abolish capital punishment. Ross Thatcher, at that time a Cooperative Commonwealth Federation Member of Parliament, moved Bill No. 2 in order to amend the Criminal Code to abolish the death penalty. Thatcher later withdrew it for fear of Bill No. 2 not {{generating}} positive discussion and further harming the chances of abolition. In 1956, the Joint Committee of the House and Senate recommended the retention of capital punishment as the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for murder, which {{opened the door to the}} possibility of abolition.|$|E
50|$|Capital {{punishment}} in Malaysia {{is a legal}} form of punishment. It is a <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for murder, drug trafficking, treason, and waging war against Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King). Recently, the law has been extended to include acts of terrorism. Any terrorists, and anyone who aids terrorists, financially or otherwise, are liable to face the death penalty. Since January 2003, {{the death penalty in}} Malaysia has been a <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for rapists that cause death and child rapists. A 1961 law states that kidnapping carries a life sentence or a death sentence, preceded by a whipping. Foreigners are not exempt from the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Legal {{professionals}} and academics {{have criticized the}} use of child pornography laws with <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishments</b> against teenagers {{over the age of}} consent for sex offenses. Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that [...] "I do not believe that our child pornography laws were designed for these situations... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up {{to five years in prison}} for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to register as a sex offender." ...|$|R
25|$|Even {{after the}} 2013 reform, marital rape when {{the wife and}} husband live {{together}} continued {{not to be a}} crime in India. Article 376B of the 2013 law made forced sexual intercourse by a man with his wife – if she is living separately – a crime, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, punishable with at least a 2-year prison term. Forced sex by a man on his wife may also be considered a prosecutable domestic violence under other sections of Indian Penal code, such as Section 498(A) as well as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. The crime of sexual assault on a child, that is anyone below the age of eighteen, is further outlined and <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishments</b> described in The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.|$|R
50|$|In Boyce v R, {{which was}} {{released}} on the same day, the JCPC applied the same principles to a similar law in Barbados. Matthew overruled and declared as wrongly decided the November 2003 JCPC decision of Roodal v S, which interpreted the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago as invalidating the law on <b>mandatory</b> capital <b>punishment</b> for murder.|$|R

50|$|Under sharia, {{several dozen}} {{offences}} such as drinking alcohol and {{being close to}} a person {{of the opposite sex}} are subject to caning. The death penalty is the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for persons found guilty of possessing illegal drugs above certain quantities; in 2010, 114 people were sentence to hanging.|$|E
50|$|Under Bruneian {{criminal}} law, offences {{punishable by}} caning include causing hurt, assault, kidnapping, rape, theft, robbery, extortion, and trespassing. It is a <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for certain offences such as rape, kidnapping, and overstaying one's visa. Approximately 100 caning sentences are passed down {{every year in}} Brunei. In 2007, 68 foreign workers were sentenced to caning for immigration offences.|$|E
5000|$|Harsh {{penalties}} lead {{to racial}} disparity. According to the Statistical Overview of Mandatory Minimum Penalties presented in October 2011, [...] "of all offenders convicted of an offense carrying a <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>punishment</b> and who remained subject to that penalty at sentencing, 38.5 percent were Black (n=4,076), 31.8 percent were Hispanic (n=3,364), and 27.5 percent (n=2,913) were White." ...|$|R
50|$|Require {{judges to}} impose <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>punishments</b> on any party who is sanctioned, {{without regard to}} the {{particular}} circumstances of the case. This includes, but is not limited to, attorney fees and costs. The bill also authorizes the court to impose additional sanctions, including striking the pleadings, dismissing the suit, nonmonetary directives, or penalty payments if warranted for effective deterrence.|$|R
5000|$|Apostasy: The Council {{issued a}} fatwa which {{declared}} that apostasy could not, on its own, be {{the grounds for}} any fixed punishment, especially capital punishment. The fatwa states: [...] "The preponderance of evidence from both the Qur’an and Sunnah indicates {{that there is no}} firm ground for the claim that apostasy is in itself a <b>mandatory</b> fixed <b>punishment</b> Hadd, namely capital punishment" ...|$|R
50|$|Burris {{was well}} aware of what he was doing and the {{consequences}} that would apply to him if he were ever caught. In the state of Delaware helping slaves escape was as a very serious offense, and if caught the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> was that one would be sold into slavery for a period of seven years. In June 1847 Burris was caught.|$|E
50|$|On 20 September 1586, Tichborne was {{executed}} with Anthony Babington, John Ballard, {{and four other}} conspirators. They were eviscerated, hanged, drawn and quartered, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for treason, in St Giles Field. However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until 'quite dead' before being eviscerated.|$|E
50|$|Singaporean {{law allows}} caning to be ordered for over 35 offences, {{including}} hostage-taking/kidnapping, robbery, gang robbery with murder, rioting, causing grievous hurt, drug abuse, vandalism, extortion, sexual abuse, and unlawful possession of weapons. Caning {{is also a}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for certain offences such as rape, drug trafficking, illegal moneylending, and for foreigners who overstay by more than 90 days - a measure designed to deter illegal immigrants.|$|E
2500|$|Whether the {{mandatory}} nature of capital punishment, for offences as broadly drawn {{as that of}} trafficking created by section3 of the MDA, was unconstitutional. In addressing this issue, two sub-issues were raised. The first was whether <b>mandatory</b> capital <b>punishment</b> was [...] "in accordance with law" [...] {{as set out in}} Article 9(1). The second was whether {{the mandatory}} nature of capital punishment was unconstitutional because it contravened Article 12(1) of the Singapore Constitution.|$|R
25|$|In 2017, Malvo's {{conviction}} to a {{life sentence}} without parole was overturned on appeal in Virginia, with re-sentencing ordered pursuant to the Supreme Court's ruling {{in the case of}} Miller v. Alabama (2012), which voided <b>mandatory</b> life-sentence <b>punishments</b> for adolescent criminals as legally unconstitutional. Under the re-sentencing, Malvo's minimum sentence to prison will be determined by a judge; the available maximum sentence would be life imprisonment. The ruling does not apply to the six life sentences Malvo received in Maryland.|$|R
50|$|The {{governing}} Saint Lucia Labour Party defended {{their record}} {{in office and}} put the strong economic growth {{over the last few}} years at the centre of their campaign. They also pledged to continue tackling crime in Saint Lucia and to bring in a <b>mandatory</b> capital <b>punishment</b> for anyone convicted of murder. The Saint Lucia Labour Party received assistance in the campaign from the Prime Ministers of St Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica who both spoke in favour of the party at rallies.|$|R
50|$|The other resolutions {{drafted in}} the final {{protocol}} included the introduction of legislation in the participating governments to prohibit the illegitimate possession and use of explosives, membership in anarchist organizations, the distribution of anarchist propaganda, and the rendering of assistance to anarchists. It was also agreed that governments should try to limit press coverage of anarchist activities, and {{that the death penalty}} should be <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for all assassinations of heads of state.|$|E
50|$|Hanafi jurists {{have held}} that the accused must be a muhsan {{at the time of}} religiously {{disallowed}} sex, to be punished by Rajm (stoning). A Muhsan is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists. In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> in such cases).|$|E
5000|$|In 1809, the Maryland {{legislature}} enacted {{laws that}} provided for murder in varying degrees. The <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for first-degree murder was given as death. New laws came into force in 1908 which allowed the sentencing judge discretion, giving {{the option of}} life imprisonment. Then in 1916, the jury was given the option of deciding if they wished to impose the death penalty during their deliberations. They could now return a sentence of guilty [...] "without capital punishment." ...|$|E
5000|$|Require {{judges to}} impose {{mandatory}} sanctions on any attorney, law firm, or party that has violated, or {{is responsible for}} the violation of, the rule with regard to representations to the court. The bill would substitute the word [...] "may" [...] with the word [...] "shall," [...] forcing judges to levy <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>punishments.</b> Current law allows judges to evaluate the specific situation and order appropriate remedies. As a result of the legislation, judges will no longer have the discretion in imposing these penalties.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to a fine or jail term, the Act imposes <b>mandatory</b> corporal <b>punishment</b> of between three and eight strokes of the cane for second or subsequent convictions. Caning is also imposed for first convictions for defacing property using an indelible substance; and stealing, destroying or damaging public property. The Children and Young Persons Act ("CYPA") states that the High Court may impose a caning penalty on juvenile offenders as well. In a 1968 case, the High Court held that despite the wording of this provision, a subordinate court may sentence juveniles to caning under the Vandalism Act as that Act takes precedence over the CYPA.|$|R
40|$|The politicisation of {{sentencing}} {{law reform}} reached new heights in the Northern Territory CNT), in November 1996, when the NT Parliament passed legislation providing for mandatory imprisonment for first-time property offenders {{and creating a}} novel sentencing option called a 2 ̆ 7 punitive work order 2 ̆ 7. The legislation is the Sentencing Amendment Act (No. 2) 1996 CNT) and Juvenile Justice Amendment Act (No. 2) 1996 CNT) (together {{referred to as the}} Amendments).

50|$|The Directorate has {{departments}} of Forest Development; Forest Eradication; Local Population Assistance; Engineering Penetration; Scientific Security; etc. The Directorate personnel drink kefir with enormous appetite, calculate with broken adding machines, issue strange orders, {{and listen to}} the Director's speeches on their personal telephones, each supposedly hearing their own special version. When a top secret robot escapes they hunt it down with their eyes taped shut, to avoid a <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for seeing the secret machine. Most of the staff only ever visit the Forest for a short trip to the bio-station where the salary payments are made. And {{this is the only way}} Peretz can see the Forest.|$|E
50|$|After the Furman v. Georgia {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that death penalty statutes were unconstitutionally arbitrary in their application, the Maryland legislature removed all arbitrariness by making death the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for first-degree murder once again. Such laws were found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional in Woodson v. North Carolina. As such, the Maryland legislature took the route which the Supreme Court had found acceptable in Gregg v. Georgia and introduced bifurcated trials, where the jury first decided guilt and then punishment, mandatory appellate review, and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Further laws changes in 1987 and 1989 excluded juveniles and the mentally retarded from execution.|$|E
50|$|In September 2003, {{the adult}} Muhammad {{was sentenced to}} death, and, in October, the {{adolescent}} Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life-sentences without parole. On November 10, 2009, Muhammad was put to death by lethal injection, at the Greensville Correctional Center near Jarratt, Virginia. In 2017, Malvo's conviction to a life-sentence without parole was overturned on appeal, with re-sentencing ordered pursuant to the Supreme Court's ruling {{in the case of}} Miller v. Alabama (2012), which voided <b>mandatory</b> life-sentence <b>punishments</b> for adolescent criminals as legally un-Constitutional.

5000|$|A {{city council}} {{decision}} {{might be to}} change {{the goal of the}} lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more tourist oriented facility or a conservation area.

5000|$|By early 2007 Ferguson was out {{on parole}} and the Supreme Court had {{reversed}} its decision to hear Ferguson's appeal. In 2008, the appeal struck down his sentence. According to his lawyer, Noel O'Brien, the decision {{was based on the}} conclusion that [...] "where a mandatory minimum sentence amounts to 'cruel and unusual punishment' and thus a violation under s. 12 of the Charter Of Rights, the only option open to a trial judge is to strike down the legislation itself, even if the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> would be constitutional {{in the vast majority of}} cases. The ruling means that if a law creating a mandatory minimum sentence is unconstitutional for [...] "any" [...] individual, it will be unconstitutional for [...] "all" [...] individuals." ...|$|E
5000|$|Judicial caning {{is meant}} {{to serve as a}} humiliating {{experience}} for offenders and as a strong deterrent to crime. In 1966, when Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew introduced caning as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> for vandalism, he said in Parliament, [...] "... if (the offender) knows he is going to get three of the best, I think he will lose a great deal of enthusiasm, because there is little glory attached to the rather humiliating experience of having to be caned." [...] The severity and humiliation of the punishment are widely publicised in various ways, mainly through the press but also through other means such as education. For example, juvenile delinquents get to watch a real-life demonstration of caning on a dummy during compulsory prison visits.|$|E
50|$|In Botswana, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>punishment</b> {{for murder}} {{is the death}} penalty. After Mariette Bosch had spent one year on death row, she was hanged at 5:30 (AM), on the early morning of Saturday 31 March 2001. The {{execution}} {{took place at the}} Central Maximum Prison in Gaborone. Bosch's family and lawyers were not given advance notice of her death. The day after the hanging occurred, Mariette Bosch's family drove to visit her when they learned about the hanging over the radio. Tienie Wolmarans said he had attempted a scheduled visit the previous day, on a Friday, to give Mariette Bosch some things, but was told that there was an inspection, and so they were unable to conduct the visit. Mariette Bosch's death warrant was given that day. Tienie Wolmarans said that the prison authorities had lied to him.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Justice O'Connor disputed {{that the}} Court's modern cases {{dictated}} the result. [...] Although the Court in Mullaney v. Wilbur, , may have {{ruled that the}} jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements applied to the facts that dictated the degree of homicide crime the defendant had committed, and thus the level of punishment {{to which he was}} subject, two years later, in Patterson v. New York, , the Court ruled that a state could place on defendants the burden of proving affirmative defenses, such as extreme emotional disturbance. [...] Patterson, for Justice O'Connor, repudiated the general principle that facts bearing on the degree of punishment must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. [...] Also, McMillan v. Pennsylvania, , was not relevant to the Court's rule because McMillan involved a <b>mandatory</b> minimum <b>punishment,</b> rather than a maximum sentence.|$|R
40|$|Drug {{trafficking}} in Malaysia is punishable with a <b>mandatory</b> capital <b>punishment.</b> To convict {{a person for}} drug trafficking is a laborious task for the prosecution. This paper presents {{the findings of the}} research on drug trafficking cases which revealed that the courts have been vigorous in meting out capital punishment. However, there are challenges faced by the prosecution in succeeding in cases. This study found various hindrances that frustrate the efforts in combating drug trafficking activities. In some cases, due to evidential procedures and requirements, the person accused for drug trafficking had to be acquitted even though the amount of drugs involved in the case appeared to suggest that there was some drug-related activities. Therefore, while capital punishment is theoretically aimed at deterring drug trafficking, much has to be done to achieve the intended objective...|$|R
2500|$|Narcotics laws {{established}} by the Misuse of Drugs Act are very strict. Anyone caught with more than [...] of heroin (diamorphine), [...] of cocaine or morphine, [...] of methamphetamine, or [...] of cannabis faces <b>mandatory</b> capital <b>punishment,</b> as they are deemed to be trafficking in these substances. The stated quantities are the net weight of the substances {{after they have been}} isolated by laboratory analysis. Between 1991 and 2004, 400 people were hanged in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, one of the highest per-capita execution rates in the world. Persons caught with amounts of controlled substances less than the quantities that would warrant the mandatory death sentence may be spared from the gallows. They may, however, still face harsh penalties ranging from long terms of imprisonment to a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane (for males).|$|R
