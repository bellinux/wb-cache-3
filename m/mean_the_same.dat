5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
25|$|The {{expressions}} A ⊂ B and B ⊃ A {{are used}} differently by different authors; some authors {{use them to}} <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as A ⊆ B (respectively B ⊇ A), whereas others use them to <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as A ⊊ B (respectively B ⊋ A).|$|E

25|$|If {{military}} careers {{were now}} possible, so were careers for military specialists, such as medici. Under Augustus {{for the first}} time occupational names of officers and functions began to appear in inscriptions. The valetudinaria, or military versions of the aesculapia (the names <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing) became features of permanent camps. Caches of surgical instruments have been found in some of them. From this indirect evidence it is possible to conclude to the formation of an otherwise unknown permanent medical corps.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem in}} {{describing}} vocal sound {{lies in the}} vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This {{has led to the}} use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.|$|E

25|$|De Valera’s {{preoccupation with}} {{his part in}} history, and his need to explain and justify it, are {{reflected}} in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify {{what he saw as}} the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.|$|E
25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the unary operation 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E

500|$|The vocals for [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] were {{recorded}} at CBS Columbia Square, starting on August 24 and continuing sporadically {{until the very}} last day of assembly on September 21.
