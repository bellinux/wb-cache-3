50|$|In 1938, the {{brothers}} invented Zyglo and <b>Magnaglo,</b> two flaw-detection processes that used fluorescent dyes. The dyes penetrate defects in machined parts, allowing the defects to be detected by inspecting the parts under black light. (<b>Magnaglo</b> {{was based on}} a preceding process of magnetic particle inspection that detects flaws in ferromagnetic materials. Because <b>Magnaglo</b> uses fluorescence instead of magnetism, the process can be used on non-ferromagnetic materials.) After a dispute with Continental Lithograph over the rights to Zyglo and <b>Magnaglo,</b> {{the brothers}} established the independent Switzer Brothers, Inc., in 1946 to continue developing and marketing new uses for fluorescent materials. The company changed its name to Day-Glo Color Corp. in 1969.|$|E

5000|$|Robert C. Switzer, usually {{known as}} Bob Switzer, (19 May 1914 [...] - [...] 20 August 1997) was an American inventor, {{businessman}} and environmentalist. Bob was co-inventor {{of the first}} black light fluorescent paint along with his brother Joseph Switzer and {{the inventor of the}} <b>Magnaglo</b> process for nondestructive flaw-detection in machined parts. The brothers founded the Day-Glo Color Corp. in 1946 to develop and manufacture fluorescent paints, pigments and other products.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, DayGlo {{products}} were extensively {{used by the}} U.S. military in applications where visibility was required. U.S. ground troops in North Africa identified themselves using daylight fluorescent fabric panels to prevent friendly fire bombings by pilots, and DayGlo paints were used on aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. Navy air carriers used DayGlo's black light fluorescent paints to allow planes to land at night, an advantage that enemy pilots did not have. Military equipment manufacturers, particularly those of aircraft parts, employed DayGlo's Zyglo and <b>Magnaglo</b> processes to identify defects in metal fabricated parts.After the war, daylight fluorescent paints were used by advertisers to make their products more visible to consumers. Tide detergent became known for its fluorescent packaging beginning in 1959, but other products such as clothing, posters and hula hoops also used daylight fluorescent colors. Daylight fluorescent pigments were also used across safety applications such as construction cones, street signs and safety vests, due to their high visibility.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to familiarize the student with magnetic particle inspection and relate it to classification of various defects. Magnetic particle inspection is a method of detecting the presence of cracks, laps, tears, inclusions, and similar discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials such as iron and steel. This method will most clearly show defects that are perpendicular to the magnetic field. The <b>Magnaglo</b> method uses a liquid which is sprayed on the workpiece to be inspected, and the part is magnetized at the same time. The workpiece is then viewed under a black light, {{and the presence of}} discontinuity is shown by the formation of a bright indication formed by the magnetic particles over the discontinuity. The equipment and experimental procedures are described...|$|E
