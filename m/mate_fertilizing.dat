25|$|Mate {{choice is}} seen in {{cuttlefish}} species, where females prefer some males over others, though characteristics of the preferred males are unknown. A hypothesis states that females reject males by olfactory cues rather than visual cues. Several cephalopod species are polyandrous- accepting and storing multiple male spermatophores, which has been identified by DNA fingerprinting. Females are no longer receptive to mating attempts when holding their eggs in their arm. Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored. Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which <b>mate</b> <b>fertilizes</b> the eggs. In order to reduce this sort of competition, males develop agonistic behaviors like mate guarding and flushing. Flushing is used by both the male and female; it {{is the process of}} removing spermatophores of other males by continuously pumping strong jets of water into the buccal cavity of the female. This behavior however, reduces the available time to mate with other females.|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{competition}} is {{the competition for}} fertilizations between ejaculates, within a female, following multiple mating. There are four sperm utilization or precedence patterns: first male precedence, where the first male to <b>mate</b> <b>fertilizes</b> most of the eggs laid by a female; last male precedence, where the last male to <b>mate</b> <b>fertilizes</b> most of the eggs laid by a female; "all-or-none" pattern, where sperm from either male fertilizes all the eggs laid by a female but which male's sperm that is used is random; or sperm mixing, where sperm from each male is used equally in fertilizing eggs laid by a female. Intermediate utilization patterns are also possible. Sperm competition occurs {{in a wide variety}} of insect species as well as other animals. This study was undertaken to study sperm competition in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. Four experiments were conducted: a radiation and sterilization experiment, a diapause experiment, and 2 competition experiments. It was found that 7, 000 rad of gamma radiation sterilized adult ~ integer males. There was no diapause in the laboratory in ~ integer eggs. In the first competition experiment, three groups of females were used: females mated with a normal male, then with a second normal male (NN group); females mated with a normal male, and then with a sterile male (NR group); and females mated with a sterile male, and then with a normal male (RN group). The results obtained from this experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched was significantly different between 3 groups of females, with the proportion hatched much greater in the NN group than in either the NR or RN groups. The pattern for the proportion of eggs hatched following a double mating most closely resembled a pattern expected if sperm mixing is occurring. Results obtained in the replicate competition experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched for the females in the NR group was significantly lower than the proportion hatched in the other two groups. This also supports a model of sperm mixing as a precedence pattern. Values calculated following Boorman and Parker (1976), for the proportion of eggs fertilized by the second male to mate following a double mating, were 0. 57 in competition experiment 1 and 0. 62 in the replicate.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for CFC; however, we only have experimental evidence for a few of them. Female control of oviposition timing is a potentially widespread mechanism of CFC, but {{it has never been}} experimentally demonstrated. The aims of this study are to test 2 critical predictions of the hypothesis that CFC through control of oviposition timing occurs in the soldier fly Merosargus cingulatus: 1) to determine if M. cingulatus females are less likely to oviposit immediately after mating when the male does not perform copulatory courtship than when he does and 2) to determine if failure to immediately oviposit by the female results in lower reproductive success for the male she just mated with. To answer the first question, I compared the oviposition behavior of females that mated with control males versus females that mated with manipulated males that could not perform copulatory courtship. I showed that M. cingulatus females fail to oviposit immediately after copulation when males do not perform copulatory courtship. To answer the second question, I showed that there is last male sperm precedence in M. cingulatus. Because the last male to <b>mate</b> <b>fertilizes</b> most of the female's eggs, a male will benefit when females oviposit immediately after mating with him and before remating with another male.

40|$|Background: In {{populations of}} most social insects, gene flow is {{maintained}} through mating between reproductive individuals from different colonies in periodic nuptial flights followed by dispersal of the fertilized foundresses. Some ant species, however, form large polygynous supercolonies, in which mating takes {{place within the}} maternal nest (intranidal <b>mating)</b> and <b>fertilized</b> queens disperse within or along the boundary of the supercolony, leading to supercolony growth (colony budding). As a consequence, gene flow is largely confined within supercolonies. Over time, such supercolonies may diverge genetically and, thus, also in recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHC’s) {{by a combination of}} genetic drift and accumulation of colony-specific, neutral mutations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested this hypothesis for six supercolonies of the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes in north-east Borneo. Within supercolonies, workers from different nests tolerated each other, were closely related and showed highly similar CHC profiles. Between supercolonies, aggression ranged from tolerance to mortal encounters and was negatively correlated with relatedness and CHC profile similarity.

The absence of tools for the unambiguous discrimination between competing sperm from different {{males in the}} complex female reproductive tract has strongly limited the understanding of mechanisms controlling sperm dynamics and use. Results: Here we use transgenic medfly lines expressing green or red fluorescent proteins in the spermatozoa, which can be easily observed and unambiguously differentiated within the female fertilization chamber. In twice-mated females, {{one day after the}} second mating, sperm from the first male appeared to be homogenously distributed all over the distal portion of each alveolus within the fertilization chamber, whereas sperm from the second male were clearly concentrated in the central portion of each alveolus.

50|$|P. sulcifer is a {{permanent}} workerless species, and consists only of reproductive males and females. Because P. sulcifer is an obligate social parasite, its cycle depends heavily on that of its host species P. dominula, {{also known as the}} yellow paper wasp. As mentioned previously, P. sulcifer queens (mated females) overwinter at high altitudes. Come May, they emerge. They tend to overwinter {{for a longer period of}} time than their host P. dominula, which emerges in April. This ensures that the parasites reach the host nest at the optimal time: just before worker emergence, when only the host foundresses are in the nest, leading to an easier invasion. Once a queen P. sulcifer has successfully invaded a nest, the host nest is built up by the host workers after their emergence in early summer.

40|$|Female {{animals that}} use sperm {{from a single}} <b>mating</b> to <b>fertilize</b> eggs over an {{extended}} period require efficient mechanisms for sperm storage and use. There have been few studies of these mechanisms in tephritid flies. Mating, copula duration, sperm storage and sperm usage patterns are assessed in an Australian tephritid, the Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni; a. k. a. 'Q-fly'). In particular, the present study investigates whether each of these aspects of mating varies in relation to female size or male size, whether sperm storage patterns change over time after mating (1, 5, 10 and 15 days), and the relative roles of the ventral receptacle and the two spermathecae as sperm storage organs. Large females are more likely to mate than are small females, and are also more fecund in the first 5 days after mating. Females are more likely to store some sperm and, among those that store some sperm, store more sperm if their mate is large. Most sperm are stored in the spermathecae (median = 97 %), often with high levels of asymmetry between the two spermathecae. Asymmetry of sperm storage is related to number of sperm stored, but not to male or female size. Total number of stored sperm declines over the 15 days after mating, but this decrease in sperm numbers only reflects changes in the spermathecae; numbers of sperm in the ventral receptacle remain unchanged over this period. As a consequence, the proportion of total sperm stored in the spermathecae declines relative to the ventral receptacle. These results are consistent with a system in which small numbers of sperm are maintained in the ventral receptacle for fertilizations, and are replenished by sperm from the spermathecae as required. Sperm distribution and usage patterns in Q-flies are comparable with recent findings in medflies, Ceratitis capitata, but differ markedly from patterns found in several Anastrepha species. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of sexual life cycles, fusion between single-celled gametes is directly followed by nuclear fusion, leading to a diploid zygote and a lifelong commitment between two haploid genomes. Mushroom-forming basidiomycetes differ in two key respects. First, the multicellular haploid <b>mating</b> partners are <b>fertilized</b> in their entirety, each cell being a gamete that simultaneously can behave as a female, i. e. contributing the cytoplasm to a zygote by accepting nuclei, and a male gamete, i. e. only donating nuclei to the zygote. Second, after gamete union, the two haploid genomes remain separate so that the main vegetative stage, the dikaryon, has two haploid nuclei per cell. Only when the dikaryon produces mushrooms, do the nuclei fuse to enter a short diploid stage, immediately followed by meiosis and haploid spore formation. So in basidiomycetes, gamete fusion and genome mixing (sex) are separated in time. The ‘living apart together’ of nuclei in the dikaryon maintains some autonomy for nuclei to engage in a relationship with a different nucleus. We show that competition among the two nuclei of the dikaryon for such ‘extramarital affairs’ may lead to genomic conflict by favouring genes beneficial {{at the level of the}} nucleus, but deleterious at that of the dikaryon. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{cultivation of}} dwarf coconut {{is rare in}} the world, representing about 5 % of global population. However, Dwarfs are currently receiving more attention, particularly for the harvest of tender nut water. Dwarfs are distinguished from tall coconuts primarily by their short height with an absence of a bole {{at the base of}} the stem, their early setting of nuts, their predominantly self <b>fertilizing</b> <b>mating</b> system and by large numbers of relatively small nuts. To date, the origin and domestication of Dwarfs has not been established. This study investigates the origin and domestication of dwarf coconut using molecular markers, mainly microsatellite (SSR) data. The inheritance of height and the presence of a bole was investigated in the F 2 of a cross between Dwarf and Tall palms. The data suggest that the presence of a bole results from a single codominant locus. There was no strong association between the presence of a bole and height, with height also depending on a single codominant gene. However genetic and environmental factors make it difficult to assign individuals a definite genotype. SSR allele frequency differences between dwarf and tall accessions, ethno botanical and geographic information indicate that dwarf coconut originated from a typical domestication event in Southeast Asia.

50|$|Unlike other ants, {{they are}} seen singly or in small groups and their colonies consist of very small numbers of individuals. They are also unusual amongst ants in that the queen-worker {{difference}} is very limited and some workers can <b>mate</b> and lay <b>fertilized</b> eggs just like the queen. These workers are termed gamergates. New colonies are founded independently by single queens, and on aging they are replaced by several gamergates. The gamergates copulate with males from their own colonies and, being inbred, {{are related to the}} original founding queen. Colonies are very small, and they never undergo fission to form new colonies. The workers limit the number of reproductives in the colony by policing new workers that try to lay eggs when an active queen or established gamergates are present. Workers use alarm pheromones which include 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol and isopentyl isopentanoate. H. saltator, like many species of ant, produces 4-methyl-3-heptanone from mandibular glands. Dufour's gland secretions have been found to include a complex mixture of linear hydrocarbons from C15 to C25, with (Z)-9-tricosene being the main constituent, along with other minor constituents like tetradecyl propionate and traces of tetradecyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. Both the secretions from the postpharyngeal glands and the cuticular wax include methyl esters of common fatty acids.|$|R
