5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E

25|$|Secondary dormancy* {{is caused}} by {{conditions}} after the seed has been dispersed and occurs in some seeds when nondormant seed is exposed to conditions that are not favorable to germination, very often high temperatures.

25|$|In September 2009 the Euston Arch Trust {{revealed}} detailed {{plans to}} rebuild the Arch in front of Euston Station, between a pair of existing lodges on Euston Road (see right). It was reported that lettable space in the Arch could help pay the cost of construction, now estimated at £10 million. The Trust suggests this <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> a 'banqueting room' {{at the top of}} the Arch and a 'nightclub' in the basement.|$|E

25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) aims {{to reduce}} attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that {{may increase the}} likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use cognitive restructuring to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is relapse prevention, where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions.|$|E

25|$|Mass flows, such as kg/s, are {{the easiest}} to use in {{practice}} as there is little room for confusion. Questions remaining would involve inlet or outlet (which <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> leakage from the compressor or moisture condensation). For atmospheric air, the mass flow may be wet or dry (including or excluding humidity). Often, the mass flow specification will be presented on an equivalent Mach number basis. It is standard in these cases that the equivalent temperature, equivalent pressure and gas is specified explicitly or implied at a standard condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be the reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
25|$|Guerrillas in wars {{against foreign}} powers may direct their attacks at civilians, {{particularly}} if foreign forces are too strong {{to be confronted}} directly on a long term basis. In Vietnam, bombings and terror attacks against civilians were fairly common, and were often effective in demoralizing local opinion that supported the ruling regime and its American backers. While attacking an American base <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> lengthy planning and casualties, smaller scale terror strikes in the civilian sphere were easier to execute. Such attacks also {{had an effect on}} the international scale, demoralizing American opinion, and hastening a withdrawal.|$|E

Information gleaned from informers and sympathizers was joined {{to data from}} direct reconnaissance via patrols, infiltration or probing attacks. The analysis was comprehensive, and <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> size and composition of enemy forces, avenues of approach and withdrawal, civilian morale, hit lists of suspected traitors or troublesome dissenters who {{did not support the}} Revolution, available civilian labor to support logistics, detailed location of individual walls, ditches or fences {{and a host of other}} factors, both political and military.|$|E
25|$|Sample {{processing}} and manipulation {{in order to}} selectively present that target in a discernible or measurable form to a discrimination/identification/detection system. It <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> a simple centrifugal separation or washing or filtration or capture by some form of selective binding or it may even involve modifying the target e.g. epitope retrieval in immunological assays or cutting down the target into pieces e.g. in Mass Spectrometry. Generally there are multiple separate steps done before an assay and are called preanalytic processing. But some of the manipulations may be inseparable part of the assay itself and will not thus be considered pre-analytic.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} republic in 1919, rather than {{any other form of}} government, was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with Great Britain, and set the party against any compromise that <b>might</b> <b>involve</b> initial self-government under the Home Rule Act 1914 or continued membership of the British Empire. One obstacle to this decision—that the Unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved, the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and later the Anglo-Irish Treaty.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{evidence}} suggests that an inhibition of the proteasome, as demonstrated in Parkinson’s disease, <b>might</b> be <b>involved</b> in Alzheimer’s disease. In this disease and other Tauopathies, Tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated and aggregated within degenerating neurons. In this state, Tau is also ubiquitinated, suggesting that the proteasome <b>might</b> be <b>involved</b> in Tau proteolysis. Thus, to investigate if proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau, we used neuroblastoma cells overexpressing Tau proteins. Surprisingly, we showed that the inhibition of the proteasome led to a bidirectional degradation of Tau. Following this result, the cellular mechanisms that may degrade Tau were investigated...|$|R
