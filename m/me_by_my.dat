500|$|Planché's {{research}} to determine historically accurate costume for the 1823 production of King John {{led to his}} developing {{a strong interest in}} the subject. [...] When he published his first major work in 1834, History of British Costume from the Earliest Period to the Close of the 18th Century, Planché described it as [...] "the result of ten years' diligent devotion to its study of every leisure hour left <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>my</b> professional engagements". Prior to this Planché had published his costume designs for King John and the other Shakespeare plays, with [...] "biographical, critical and explanatory notices". After travelling twice to the Continent, he wrote about his journeys in Lays and Legends of the Rhine (1826) and Descent of the Danube (1827).|$|E

[...] However, Bo Diddley uses imagery more common to the American Southwest, combined with exaggerated bravado. [...] He explained that the first line, [...] "I got forty-seven miles of barbed wire", came to him quickly, [...] "but I couldn't get a rhyme for it. [...] I thought of car tires and mule trains, and I couldn't get anything to fit. [...] Then one day I said 'use a cobra snake,' and my drummer, Clifton James, added 'for a necktie'". [...] These are directed at a female he is trying to woo – [...] "who do you love, me or him".

2500|$|Lavelle agreed {{but said}} that [...] "the impetus for what went into that report stems from <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>my</b> stating {{that we could not}} report ‘no reaction.’ Now there is a {{difference}} here between that and a false report." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007 Paddick commented: [...] "I {{always felt}} like a {{fish out of water}} in the police, not just on gay issues but generally. I was a very counter-cultural senior officer. I'm very non-hierarchical and got into trouble for insisting on people calling <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>my</b> first name.

2500|$|The poem was {{inspired}} by Wordsworth being surrounded by snow, and his sister's memory of a real incident that happened at Halifax.

It was founded on a circumstance told <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>my</b> Sister, {{of a little girl}} who, not far from Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm.

2500|$|Draper's {{tenure in}} Virginia was so {{successful}} that in 1922, when Dr. Hugh Cumming became the Surgeon General, Draper was brought onto his staff and {{put in charge of}} the States Relations Division where he would work with the health departments of each state. [...] With only twelve years in the Public Health Service, Dr. Draper was promoted to Assistant Surgeon General, possibly becoming the youngest member of the Public Health Service to reach this position up to that time. [...] Draper became very involved in working with state health departments, and deeply interested in helping states get appropriations from congress to develop county health departments through which better control of disease could be carried on. [...] In a 1963 interview he said [...] "I don't think there was a state health officer that I didn't call by his first name and who didn't call <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>my</b> first name too." [...] In September 1926, Draper was assigned as assistant surgeon general in charge of domestic quarantine, continuing to maintain his close ties and collaboration with the various state health departments. [...] In 1949, after Draper's retirement from the Public Health Service, he was given an award of recognition from the Conference of State and Provincial Health Associations of North America for his long and meritorious public health service.|$|E
