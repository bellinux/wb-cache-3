5|$|For Nigel Strudwick, {{the reforms}} of Djedkare Isesi were {{undertaken}} {{as a reaction}} to the rapid growth of the central administration {{in the first part of}} the Fifth Dynasty which, Baer adds, had amassed too <b>much</b> <b>political</b> or economic power in the eyes of the king.|$|E

5|$|During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms {{period of}} China (907–960), while the {{fractured}} political realm of China saw no threat in a Tibet {{which was in}} just as <b>much</b> <b>political</b> disarray, there was {{little in the way}} of Sino-Tibetan relations. Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty (907–1125) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty (1115–1234).|$|E
5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After <b>much</b> <b>political</b> dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{campaigned on}} the {{platform}} that Eisenhower was weak on defense {{and that he was}} not doing enough to solve the looming missile gap. After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as <b>much</b> <b>political</b> and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E

Fraternal, ethnic, and civic organizations extended cooperatives and supported local ventures from insurance companies to orphanages and hospitals.

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to <b>much</b> <b>political</b> wrangling with regard {{to the size of the}} Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they provided some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so <b>much</b> <b>political</b> power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Despite the ruthlessness and {{determination}} of the supporters of the coup, the rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing point for Franco’s African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and León fell quickly, and in Pamplona they celebrated the uprising {{as if it were}} a festival. The government retained control of Málaga, Jaén and Almería. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the Montaña barracks. The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago Casares Quiroga was replaced by José Giral who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and other main cities in the Mediterranean area, but it allowed the anarchists to arm themselves and take control of Barcelona and large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. In Barcelona, the official government lost control of security, essential services and welfare. However, the anarchists held back from demanding too <b>much</b> <b>political</b> power, which could have had even more serious consequences. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death, despite broadcasting a message explaining his captivity over the radio at the request of the authorities.|$|E

25|$|While the {{population}}s of the eastern and Asian stocks appear stable, {{the population of the}} western stock, particularly along the Aleutian Islands, was estimated to have fallen by 70–80% since the 1970s. As a consequence, in 1997, the western stock of Steller sea lions was listed as endangered and the eastern stock was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They have since been the object of intense study and the focus of <b>much</b> <b>political</b> and scientific debate in Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Early in his career, Gilbert wrote {{a number}} of {{successful}} blank-verse fairy comedies. He was clearly fascinated by this plot, which had {{been the subject of}} his 1871 short story of the same name before writing The Wicked World in 1873. He also wrote (under a pseudonym) an 1873 play that parodies The Wicked World called The Happy Land, and contained <b>much</b> <b>political</b> satire aimed at politicians of the day; this made a sensation at the Court Theatre after the Lord Chamberlain banned parts of it.|$|E
25|$|After <b>much</b> <b>political</b> {{debate and}} several legal challenges, the Commission's {{proposals}} {{resulted in the}} abolition of Berkshire county council and the counties of Avon, Cleveland, HerefordandWorcester and Humberside (created in 1974). Combined with a second wave of reviews in 1995, under the chairmanship of David Cooksey, the Commission's proposals {{led to the creation}} of unitary authorities covering many urban areas of England, including cities like Bristol, Hull, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, Stoke-on-Trent and Plymouth. Reforms in the rest of Great Britain followed a different course.|$|E

The outgoing Prime Minister James Callaghan made his government's papers on Trident available to Margaret Thatcher's new incoming Conservative Party government, which took the decision to acquire the Trident C4 missile.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{containerisation}} revolutionised shipping, eventually {{coming to}} New Zealand as well. The local harbour boards wrought massive changes on those ports selected (after <b>much</b> <b>political</b> wrangling) {{to handle the}} new giant vessels, such as Lyttelton and Auckland Port. Gantry cranes, straddle carriers and powerful tugboats were built or purchased, and shipping channels dredged deeper, while large areas of land were reclaimed to enable the new container terminals. The changes {{have been described as}} having been more radical than the changeover from sail to steam a century before.|$|E
25|$|The years 1815–1835 saw <b>much</b> <b>political</b> {{and social}} turmoil in Britain, not {{least in the}} medical profession. There were radical medical {{students}} and campaigners in both Edinburgh and London, the two main training centres for the profession at the time. Many of these were materialists who held views favouring evolution, but of a Lamarckian or Geoffroyan kind. It is the allegiance to hard inheritance or to natural selection which distinguishes Lawrence, Prichard and Wells, because those ideas have survived, and {{are part of the}} present-day account of evolution.|$|E
