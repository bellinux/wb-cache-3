5000|$|Hay {{graduated}} from the New York University Medical College in 1891 and was licensed in Pennsylvania. Following graduation he practiced in Youngsville, and was the surgeon for the American Tinplate Company of New Castle. While he was in Pennsylvania he set-up the <b>Hay</b> Rest <b>Cure</b> which was advertised as [...] "a special service department <b>for</b> the <b>cure</b> of <b>hay</b> fever cases". [...] In 1905, it seems he had an episode of acute heart failure following running for a train. As a result, he discovered that he had Bright's disease (or hypertension) with a dilated heart, a condition with a poor prognosis at the time. As a consequence he changed his diet, discontinued coffee and stopped smoking. His condition improved, he lost weight and his blood pressure fell. Over the next 4 years he developed a dietary system based on this experience. The dietary system he developed involved fasting and promoted the idea that certain foods require an acid pH environment in digestion, and other foods require an alkaline pH environment, and that both cannot {{take place at the}} same time, in the same environment.|$|R

It is {{equipped}} with both an adjustable front bipod and a rear <b>monopod</b> <b>for</b> maximum accuracy. The barrel is fitted with a high-efficiency muzzle brake which reduces the felt recoil to about the level expected of a 7.62×51mm NATO-chambered rifle. The stock is also adjustable.|$|R
50|$|On some farms {{the loose}} hay was {{stored in a}} barrack, shed, or barn, {{normally}} {{in such a way}} that it would compress down and <b>cure.</b> <b>Hay</b> could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.|$|R

50|$|In {{place of}} or to {{supplement}} a tripod, some photographers use a one-legged telescoping stand called a <b>monopod</b> <b>for</b> convenience in setup and breakdown. A monopod requires the photographer {{to hold the}} camera in place, but because the monopod reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the camera, and also because the photographer no longer has to support {{the full weight of}} the camera, it can provide some of the same stabilization advantages as a tripod.|$|R
50|$|A {{cause of}} nasal {{congestion}} {{may also be}} due to an allergic reaction caused by hay fever, so avoiding allergens is a common remedy if this becomes a confirmed diagnosis. Antihistamines and decongestants can provide significant symptom relief although they do not <b>cure</b> <b>hay</b> fever. Antihistamines may be given continuously during pollen season for optimum control of symptoms. Topical decongestants should only be used by patients for a maximum of 3 days in a row, because rebound congestion may occur {{in the form of}} rhinitis medicamentosa.|$|R
40|$|The {{drying rate}} and {{chemical}} composition of lucerne hay that was field dried (sun cured) or artificially dried in a forced air bulk drier (FABD) were compared during summer (which is {{the dry season}} in the Western Cape Province). On six hay cutting occasions, plant material {{was left in the}} field for 24 hours after which some material was transferred to a FABD while the rest was left in the field <b>for</b> sun <b>curing.</b> The drying rate of lucerne hay in the FABD was significantly higher than in the field. The chemical composition of sun <b>cured</b> and lucerne <b>hay</b> dried in the FABD did not differ significantly. The study showed that, under good hay making conditions, sun <b>cured</b> lucerne <b>hay</b> is just as good as artificially dried lucerne hay, although the drying rate in the FABD was higher than field drying. _______________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
50|$|Methods and the {{terminology}} {{to describe the}} steps of making hay have varied greatly throughout history, and many regional variations still exist today. However, whether done by hand or by modern mechanized equipment, tall grass and legumes at the proper stage of maturity must be cut, then allowed to dry (preferably by the sun), then raked into long, narrow piles known as windrows. Next, the <b>cured</b> <b>hay</b> is gathered up in some form (usually by some type of baling process) and placed for storage into a haystack or into a barn or shed {{to protect it from}} moisture and rot.|$|R

50|$|A selfie stick is a monopod {{used to take}} selfie {{photographs}} by positioning a smartphone or camera beyond the normal range of the arm. The metal sticks are typically extensible, with a handle on one end and an adjustable clamp {{on the other end}} to hold a phone in place. Some have remote or Bluetooth controls, letting the user decide when to take the picture, and models designed for cameras have a mirror behind the viewscreen so that the shot can be lined up. In contrast to a <b>monopod</b> <b>for</b> stabilising a camera on the ground, a selfie stick's arm is thickest and strongest at the opposite end from the camera in order to provide better grip and balance when held aloft. Safety concerns and the inconvenience the product causes to others have resulted in them being banned at many venues, including all Disney Parks, both Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood.|$|R

The rifle has a Picatinny rail for mounting optics. The rifle also features an improved muzzle brake over the SSG 04, with the ability to attach a suppressor. Introduced in 2008, Steyr claims EKO Cobra, Austrias primary counter-terrorism unit, had its hand in developing this weapon. The SSG 08 utilises the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action, cold hammer-forged barrels, trigger units and magazines of its parent, the SSG 04, but features an aluminium alloy stock, with side-folding, fully adjustable butt and additional Picatinny rails on the forend. The SSG 08 is advertised as capable of sub-MOA accuracy with proper ammunition.|$|R

40|$|Many factors affect forage quality, {{including}} {{moisture level}} at baling, compaction, bulk density, and maturity at harvest. Losses of dry matter and nutrient value occur during field <b>curing.</b> <b>Hay</b> baled {{at or above}} 18 % moisture should have less nutrient loss in the field. However, hay baled at these moisture levels {{has the potential to}} heat during storage, causing dry matter loss and nutrient degradation. Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a ring feeder, precutting forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground. Objectives of these experiments were to compare the effects of precutting alfalfa during round baling and conventional baling on heifer performance, forage wastage, and eating preference...|$|R
