25|$|On January 16, 2009, Dayton {{announced}} his candidacy for Governor of Minnesota. In a crowded Democratic field of challengers, Dayton chose {{to bypass the}} state caucuses and convention {{in favor of the}} primary election. He stated he <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> because the primary election is a more democratic method of choosing a candidate. Possibly due to his known dislike of fundraising for campaigns, he relied on personal funds for his campaign. On May 24, 2010, he announced State Senator Yvonne Prettner Solon of Duluth as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor. On August 10, 2010, Dayton defeated the DFL-endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher in a close primary election, 41.33% to 39.75%;) Dayton was later endorsed by the Minnesota DFL to earn his party's nomination for governor.|$|E
25|$|The {{weaknesses}} in Hooper's argument, Ridley's laconic and temperate rejoinder, and Ridley's {{offer of a}} compromise no doubt turned the council against Hooper's inflexible convictions {{when he did not}} accept it. Heinrich Bullinger, Pietro Martire Vermigli, and Martin Bucer, while agreeing with Hooper's views, ceased to support him for the pragmatic sake of unity and slower reform. Only Jan Laski remained a constant ally. Some time in mid-December 1550, Hooper was put under house arrest, during which time he wrote and published A godly Confession and protestacion of the Christian faith. Because of this publication, his persistent nonconformism, and violations of the terms of his house arrest, Hooper was placed in Thomas Cranmer's custody at Lambeth Palace for two weeks by the Privy Council on 13 January 1551. Hooper was then sent to Fleet Prison by the council, who <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> on 27 January. On 15 February, Hooper submitted to consecration in vestments in a letter to Cranmer. He was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester on 8 March 1551, and shortly thereafter, preached before the king in vestments.|$|E

500|$|The State Board of Education {{approved}} the site purchase in July 1855, but months later had proven {{unable to make}} any progress in deciding on basics for the college—including what buildings it might require. The Board turned to Holmes, who had continued to acquaint himself with the site by making some preliminary surveys. After some consideration, he reported back to the Board that the school required two main buildings: a combination classroom and office building, and a dormitory. Thus, John C. Holmes is {{the man responsible for}} the design of both College Hall and the original dormitory, now known as Saints' Rest. In addition, although Professor Harold W. Lautner (who, as the official Director of Campus Planning from 1945 to 1969, was a direct successor to Holmes) makes a point of noting that [...] "who proposed the sites for these first buildings is not answered in any record," [...] he concurs that Holmes' ubiquitous hand makes it unlikely that anyone else <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 game {{featured}} Notre Dame's {{return to}} bowl games after a 45-year self-imposed ban. When the Irish <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> 9–1 LSU was overlooked for the game, and the Tigers stayed home instead. The Irish, led by quarterback Joe Theismann, faced top-ranked and undefeated Texas. Notre Dame led 17–14 {{late in the}} fourth quarter, but the Longhorns scored a late touchdown to clinch a 21–17 victory and an undisputed national championship. The same two teams met the next year, but this time, the Irish ended the Longhorns' 30-game winning streak with a 24–11 victory, denying Texas the Associated Press national championship (the Longhorns had already clinched the regular season [...] championship in the UPI poll, a pre-bowl poll until the 1974 season; Nebraska won the AP title). Texas and Notre Dame met again in the 1978 game, with the Longhorns again top-ranked, only to see the Irish and quarterback Joe Montana roll to a 38–10 victory. The Irish vaulted from fifth to first in the final polls with the victory.|$|E
2500|$|The men's {{presentation}} was {{felt to be}} better, and Sir Alan told the girls that their product suffered from a myriad of small flaws such as the dice being largely needless, and the suits being in blue and pink when children often prefer to play among their own gender (although the girls {{pointed out that the}} prototyping company had <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> without consulting their team). However, it was pointed out that the collectables for the men's belt would have such high initial production costs that it would require a significant manufacturing lead time and would take an even longer time for the product to generate any profits (and thereby money for Comic Relief), meaning that while the men's execution of their task may have been better than the women's, and their product may have been the better of the two if it were being judged on a purely business basis, as a charity product it was completely worthless for Comic Relief's purposes, meaning that they lost the task. The women's team were [...] "rewarded" [...] by not having to work for Sir Alan any more (and, since this was the final Apprentice charity special, it meant the women's teams had a 100% victory rate across all three editions).|$|E
2500|$|Finally, then Police Chief David McCoy {{ordered the}} {{responding}} officers {{to arrest the}} Mayor, stating that he believed Thomas was [...] "a danger to himself and others". [...] Interestingly, Thomas was transported to the Henderson County Jail instead of the Gun Barrel City jail. [...] Chief David McCoy later told a local newspaper that he <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> because a nurse was on duty at the County Jail and he wanted Thomas to be monitored by a nurse. [...] Thomas was granted a phone call {{when he arrived at}} the Henderson County Jail. [...] It was approximately 2:00AM and Thomas called recently elected Justice of the Peace Dale Blaylock at home. [...] The phone call woke Judge Blaylock from his sleep, but Thomas nonetheless asked him to come to the jail right away and arraign him, presumably so Thomas could be released quickly. [...] It was reported in a local newspaper that Judge Blaylock immediately traveled at least thirty miles to the Henderson County Jail in Athens, Texas and arrived at approximately 3:00AM. [...] He arraigned Thomas first and set his bail at $500.00, the maximum allowed by law for the offense. [...] It was also reported that while Judge Blaylock was at the jail, he arraigned and set bond for all other inmates waiting to see a Judge the following day. [...] It was reported in the local newspaper that Thomas' father, Larry Ray Thomas, was waiting at the jail and posted the $500.00 cash bond only a few minutes after Judge Blaylock set his bail, and Thomas was immediately released.|$|E

2500|$|Irons {{performed}} {{with other members}} of Pearl Jam on Neil Young's 1995 album, Mirror Ball, and subsequently toured Europe as part of Young's backing band. With Irons, the band recorded its fourth studio album, No Code, released in 1996, for which Irons also toured. The band subsequently released Yield in 1998. [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. As a member of Pearl Jam, Irons brought a unique drumming style to the band, particularly in the way he played his fills and with his use of a trash can lid as a cymbal. Irons co-wrote the music for the No Code songs [...] "Who You Are", [...] "In My Tree", [...] "Red Mosquito", and [...] "I'm Open". He also wrote and sang on the Pearl Jam songs [...] "Happy When I'm Crying" [...] (from the 1997 fan club Christmas single), [...] "●" [...] (from Yield), and [...] "Whale Song" [...] (from the 1999 Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 3 compilation). He played with Pearl Jam through March 20, 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring.
