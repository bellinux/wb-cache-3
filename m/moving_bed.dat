How-ever, while kinetic theory based CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) {{has become a}} valuable design tool for modeling pilot plant scale gas-solid fluidized bed reactors, a fully re-solved simulation of industrial scale reactor is still nearly unfeasible. It is, therefore, common to use sub-grid models {{to account for the}} effect of the small unresolved structures on large resolved scales when using coarse grids. Further-more, state-of-the-art kinetic theory based CFD models for fluidized beds fail to predict the mass flow rates from hop-pers and <b>moving</b> <b>beds</b> correctly, where frictional contacts between the particles dominate. We present a comprehen-sive frictional-kinetic model for fluidized and <b>moving</b> <b>beds.</b> A sub-grid drag correlation accounts for the drag reduction due to the formation of sub-grid particle clusters. In ad-dition to a Âµi(Is) -rheology a dilation law is established in the frictional regime. Firstly, it is shown that in case of the coarse grid simulations the predicted bed expansion agrees excellently with fully resolved simulations.

40|$|Multi-phase flows can {{be found}} in a range of {{processes}} in vanous industries. Ironrnaking blast furnace is one of the typical examples. With high pulverized coal injection rates, complete combustion within the raceway of blast furnace becomes difficult, giving rise to a large amount of powder flow together with gases into the furnace. Thus, the performance of a modern blast furnace with high PCI strongly depends on the characteristics of a multiphase system which involves gas, powder, and liquid superimposed on the motion of solid particles. For this multiphase flow system, the solid (coke, sinter/pellets, etc) movement and liquids (hot metal and slag) and powders (unbumt coal and coke ash) accumulation in the lower region of the furnace are believed to play an important role. This thesis presents an experimental study focus on quantifying the hydrodynamics of gas-powder and gas-powder-liquid flows through packed beds with special reference to blast furnace. The effects of process variables including fluid flowrate and some material properties on powder hold-up, pressure gradient and phase interaction are examined. An experimental study of the hydrodynamics of gas-powder flow in packed beds has been carried out. Glass powder and spherical/non-spherical particles are used to simulate pulverized coal and coke particle respectively. It is found that solid motion, powder flowrate and particle spericity affect powder hold-up and pressure gradient significantly. New correlations are proposed for static and dynamic powder hold-ups to account for these effects based on experimental results. A hydrodynamic model is proposed for gas-powder flow in packed beds with spherical and non-spherical particles. Incorporation these correlations and porosity function into the existed Fanning and Ergun equations, the pressure gradients in fixed and <b>moving</b> <b>beds</b> can be reasonably estimated. The gas-powder-liquid flow through the <b>moving</b> <b>beds</b> is studied. The effects of fluid variables and some material properties on total powder hold-up and pressure gradients have been examined experimentally within the so-called operational regime. The normal and non-wetting treated glass beads, glass powder and water or mixture of water and glycerin are used to simulate coke, pulverized coal and hot metal/slag in a blast furnace. The results indicates that steady-state gas-powder-liquid flow in <b>moving</b> packed <b>beds</b> can be achieved under certain flow conditions since particle motion gives main contribution while it provides a higher bed porosity, enhances powder and liquid flow and removes the accumulation of the powder. The fluid variables and liquid viscosity significantly affect the total powder hold-up and hence pressure gradient but the wettability does not. Based on the experimental results, new correlations for powder hold-up and pressure gradient are proposed for blast furnace modelling in terms of dimensionless number of flowrates for different phases. Incorporation of these correlations and the existed empirical correlations of phase interactions, a hydrodynamic model is proposed to quantify the interaction force between liquid and powder. The results show that this force plays an important role for stable gas-powder-liquid flow in <b>moving</b> <b>beds</b> though it is ignored by most of the previous researchers...|$|R

This is where prep or process scale chromatography has a role. In contrast to analytical analysis, preparatory scale chromatography focuses on isolation and purity of compounds. There is a trade-off between the degree of purity of compound and the amount of time required to achieve that purity. Unfortunately, many of the preparatory or process scale solutions used by pharmaceutical companies are proprietary, due to difficulties in patenting a process. Hence, there is not a great deal of literature available. However, some attempts to address the problems of prep scale chromatography include monoliths and simulated <b>moving</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
