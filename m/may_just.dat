Rajab was accused of spreading false news and statements about the situation in Bahrain and promoting hatred and disrespect of a specific religious sect, in addition to humiliating the king of Bahrain. All the detainees were released the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble <b>may</b> <b>just</b> proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost a}} year of {{investigations}} against Uli Hoeneß, Bayern's former player, former long-time general manager, and president at the time, {{he was convicted of}} tax evasion on 13 March 2014. Hoeneß resigned as president the next day, and Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 <b>May.</b> <b>Just</b> days after Hoeneß conviction, on 25 March, Bayern won their 24th Bundesliga title by beating Hertha BSC 3–1 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record Bayern had set in the previous season. At {{the end of the season}} Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final to give the club the tenth league and cup double in its history. In 2014–15, Bayern defended their league title, and, the following season, won an 11th double, including a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Guardiola left Bayern to take over as manager of Manchester City and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.|$|E
5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan <b>may</b> <b>just</b> move from the high mountains to lower altitudes.

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or <b>may</b> <b>just</b> cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1914, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Verge enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps. He was subsequently attached to the 6th Light Horse Regiment as its medical officer. After completing rudimentary training in Sydney, his regiment embarked on HMAT A29 Suevic on 21 December, reaching Egypt on 1 February 1915. When the light horse regiments were sent to Gallipoli as reinforcements following the initial landing, Verge was attached to the 1st Australian Division. The reinforcements landed on 20 <b>May,</b> <b>just</b> after the failed Turkish attack on Anzac Cove. The 6th Light Horse Regiment was tasked with securing the right hand flank of the Allied lodgement, and during the months that followed undertook mainly defensive duties around the beachhead. The conditions on the peninsula were very harsh, and sanitation was poor. Several months after landing, Verge contracted dysentery and was evacuated to No. 17 British General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. He died on 8 September 1915, and was buried at the Chatby War Memorial Cemetery (Row Q, Grave No. 523) in Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|With {{no other}} way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $9.75 million in late 1954. While this gave DuMont a {{short-term}} cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont executives realized the company could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations. On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 and later moved to ABC. By <b>May,</b> <b>just</b> eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping {{what was left of the}} network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Ironically, Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS during the 1955-56 television season.|$|E
