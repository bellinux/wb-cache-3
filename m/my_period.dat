60|$|Here I {{will add}} that of this unhappy Cæsar and his brethren I {{remember}} little more. Dimly I seem to recollect that during <b>my</b> <b>period</b> of office some attack was made upon the prison {{by those who}} would have put the prince to death, but that I discovered the plot through the jailer who had introduced the poisoned figs, and defeated it with ease, thereby gaining much credit with Irene and her ministers. If so, of this plot history says nothing. All it tells of these princes is that afterwards a mob haled them to the Cathedral of St. Sophia and there proclaimed Nicephorus emperor. But they were taken again, and at last shipped to Athens, where they vanished from the sight of men.|$|E

'I dare hardly,' she said, 'tell you the {{situation}} of my feelings, they are so different from those usually ascribed to young women at <b>my</b> <b>period</b> of life; and I dare hardly touch upon what I conjecture to be the nature of yours, lest I should give offence where I would willingly administer consolation. For myself, from my infancy till this day I have had but one wish--the restoration of my royal benefactors to their rightful throne. It is impossible to express to you the devotion of my feelings to this single subject; and I will frankly confess that it has so occupied my mind as to exclude every thought respecting what is called my own settlement in life. Let me but {{live to see the}} day of that happy restoration, and a Highland cottage, a French convent, or an English palace will be alike indifferent to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|As for my Uncle Warrington, and his virtuous {{wife and}} daughters, {{let me do}} them justice likewise, and declare that {{throughout}} <b>my</b> <b>period</b> of trial, their sorrow at my poverty was consistent and unvarying. I still had a few acquaintances who saw them, and of course (as friends will) brought me a report of their opinions and conversation; and I never could hear that my relatives had uttered one single good word about me or my wife. They spoke even of my tragedy as a crime--I was accustomed to hear that sufficiently maligned--of the author as a miserable reprobate, for ever reeling about Grub Street, in rags and squalor. They held me out no hand of help. My poor wife might cry in her pain, {{but they had no}} twopence to bestow upon her. They went to church a half-dozen times in the week. They subscribed to many public charities. Their tribe was known eighteen hundred years ago, and will flourish as long as men endure. They will still thank Heaven that they are not as other folks are; and leave the wounded and miserable to other succour.|$|E

6000|$|No. I do {{not think}} I shall require to know the Gaelic; few things are written in that language, or ever were; {{if you come to}} that, the number of those who could write, or even read it, through almost all <b>my</b> <b>period,</b> must, by all accounts, have been {{incredibly}} small. Of course, until the book is done, I must live as much as possible in the Highlands, and that suits my book as to health. It is a most interesting and sad story, and from the '45 it is all to be written for the first time. This, of course, will cause me a far greater difficulty about authorities; but I have already learned much, and where to look for more. One pleasant feature is the vast number of delightful writers I shall have to deal with: [...] Burt, Johnson, Boswell, Mrs. Grant of Laggan, Scott. There will be interesting sections on the Ossianic controversy and the growth of the taste for Highland scenery. I have to touch upon Rob Roy, Flora Macdonald, the strange story of Lady Grange, the beautiful story of the tenants on the Forfeited Estates, and the odd, inhuman problem of the great evictions. The religious conditions are wild, unknown, very surprising. And three out of my five parts remain hitherto entirely unwritten. Smack! - Yours ever, ...|$|E

The thing is, whether, having done a figure of Bacchus, I may not {{be better able to}} do a likeness of Mr. Jones, when he comes to sit for his bust at the request of his admiring friends. For any further purpose that it will answer, Bacchus might just as well be broken up and carted away in the dust-cart." [...] To this, however, the two girls expressed their vehement opposition, and were of opinion that the time would come when Beelzebub and Bacchus, transferred to marble, would occupy places of honour in some well-proportioned hall built for the purpose of receiving them. [...] "I shall be quite content," [...] said Hamel, [...] "if the whole family of the Jones's will have their busts done about the size of life, and stand them up over their bookshelves. <b>My</b> <b>period</b> for Beelzebubs has gone by." [...] The visit, on the whole, was delightful. Lucy was contented with the almost more than divine beauty of her lover, and the two sisters, as they made their return journey to Kingsbury Crescent in another Hansom, discussed questions of art in a spirit that would have been delightful to any aspiring artist who might have heard them.|$|E
60|$|The reader {{may feel}} some curiosity {{to know how}} we fell on board the Dawn, during the five hours that elapsed between the firing {{of the first and}} the last guns, on this occasion; what was said among us, and how we {{proceeded}} as soon as the victory was decided. The last he will learn, in the regular course of the narrative; as for the first, it is soon told. It was not easy to find four men who were more impartial, as between the combatants, than those in the Dawn. My early preferences had certainly been in favour of England, as was very generally the case among all the better-educated Americans of <b>my</b> <b>period,</b> at least as low down as the war of 1812. But going beyond the scene of internal political discussion, and substituting observation for the eulogies and sophisms of the newspapers, had wrought divers changes in my opinion. England was then no more to me than any other nation; I was not of the French school of politics, however, and kept myself as much aloof from one of these foreign schools of political logicians as from the other. I may be said to have been born a Federalist; but this change of sentiment had prevented my ever giving a Federal vote since attaining my majority.|$|E

6000|$|And still to-day we {{have our}} great interpretations to make. Ours {{is a time of}} guesses, {{theories}} and provisional generalizations. Our phase corresponds to the cosmography that was still a little divided between discs and domes and spheres and cosmic eggs; that was still a thousand years from measuring and weighing a planet. For a long time my mind hovered about the stimulating theories of Socialism and particularly about those more systematic forms of Socialist teaching that centre about Karl Marx. He rose quite naturally out of those early economists who saw all {{the world in terms of}} production and saving. He was a necessary step for me at least, on the way to understanding. For a time I did so shape the world in my mind that it seemed to me no more than a vast enterprise for the organization and exploitation of labor. For a time I thought human life was essentially a labor problem, that working and controlling work and lending and selling and [...] "speculating" [...] made the essential substance of human life, over which the forms of politics ran as the stripes of a tiger's skin run and bend over its living muscles. I followed <b>my</b> <b>period</b> in thinking that. You will find in Ferrero's [...] "Roman Decline," [...] which was published early in this century, and which waits for you in the library, almost exactly the method of interpretation that was recommending itself to me in 1904 and 1905.|$|E

The 362nd was deployed from the Delta to the DMZ, providing long range Tropo-Scatter radio telephone communications throughout South Vietnam, with one site in Udorn Air Force Base in Thailand. In early 1964, the site in Ubon was no longer part of the 362nd Signal. By mid 1964, the 362nd operated Microwave Communications sites in Soc Trang, Vinh Long, Phulam (near Saigon), Nha Trang, Quinhon, Danang, Hue, Quang Ngai, Pleiku, Ban Me Thuot and Gia Ngia. In July, 1964, the 362n Signal Company had 216 Enlisted Men and 12 Officers. Operation Back Porch was the use of AN/MRC-85 Troposphere Scatter Microwave Communications Systems linking Saigon, Nha Trang, Quinhon and Danang, and linking Nha Trang to Pleiku and Ubon. The 362nd Signal also operated TRC-90 Microwave links joining Soc Trang to Vinh Long and Phulan, linking Phu Lam with Gia Ngia, Ban Me Thuot and Pleiku, linking Danang with Hue and Quang Ngai. The 362nd Signal was just about the first in and the last out of regular US Army company sized units deployed to South Vietnam.
