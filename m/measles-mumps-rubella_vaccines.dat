In postpubertal patients, its clinical course is more severe and may cause serious complications. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the clinical and laboratory outcome with therapy and the prognosis of mumps cases in our hospital. Material and Method: In this study, 131 patients diagnosed with mumps were evaluated regarding demographic and clinical characteristics between May 2007 and May 2008. Results: Of the patients, 74 (56 %) were male and 57 (44 %) were female, and the mean age of the patients was 7. 4 ± 3. 5 years (range, 9 months- 16 years). The incidence of mumps was higher in June (49 cases, 37 %). The most common complications were aseptic meningitis, epidydimo-orchitis and thrombocytopenia. Remission was obtained in all patients.

METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to receive (1) <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine,</b> varicella vaccine, and intranasal placebo on day 0, followed by 1 dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine on days 42 and 72; (2) measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and live attenuated influenza vaccines on day 0, {{followed by a}} second dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine on day 42 and intranasally administered placebo on day 72; or (3) 1 dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine on days 0 and 42, followed by <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> and varicella <b>vaccines</b> on day 72. Serum samples were collected before vaccination on days 0, 42, and 72. Reactogenicity events and adverse events were collected through day 41 after concurrent vaccinations and through day 10 after administration of live attenuated influenza vaccine or placebo alone. RESULTS: Among 1245 (99. 5 %) evaluable children, seroresponse rates and geometric mean titers for <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> and varicella vaccine were similar with concurrent administration of live attenuated influenza vaccine or placebo (seroresponse rates of > or = 96 % for <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> and > or = 82 % for varicella vaccine in both groups). Hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates to influenza strains in live attenuated influenza virus vaccine were similar after the vaccine was administered alone (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 92 %, and 44 % for H 3, B, and H 1 strains, respectively) or with <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> and varicella <b>vaccines</b> (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 96 %, and 43 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Measles, mumps and rubella are viral {{infections that}} cause high {{morbidity}} and mortality. Persistent vaccination {{resulted in the}} control of these infectious diseases in some European countries. In spite of this, the WHO target to eliminate measles and rubella by 2010 will not be met. Besides high vaccination coverage, vaccines that induce long-term protection are necessary to reach elimination. Published data on long-term immunity after MMR vaccination to sustain the possibility of elimination in European populations are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term persistence of vaccine-induced immunity against measles, mumps and rubella in a vaccinated student population {{and its impact on}} herd immunity. METHODS: In students with certified MMR vaccination records, humoral (serum antibody titres; n= 160) and cellular (lymphoproliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells; n= 48 of 160) immunity was measured up to 16 years after a first or second dose of MMR vaccine. RESULTS: Detectable antibodies against mumps and measles are significantly more prevalent in students who received 2 doses of MMR vaccine compared to subjects who received only 1 dose (measles: 77. 1 % vs 58. 7 %; mumps: 67. 5 % vs 55. 6 %). This was also the case for antibodies against rubella (99. 2 % vs 71. 4 %) but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Mumps specific lymphoproliferative responses can be elicited in vitro up to 16 years after the administration of one MMR dose (61. 5 %) as in two-dose schedules (72. 7 %), and in subjects with no or low antibody levels (54. 2 %) and high mumps-specific antibody levels (79. 2 %) at the time of blood sampling. CONCLUSIONS: The protective immunity of the <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccines</b> currently used in Europe are less sustainable for mumps than initially expected. Sustained cellular immunity may have no impact on protection against mumps [...] The combination of a lower than optimal MMR vaccination coverage with a suboptimal vaccine could result in future outbreaks. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} all general {{practitioners}} in Fife conducted {{prior to the}} introduction of measles-mumps-rubella immunization on a pilot basis in May 1987 showed that 85 % considered mumps worth preventing and 94 % believed the rubella programme worth augmenting with universal childhood immunization. Ninety seven per cent considered measles worth preventing and 98 % were prepared to recommend measles-mumps-rubella immunization to parents instead of measles vaccine. One year after introducing the <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> in Fife, 91 % of children had been immunized with the combined vaccine or measles vaccine before their second birthday.

40|$|Although child {{vaccination}} rates remain high, some parental concern persists that vaccines {{might cause}} autism. Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, {{which allows the}} entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the genesis {{of each of these}} theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence. A worldwide increase in the rate of autism diagnoses—likely driven by broadened diagnostic criteria and increased aware-ness—has fueled concerns that an environmental exposure like vaccines might cause autism.

50|$|Controversies in {{this area}} revolve around the {{question}} of whether the risks of adverse events following immunization outweigh the benefits of preventing infectious disease. There is some scientific evidence that immunizations can cause serious adverse effects, such as gelatin <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (MMR) causing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. Allegations particularly focus on disorders claimed to be caused by the MMR vaccine and thiomersal, a preservative used in vaccines routinely given to U.S. infants prior to 2001.

Response of lympho-cytes was determined by measurement {{of the amount of}} [14 Clthymidine incorporated by the cells. The impaired response to antigen lasted from one to five weeks after vaccination. There was no alteration in the number of either total or thymus-derived lymphocytes in the peripheral blood after vaccination. These results suggest that viral vaccination causes a depression of lymphocyte function rather than a depletion of functional lymphocytes. The delayed hypersensitivity response may be temporarily suppressed during viral illness [1, 2] or after vaccination [3, 4 J. An effect of virus on thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes has been pro-posed as one mechanism of this virus-induced anergy. Such an effect may be due to depletion of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood or to re-versible alteration of lymphocyte function. The recent availability of techniques for identification of T-Iymphocytes in peripheral blood permits examination of these possibilities.

Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site are common local reactions to vaccines. Fever and irritability may occur after some immunizations. Currently, no substantial evidence links <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> to autism, or hepatitis B vaccine to multiple sclerosis. Thimerosal is being eliminated from routine childhood vaccines because of concerns that multiple immunizations with vaccines containing this preservative could exceed recommended mercury exposures. Family physicians should be knowledgeable about vaccines so that they can inform their patients of the benefits of immunization and any proven risks. If immunization rates fall, the incidence of vaccine-preventable illnesses may rise. (Am Fam Physician 2002; 66 : 2113 - 20. Copyright© 2002 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

Other parents received no compensation because the government said that it was unproven that the MMR vaccine had been the cause; they decided to sue the manufacturer instead of the government. The Osaka district court ruled on 13 March 2003 that the death of two children (among numerous other serious conditions) had been indeed caused by Japan's strain of Urabe MMR. In 2006, the Osaka High Court stated in another ruling that the state was responsible for failing to properly supervise a manufacturer of the <b>measles-mumps-rubella</b> <b>vaccine,</b> which caused severe side effects in children.|$|R
