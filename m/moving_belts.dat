25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., <b>moving</b> <b>belts)</b> but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E

30|$|The second {{category}} {{refers to the}} situation that the <b>moving</b> <b>belts</b> switch to another column or row. When a transverse moving belt switches to another row, both previous row and current row need to update their DNs. When a longitudinal moving belt switches to another column, both previous column and current column need to update their DNs. The updating is relevant to the grid cell where the mobile sink is located before moving. The relationship of grid cell DN and GS is shown in Fig.  4. Namely, when mobile sink updates a grid cell’s DN, it only needs to update the head node of the grid cell. Thus, the local updating not only reduces the update area but also reduces {{the number of the}} updated sensor nodes.|$|E
