5|$|In May 1940, during World War II, the United Kingdom {{initiated}} {{an invasion}} of politically neutral Iceland, fearing it would otherwise fall to the forces of Nazi Germany which had recently conquered Denmark. Iceland's indigenous population was generally opposed to the British occupation, instead preferring troops of the United States, which was neutral at that phase in the war. Iceland signed a defense agreement with the United States in which United States troops would be stationed on the island nation. The U.S. <b>Marine</b> Corps hastily assembled the 1st Provisional <b>Marine</b> Brigade in Charleston, South Carolina, to move to Iceland {{as part of the}} agreement. The brigade was first activated on 14 July 1941. Its elements were taken from the 2nd <b>Marine</b> Division, which was training at <b>Marine</b> Corps Base San Diego and Camp Elliott, both in San Diego, California. This brought the force up to a strength of 4,095 men. They were the first of 28,000 men occupying Iceland under Major General Holland M. Smith and his 1st <b>Marine</b> Division. While the 1st <b>Marine</b> Division was building its forces, though, the Provisional Brigade would hold Iceland. However, priorities soon changed and the 1st <b>Marine</b> Division was moved elsewhere. The 1st Provisional <b>Marine</b> Brigade was instead joined by units of the United States Army.|$|E
