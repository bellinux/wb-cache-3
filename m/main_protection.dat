25|$|The main {{projectile}} weapon used in Goguryeo was the bow. The bows were {{modified to}} be more composite and increase throwing ability on par with crossbows. To a lesser extent, stone-throwing machines and crossbows were also used. Polearms, used against the cavalry and in open order, were mostly spears. Two types of swords were used by Goguryeo warriors. The first was a shorter double-edged variant mostly used for throwing. The other was longer single-edged sword with minimal hilt and ring pommel, of obvious eastern han influence. The helmets were similar to helmets used by Central Asian peoples, decorated with wings, leathers and horsetails. The shield was the <b>main</b> <b>protection,</b> which covered most of the soldier's body. These cavalry were called Gaemamusa (개마무사, 鎧馬武士), which is similar type with that of Cataphract.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{debates over}} its legal status, the Petition of Right was highly influential. Domestically, the Petition {{is seen as}} [...] "one of England's most famous {{constitutional}} documents", of equal value to the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights 1689. In {{a period in which}} Charles's <b>main</b> <b>protection</b> from the Commons was the House of Lords, the willingness of both chambers to work together marked a new stage in the constitutional crisis that would eventually lead to the English Civil War. The Petition remains in force in the United Kingdom and, thanks to Imperial legislation, many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations including Australia and New Zealand. Internationally, it helped influence the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, and is seen as a predecessor to the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh amendments to the Constitution of the United States.|$|E
500|$|With the {{exception}} of the deck armor, 8-inch turrets and conning tower—which consisted of conventional nickel steel—the Indiana class was protected with the new Harvey armor. Its <b>main</b> <b>protection</b> was a belt [...] thick, placed along two thirds of the length of the hull from [...] above to [...] under the waterline. Beyond this point, the belt gradually grew thinner until it ended [...] under the waterline, where the belt was only [...] thick. Below the belt the ship had no armor, only a double bottom. On both ends the belt was connected to the barbettes of the main guns with [...] armored bulkheads. In the waterline sections outside this central citadel, compartments were filled with compressed cellulose, intended to self-seal when damaged. Between the deck and the main belt, 5-inch hull armor was used. The deck armor was [...] thick inside the citadel and [...] outside it. The hollow conning tower was a single forging 10inches thick. The 13-inch gun battery had [...] of vertical turret plating and [...] barbettes, while the 8-inch cannons only had 6inches of vertical turret plating and [...] barbettes. The casemates protecting the 6-inch guns were 5inches thick and the other casemates, lighter guns, shell hoists and turret crowns were all lightly armored.|$|E

50|$|A 2010 Cochrane review {{concluded}} that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether barrier cream could prevent irritant contact dermatitis in the workplace. Barrier creams can be applied before exposure to potential irritants, but are not typically used as the <b>main</b> <b>protection</b> against hazardous substances. They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers; in particular, gloves provide greater protection. However barrier creams are reasonably effective for protection of the face against some airborne substances. Active barrier creams containing silicone, tartaric acid, glycerin, and other ingredients are said to be beneficial for some chromate-sensitive construction workers.|$|E

The US Navy prefers that Aegis equipped units should be kept in close proximity to the units of high value, with less able AAW units no more than 10 nautical miles (19 km) out along the threat axis with, if possible, further AAW assets 18 to 24 nautical miles (33 to 44 km) out.|$|E
50|$|Peltasts {{carried a}} {{crescent-shaped}} wicker shield called a pelte (Latin: peltarion) as their <b>main</b> <b>protection,</b> hence their name.

It also appears in Scythian art {{and may have been}} a common type in Central Europe. The shield could be carried with a central strap and a hand grip near the rim or with just a central hand-grip. It may also have had a carrying strap (or baldric) as Thracian peltasts slung their shields on their backs when evading the enemy. Peltasts' weapons consisted of several javelins (akontia), which may have had throwing straps to allow more force to be applied to a throw.|$|E
