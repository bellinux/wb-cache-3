5000|$|Most EU {{countries}} {{have experienced a}} decline in church attendance, {{as well as a}} {{decline in the number of}} people professing belief. The 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that, on average, 51% of the citizens of the EU Member States state that they believe there is a God, 26% state that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 20% state that they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer. According to a recent study (Dogan, Mattei, Religious Beliefs in Europe: Factors of Accelerated Decline), 47% of French people declared themselves as agnostics in 2003. The situation of religion varies between countries in European Union. A decrease in religiousness and church attendance in Western Europe (especially in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic) has been noted and called [...] "Post-Christian Europe". Also, in the most populous Eastern European country and EU <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>Poland</b> there has been a sharp reduction in church attendance since 2005, although with 41.5% in 2009 it is still well above the single digit figures that are so typical for Sunday service attendance in other EU countries.|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} a critical legal {{perspective on the}} current direction of EU food regulation. Analysing three regulatory mechanisms - mutual recognition, scientific risk regulation and standardisation - {{in the evolution of}} food legislation in the EU, the book shows the inadequacy of the current framework in facing the challenges of enlargement. Using the particular experience of a new <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>Poland,</b> the book argues that enlarged Europe must not disregard diverse socio-economic implications of market regulation. Due to historical legacies and a bias in favour of homogeneity, EU food regulatory regime has generated a one-dimensional crisis-oriented approach. As a result, it tends to overlook other legitimate concerns such as quality, diversity and local traditions. This book argues that this need not be so.

The analysis utilizes both disaggregate and aggregate price data, including the prices of 157 products and two indices constructed using two different weighting procedures. For each category of goods the price dispersion is lower in EU 15 than EU 15 plus 3 NMS. Sigma convergence measured as a decline in the standard deviation over time is rejected. Unit root tests reject the validity of the Law of One Price (LOOP) for most of the estimations of indices but confirm the LOOP for individual goods.

40|$|The project {{intended}} {{to explain the}} causes of high structural unemployment in Poland. It is generally believed that {{the high level of}} unemployment in Poland is determined to a decisive degree by factors such as a restrictive labor code, high degree of unionization and/or the unemployment benefits system. The research provides macroeconomic and microeconomic evidence that the employment consequences of a tax wedge can be more severe for the low-skilled. Consequently, it argues that a high tax wedge can be potentially more harmful in countries abundant in this kind of labour. These results should send a strong message to policymakers, especially those in Central and Eastern Europe. The project was financed by a research grant provided by the Ministry of Education and Science, Poland and conducted by a team of CASE researchers: Marek Gora (coordinator), Mateusz Walewski, Artur Radziwill and Agnieszka Sowa.

This paper {{draws on}} the {{conclusions}} of an international research project on EU Enlargement and Multi-level Governance in European Regional and Environment Policies. The project’s main goal was twofold: first, to evaluate the impact of Europeanization of public policy on the governance structures of three traditionally unitary countries (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), and their response, in terms of learning and adaptation, to the European environment in the regional and environmental policies; and second, to identify the appropriate reforms that new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Poland</b> and Hungary) should undertake, {{in order to facilitate}} the adaptation and adjustment of their public policy structures to the European environment. Focus is given to institutional formal and informal networks that sustain the policy-making process and its relation to EU policy, which were analyzed with SNA methods, namely, density, centrality and structural equivalence measures. This methodology allowed the research to identify points of resistance to change and to assess the level of expertise involved in the policy-making process and subsequently of the presence of relevant forms of governance. More centralized networks (Ireland and Poland; Portugal in regional policy; Hungary in environmental policy) were associated with the concentration of power in state actors; More dense networks (Ireland, Poland and Portugal), however, enabled better levels of informational flows and knowledge exchange. Structural equivalence revealed pattern similarities among central state actors on the one hand, and more peripheral ones on the other. On the basis of these findings, a new research program is proposed to address unanswered questions, with recourse to more sophisticated SNA methods...|$|R
