5000|$|A higher {{yielding}} synthesis {{involves a}} four-step process. In the first step, molybdenum(V) chloride {{is reduced by}} acetonitrile (CH3CN) to give MoCl4(CH3CN)2. Acetonitrile is displaced by tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give MoCl4(thf)2. This Mo(IV) compound is reduced by tin powder to MoCl3(thf)3.

40|$|Azoxyarenes on {{treatment}} with hydrazine hydrate in presence of <b>magnesium</b> <b>turnings</b> in methanol undergo reduction. The reactions {{have been carried}} under microwave irradiation {{as well as at}} reflux to give the corresponding hydrazoarenes and azoarenes as reduced products.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of some novel alkyl/aryl substituted tertiary alcohols was accomplished in two steps. The synthetic route involves preparation of Grignard reagents by treating alkyl/aryl bromides with <b>magnesium</b> <b>turnings</b> in dry ether. Then substituted chalcones were reacted with the Grignard reagents to afford alkyl/aryl substituted tertiary alcohols 1 - 10. The {{structures of the}} synthesized compounds were assigned {{on the basis of}} FT-IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and mass spectroscopic data. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated using the carrageenan-induced hind paw edema method and was compared with that of ibuprofen. Some of the newly synthesized compounds showed promising anti-inflammatory activity. The tertiary alcohols 1 - 10 were also screened for antibacterial activity against ten bacterial strains using seven Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacteria and for antifungal activity against Aspergillus Flavus, Aspergillus Niger and Aspergillus pterus. Tertiary alcohols 1 - 10 were found to exhibit good to excellent antimicrobial activities compared to levofloxacin and fluconazole used as standard drugs...|$|E
500|$|The {{propelling}} charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape {{to three or}} four cartridges of ammonal explosive. This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. [...] of <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>turnings</b> were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The {{propelling charge}}s were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about [...] away. Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery.|$|R
500|$|Experiments {{with the}} flame fougasse {{continued}} and it rapidly evolved. The fuel mixture {{was at first}} 40% petrol and 60% gas-oil, a mixture calculated to be useless as a vehicle fuel. A concoction of tar, lime, and petrol gel known as 5B was also developed. [...] "5B was dark coloured, sticky, smooth paste which burned fiercely for many minutes, stuck easily to anything with which it came in contact and did not flow on burning." [...] Early flame fougasse designs had a complex arrangement of explosive charges: a small one at the front to ignite the fuel and a main charge at the back to throw the fuel forward. An important discovery was that including <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>turnings</b> (the waste product of machining magnesium pieces in a lathe) with the main charge {{at the rear of}} the barrel would give reliable ignition. This eliminated the need for a separate ignition charge and its associated wiring. The alloy of about 90% magnesium and 10% aluminium was, at the time, known under the trade name Elektron.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study regarding {{the influence of}} microwave irradiation on {{the formation of a}} series of Grignard reagents in terms of rates and selectivities has revealed that these heterogeneous reactions may display a beneficial microwave effect. The interaction between microwaves and <b>magnesium</b> <b>turnings</b> generates violent electrostatic discharges. These discharges on magnesium lead to melting of the magnesium surface, thus generating highly active magnesium particles. As compared to conventional operation the microwave-induced discharges on the magnesium surface lead to considerably shorter initiation times for the insertion of magnesium in selected substrates (i. e. halothiophenes, halopyridines, octyl halides, and halobenzenes). Thermographic imaging and surface characterization by scanning electron microscopy showed that neither selective heating nor a specific microwave effect was causing the reduction in initiation times. This novel and straightforward initiation method eliminates the use of toxic and environmentally adverse initiators. Thus, this initiation method limits the formation of by-products. We clearly demonstrated that microwave irradiation enables fast Grignard reagent formation. Therefore, microwave technology is promising for process intensification of Grignard based coupling reactions...|$|E
40|$|MgO fibers {{have been}} {{fabricated}} in-house using the sol-gel route. In the process, <b>magnesium</b> <b>turnings</b> were added with methanol to produce magnesium methoxide. Ethylene glycol was then {{added to the}} mixture and stirred continuously to form the desired gels. The gels were extruded and heat treated to produce the cylindrical shape MgO fibers. Small weight percentage of 3 % to 8 % MgO fibers were added to Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi- 2212) superconductor powder. The Bi- 2212 /MgO fibers compounds were palletized and heat treated through partial- melt process, followed by slow cooling. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy dispersive x-ray (EDAX), and dc electrical resistance measurements at zero magnetic fields. Compression tests were conducted to study the mechanical behavior of the samples. From the characterization results, additions of small amount of MgO fibers improved {{the texture of the}} Bi- 2212 /MgO fibers compounds. Significantly higher stiffness, strength and toughness were observed in the compounds with 5 % MgO fibers addition...|$|E
