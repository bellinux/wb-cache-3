5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last {{cartridge}} is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is {{now ready to}} reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> spring. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|R
50|$|The straight-line layout {{allowed the}} <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and buffer to run {{directly}} {{back into the}} buttstock and reduce the overall length of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|Garand's {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 used a complicated gas system involving a special muzzle extension gas trap, later dropped {{in favor of a}} simpler drilled gas port. Because most of the older rifles were retrofitted, pre-1939 gas-trap M1s are very rare today and are prized collector's items. In both systems, expanding gases from a fired cartridge are diverted into the gas cylinder. Here, the gases meet a long-stroke piston attached to the <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> which is pushed rearward by the force of this high-pressure gas. Then, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> engages a rotating bolt inside the receiver. The bolt is attached to the receiver via two locking lugs, which rotate, unlock, and initiate the ejection of the spent cartridge and the reloading cycle when the rifle is discharged. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> (and subsequently the bolt) then returns to its original position.|$|R
5000|$|The AK-107, AK-108, and AK-109 {{represent}} {{a significant change}} to the Kalashnikov operating system originally designed in the late 1940s. This system uses a recoil-reducing countermass mechanism with two <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> that move in opposite directions, thereby providing [...] "balance". One <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> the upper, has a gas piston facing forward while the lower also has a gas piston. The gas tube at the forward end of the handguard is double-ended to accommodate the two rods. The enlarged gas tube cover of the upper handguard guides both rods in their travel.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{gas system}}: The unique direct gas system {{eliminates}} the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and keeps {{all of the}} firing forces {{in line with the}} bore for maximum accuracy and reliability.|$|R

50|$|Unskilled use of {{the tool}} will often detach the lock rods, leaving the lock {{inoperable}} even with the key. This is often a clue that someone has attempted to break into a car. Newer cars have also incorporated internal defenses against this tool such as barrier blocks {{on the bottom of}} the window, preventing entry, and also shrouding the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> and the lock cylinder to prevent manipulation of internal linkages. Others have designed the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> to be easily disconnected when engaged with a lateral force - as is often created by the lifting action of the tool.|$|R
25|$|Drive {{was from}} the {{camshaft}} <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> of an Austro-Daimler engine via a wormgear. The early Schwarzlose gun had a synchronized rate of 360 rounds per minute with this gear – this was later boosted to 380 rounds with the MG16 model.|$|R
50|$|The {{pantograph}} was, {{in keeping}} with most pantographs at the time, spring operated with an elementary head suspension. It featured needle roller bearings at the base and knuckle. The <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were cleverly hidden inside the hollow arms making an excellent aesthetically pleasing design.|$|R

25|$|On 3 July 1968, Trident 1s G-ARPI and G-ARPT {{were struck}} by Airspeed Ambassador G-AMAD, which crashed at London Heathrow Airport due {{to the failure of}} a flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod.</b> G-ARPI was {{severely}} damaged, but repaired and returned to service, whereas G-ARPT was written off. However, 4 years later, G-ARPI would be lost.|$|R
50|$|The port (left) flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> {{had failed}} due to metal fatigue. While the {{mechanism}} had failed, the compensating mechanism {{between the two}} sets of flaps remained intact. The port flaps had retracted but the compensator caused the starboard ones to extend further. The resulting asymmetry of lift resulted in the roll to port.|$|R
50|$|The Mini Nimbus range all feature self-connecting controls, of Glasflügel design, {{for added}} safety {{and ease of}} rigging, and have been {{incorporated}} in all newer Schempp-Hirth models. The trim lever {{is connected to the}} flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and needs to be set only once per flight; thereafter changes in flap setting (-7 to +10 degrees) automatically provides trim compensation.|$|R

2500|$|A {{product of}} Troy Industries the CAR 14 (Carbine Assault Rifle 14) is a smaller and lighter {{tactical}} {{version of the}} M14. [...] Its barrel is 12.5 inches long and it weighs 7.9 pounds. The rifle has select fire ability, a threaded flash suppressor for a suppressor, a tactical rail on top for sights and other attachments, and the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> cover.|$|R
50|$|Though unconventional, the Jackhammer {{can best}} be {{described}} as a gas-operated revolver. Many parts were constructed of Rynite polymer to reduce weight. Layout was of a bullpup configuration with a 10-round revolving cylinder that fired conventional, 12-gauge shells. The cylinder's method of rotation was very similar to the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver, an <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> being used to rotate the cylinder.|$|R
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The HK-proprietary {{gas system}} uses a piston driving an <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> {{to control the}} {{function}} of the bolt, preventing propellant gases and the associated carbon fouling from entering the weapon’s interior. This increases the reliability of the weapon and extends the interval between stoppages. It also reduces operator cleaning time, heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and wear and tear on critical components.|$|R
50|$|M1: Harrington & Richardson was {{assigned}} serial number ranges 4660001 through 4800000, 5488247 through 5793847, and 400 rifles numbered from 6034330 through 6034729. The major components, {{such as the}} barrel, bolt, hammer, <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> safety, and trigger housing were stamped with a numeric drawing number and the manufacturer's initials. Harrington & Richardson rifles are marked HRA on all marked parts except the receivers, which were stamped H&R ARMS CO.|$|R
50|$|Having {{established}} its <b>main</b> <b>operating</b> base at Northolt, BEA operated {{its first}} service from Heathrow in April 1950; by late 1954, all Northolt operations {{had moved to}} Heathrow, which remained the airline's <b>main</b> <b>operating</b> base until the merger with BOAC in 1974.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, expeditionary air wings were {{established}} at the RAF's <b>main</b> <b>operating</b> bases.

5000|$|The pilot {{probably}} {{tried to}} overshoot {{and set the}} flaps to the correct 10 degrees, but due to the mechanism design this was not sufficient to cause the starboard flaps to retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event). The Department of Transport report concluded that whatever the pilot's actions, it was [...] "doubtful" [...] whether an accident could have been avoided. After the accident all Ambassadors were fitted with steel reinforcements to the flap <b>operating</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous or {{electrically}} stimulated {{activity of}} the uterus is measured isometrically in vitro by integrating tension against time. Uterine contractions move the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> of a potentiometer transducer, the output voltage from which is coupled to an electrical integrator motor and a servo recorder. Several parameters of uterine activity can be expressed in a single measurement, and a record of isometric contractions is obtained simultaneously. Oxytocin can be assayed accurately {{and the effect of}} drugs on uterine motility can be measured...|$|R
50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the regulator valves located on its saturated steam side. The regulator spindle {{passed through the}} smokebox side and the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were led along the left-hand side of the boiler to the cab. Steam was fed to the superheater header through a 7 in diameter internal steam pipe from a standpipe in the shallow dome. As an experiment, two of the engines were equipped with patent steam driers, fitted in the dome.|$|R
5000|$|Colt {{says that}} by {{allowing}} the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> to wiggle the downward force is alleviated and shifted rearward instead. [...] Conversely, Adams Arms cites loose or sloppy tolerances inside the receiver as root {{source of the problem}} and thus utilizes a single-piece carrier to solve the problem. Other companies solve this issue modifying the carrier length. Black Rifle Arms utilizing a shorted carrier to accommodate a polymer based buffer and Patriot Ordnance Factory using a lengthened carrier, sporting an extended lower lip.|$|R
