40|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>molds</b> {{used for}} PFGE can be {{expensive}} to purchase and often physically and experimentally inflexible. The use of plastic primer container covers as <b>plug</b> <b>molds</b> for Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) is reported in this study. These plastic covers are cheap, effective and easy-to-use for processing samples for electrophoresis. Besides, the broad surface and flat area in the mold promotes faster cooling and the agar sets quickly at room temperature. Plugs are also easily removed with a spatula. These containers can be easily cleaned for re-use or disposed of as waste. Twenty samples can be prepared in one container. The PFGE results obtained by using these plastic primer-container covers as <b>plug</b> <b>molds</b> {{are similar to the}} PFGE results obtained by using commercial <b>plug</b> <b>molds...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 and was built by Leisure-Time Fiberglass Products, although very few were built. The molds were made by using an existing Sanibel 18 boat hull as a fiberglass <b>mold</b> <b>plug.</b> It has a length overall of 17.83 ft, a waterline length of 15.00 ft, displaces 1300 lb and carries 400 lb of ballast. The boat has a draft of 4.00 ft with the centerboard down and 1.00 ft with it up. The boat has a hull speed of 5.19 kn.|$|R

5000|$|The Federal Circuit {{described}} <b>plug</b> <b>molding</b> {{technology in}} these terms, in its {{decision in the}} Interpart case, discussed below:The California <b>plug</b> <b>molding</b> statute...proscribes use of the product itself for a pattern or [...] "plug" [...] in a direct molding process. In that process, the product is entirely coated with a mold-forming substance that sets and which is then removed from the product and used as the mold for making numerous replicas of the product. This process is substantially less expensive than developing a mold from scratch, something the original product manufacturer has to do.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Circuit {{had reached}} a {{contrary}} result in Interpart Corp. v. Italia, upholding a California law prohibiting <b>plug</b> <b>molding.</b> The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.|$|R
50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires <b>molds,</b> <b>plug</b> assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R
50|$|Special modular plugs {{have been}} {{manufactured}} (for example, the Siemon UP-2468) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, {{to accommodate the}} wider jack's outermost contacts without damage. These special plug connectors can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots <b>molded</b> into the <b>plug.</b> The <b>molded</b> plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe goods made of light-gage metal blocks {{providing}} for threaded attachment of different components have currently been {{widely used in}} mechanical engineering. The problem of ensuring strength of such connections consists in achieving a sufficient screwing length {{providing for}} three-five thread turns. Such methods as plate bending, welding of nuts, <b>molding</b> of <b>plugs</b> and deformation of metal blocks in closed press tools are applied to increase the screwing length. All these methods are insufficiently advanced and require application of additional equipment and consumables. This problem can be solved by forming tap holes by thermal drilling, when the material of the hole is not removed with chips but used for flanging, thus, ensuring sufficient screwing length. This article considers the mechanism of flanging formation by the rotating punch, interconnection between geometrical dimensions of flanging and process simulation by means of ANSYS software package...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{thickness}} reduction of extruded plates with high impact polystyrene (HIPS) used in the manufacturing of domestic refrigerators boxes on the final quality of the pieces, raw material and energy consumption and productivity was assessed. The plates were extruded with a reduced thickness and processed in the internal boxes by thermoforming process. A non-uniform distribution of the PSAI, resulting in boxes with thick outside the internal standards required has been observed. To solve this problem, <b>molding</b> auxiliaries (<b>plugs</b> made of Felt, Ambatex and Teflon) were applied in the points of major complexity in the thermoforming of boxes and Six Sigma tools, mechanical and thermal cycling tests were applied to evaluate their quality. A comparison between the consumption of raw materials and energy and productivity before and after reduction of the sheets thickness {{and use of the}} plugs were performed. The best results were observed for molded parts with the use of Felt plugs. A reduction of 4. 5 % in raw material consumption, increasing productivity of 103 sheets per day in the extruder, 247 internal boxes per day in the thermoforming machine and reduction in energy consumption in the pre-heating of 8 % and heating of 17 % were obtained...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>molding</b> {{statutes}} {{have been}} challenged as {{interfering with the}} federal patent system and therefore preempted by federal law. In 1985 in Interpart Corp. v. Italia, the Federal Circuit upheld the California anti-plug molding law against a preemption challenge, when it was invoked to stop copying of an automobile rear view mirror. The court said that the law [...] "prevents unscrupulous competitors from obtaining a product and using it as the 'plug' for making a mold." [...] The Federal Circuit insisted {{that there is no}} [...] "right to copy." [...] It therefore concluded:The California law does not [...] "clash" [...] with the federal patent law; the two laws have different objectives. ...We see nothing in the federal patent statutes that conflicts with California's desire to prevent a particular type of competition which it considers unfair.|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to design vacuum forming machine which is capable of {{producing}} "Small plant growing Horticultural HIPS tray" in a economical speed. these trays has high demand in all over the world's horticultural industry but used thermo-forming as a manufacturing process which tooling cost quite high compared with vacuum forming. at the same time small quantity of product not accepted by the manufactures and simple epoxy moulds and wood mould can't used in this thermoforming machine. at the same time European made thermoforming machine is high expensive compared with normal roll feed vacuum forming machines. so my aim was to design vacuum forming machine which is capable of producing this type of product at a economical way. This research aimed to design most critical components of this vacuum forming machine with clear understanding of it's practical operational requirement. Basically heater oven; vacuum system; <b>mold</b> and <b>plug</b> moving system and mould design covered in this research. High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) used as the plastic material for this "Horticulture tray production" and this machine capable of using.
