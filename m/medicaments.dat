5|$|Pliny the Elder's (23–79 CE) encyclopaedic Naturalis Historia (c. 77–79 CE) is a {{synthesis}} of {{the information contained in}} about 2000 scrolls and it includes myths and folklore; there are about 200 extant copies of this work. It comprises 37 books of which sixteen (Books 12–27) are devoted to trees, plants and <b>medicaments</b> and, of these, seven describe medicinal plants. In medieval herbals, along with De Materia Medica it is Pliny's work that is the most frequently mentioned of the classical texts, even though the work De Simplicibus of Galen (131–201 CE) is more detailed and notable. Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages, probably illustrated in the original, was that attributed to Apuleius and this also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages. It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE.|$|E
5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and <b>medicaments</b> the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{authoritative}} clinicians {{and researchers}} advise completing endodontic therapy {{as soon as}} possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay. [...] Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain <b>medicaments</b> prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of chlorhexidine gluconate and calcium hydroxide for infection control was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.|$|E

[...] Periodic application and renewal of calcium hydroxide over a year’s time (four applications over a 12-month period), has been shown to represent a nonsurgical approach to resolving even extensive inflammatory periapical lesions.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) is {{an acute}} infective disease of a zoonose type {{characterized by an}} abrupt beginning, prominent hemorrhagic syndrome as well as symptoms and signs of acute renal insufficiency. The clinical picture of this disease, which is leading {{in terms of its}} natural principal seat in the region of Northern-east Montenegro, ranges from non-apparent to very severe forms and mortality it causes is about 10 %. Up to date, no efficient etio-trophic means has been discovered. Several studies suggest that an early use of anti virus <b>medicament</b> Ribavirine leads to decrease of mortality rate. The main aim {{of this study is to}} present our results achieved in an attempt to apply this <b>medicament</b> in treating HFRS. Material and methods. In total, we have treated 58 patients with symptoms and signs of HGSBS. Five of them, who were admitted to the Department in the first three days were treated by Ribavirine orally in doses of 2 x 400 mg. Compared to patients who were not treated by Ribavirine, a faster decrease of thrombocytes was noticed in them, which required the discontinuation of the <b>medicament</b> treatment. Thereafter, thrombocytes started to increase and their normalization followed faster than in patients who were not treated by this <b>medicament.</b> The above patients developed a moderately severe clinical picture of the disease, and middle maximum values of urea and creatinine were lower in patients who were not treated by the <b>medicament.</b> No patient developed a severe form of the disease and there were neither dialyzed nor died ones. The mortality rate in patients who were not treated by the <b>medicament</b> was 3. 44 % and the percent of the dialyzed was 5. 17 %. Results. Application of Ribavirine at the very beginning of HFRS is considered to be with a very good reason in combination with obligatory follow up of clinical and laboratory parameters and particularly of thrombocyte values, the decrease of which can lead to spontaneous bleedings.
