This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry.

According to legends, chancellor Zhuge Liang encountered the problem of feeding his soldiers after they lost their woks. He ordered the cooks to <b>mix</b> <b>water</b> with wheat flour to make batter, then spread it on shields, or flat copper griddles over a flame. The dish raised the soldiers’ morale and helped them win the battle. After that, jianbing was passed down through generations in Shandong province and gradually spread to different parts of China.|$|E

Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to <b>mix</b> <b>water</b> into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E

2500|$|However, Lucretius, {{describing}} atomism in his De rerum natura, gives {{very clear}} and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate [...] "pure" [...] materials like water, air, and metals. The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has {{everything in the world}} not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of [...] "atoms". These classical [...] "atoms" [...] are nearer to humans' modern concept of [...] "molecule" [...] than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these [...] "atoms": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.|$|E

60|$|The taro root {{looks like}} a thick, or, if you please, a corpulent sweet potato, in shape, but is of a light purple color when boiled. When boiled it answers as a {{passable}} substitute for bread. The buck Kanakas bake it under ground, then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle, <b>mix</b> <b>water</b> with it until it becomes a paste, set it aside and let if ferment, and then it is poi--and an unseductive mixture it is, almost tasteless before it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward. But nothing is more nutritious. When solely used, however, it produces acrid humors, a fact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the Kanakas. I think there must be {{as much of a}} knack in handling poi as there is in eating with chopsticks. The forefinger is thrust into the mess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out, thickly coated, just as it it were poulticed; the head is thrown back, the finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and swallowed--the eye closing gently, meanwhile, in a languid sort of ecstasy. Many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a different kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the virtues of its contents.|$|E

The acidity of peat water can damage the quality and service life of concrete in the long term. The addicid of the added material such as oil ash or Palm Oil Fuel Ash (POFA) may increase the formation of calcium silicate hydrate as a gel adhesive concrete. This study aims to measure the mechanical properties such as compressive strength, tensile strength and modulus elasticity of concrete with a compressive strength of 35 MPa. Concrete compressive strength OPC and OPC + 10 % POFA using peat <b>water</b> as <b>mixing</b> <b>water</b> has decreased by 8. 33 % and 6. 33 % of the compressive strength of normal concrete. The results of tensile strength and modulus of elasticity sides show strong results {{in line with the}} press.

50|$|For {{controlling}} primary efflorescence, formulations containing liquid {{fatty acid}} mixtures (e.g., oleic acid and linoleic acid) have been commonly used. The oily liquid admixture is {{introduced into the}} batch mix {{at an early stage}} by coating onto the sand particles prior to the introduction of any <b>mix</b> <b>water,</b> so that the oily admixture is distributed uniformly throughout the concrete batch mix.|$|E
50|$|For {{controlling}} secondary efflorescence, admixtures containing aqueous-based {{calcium stearate}} dispersion (CSD) are often added {{at a later}} stage of the batching process with the <b>mix</b> <b>water.</b> In a typical batching process, sand is first charged into the mixer, then the oil-based primary anti-efflorescence admixture is added with constant mixing to allow the oil to coat the sand. Then coarse aggregates, colorants, and cement are added, followed by water. If CSD is used, it is then introduced usually at this point during or after {{the addition of the}} <b>mix</b> <b>water.</b> CSD is an aqueous dispersion wherein fine solid particles of calcium stearate are suspended in the water uniformly. Commercially available CSD has an average particle size of about 1 to 10 micrometres. The uniform distribution of CSD in the mix may render the resulting concrete masonry unit water repellent, as CSD particles are well distributed in the pores of the unit to interfere with the capillary movement of water.|$|E

Aerial photo-interpretation followed by conventional field check and laboratory analyses were integrated with the GIS to provide a suitable base map for the study. The main physical and chemical characteristics of 52 soil profiles, representing the different mapping units, were stored into ILWIS GIS.
