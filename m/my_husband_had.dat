You got all your fingers and toes today?' It would scare me. I'd have to become a police officer and work with him; I couldn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was a stupid thing to do but I think it was just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King, Jr. {{were married}} on June 18, 1953, {{on the lawn}} of her mother's house; the {{ceremony}} was performed by Martin Jr.'s father, Martin Luther King, Sr. Coretta had the vow to obey her husband removed from the ceremony, which was unusual for the time. After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: [...] "After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves {{in the middle of}} the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications. I felt blessed to have been called to be a part of such a noble and historic cause." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{want to know}} exactly," [...] she said, [...] "what {{you think}} of it all. I know <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been making fun of it. He does not understand. He never will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she said}} scornfully, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been cruelly imposed upon--imposed upon by some wretched woman, {{who has made}} him {{sacrifice}} his property, his friends, his honor--everything but me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I really couldn't put off being married, could I," [...] Anna protested, [...] "especially when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> {{just got}} the special license. Besides, I {{do not wish to}} return to Vienna just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{she said}} after a little pause, [...] "during {{that time it was}} {{possible}} to come to understandings. Neither I nor <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> understood the other. In that interval it was possible--to explain.|$|E
60|$|My jealousy of Mrs. Beauly, {{smoldering}} in me {{all through}} the interview, burst into flames at those words. I could resist it no longer--I was obliged to ask him if <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> ever loved her.|$|E

5000|$|... "Thanks to you <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> {{neglected}} {{the family}} business and has shown himself completely indifferent to what happens at home. Day and night he spends in visits to the Quarter...Cursed strumpet! Shameless creature!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could earn}} that little sum of money," [...] she {{declared}} gaily, [...] "for <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> {{just made me}} cancel a dinner-party for next Thursday because {{he has to go}} up to the stupid place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{can tell}} you at once," [...] the landlady said, entering. [...] "Your {{daughter}} has recovered, sir, and would come to you, but I begged her to wait until <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> done dressing your wound." ...|$|E
6000|$|I added immeasurably {{to my old}} friend's {{surprise}} by {{not even}} employing the post-office. I wished to see the [...] "instructions" [...] which <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> left behind him. So I took the letter to his lawyers myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Macallan behaved admirably. He {{was still}} helpless. But {{he made an}} excuse for leaving us which it was {{impossible}} to dispute. In two days after <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> spoken to him he was removed from the house.|$|E

6000|$|... "Peace, little Vengeance," [...] said Madame Defarge, laying {{her hand}} with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, [...] "hear me speak. <b>My</b> <b>husband,</b> fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has {{deserved}} well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence.

6000|$|... "Mercy me! You don't say so! Well, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} do with it, you may be sure. He went to London first and then to Paris, and {{in a day or two}} he is to start for Switzerland. His health is very poor and the doctor said he needed the trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know Belllounds? Me? Wal, he's {{the best}} friend I ever had when I was at Kremmlin'. I lived there several years. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> stock there.
