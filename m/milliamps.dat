The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare lesion-detection {{performance}} when interpreting computed tomography (CT) images that are acquired for attenuation correction when performing single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) myocardial perfusion studies. In the United Kingdom, there is a requirement that these images be interpreted; thus, it is necessary to understand observer performance on these images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic chest phantom with inserted spherical lesions of different sizes and contrasts was scanned on five different SPECT/CT systems using site-specific CT protocols for SPECT/CT myocardial perfusion imaging. Twenty-one observers (0 - 4 years of CT experience) searched 26 image slices (17 abnormal, containing 1 - 3 lesions, and 9 normal, containing no lesions) for each CT acquisition. The observers marked and rated perceived lesions under the free-response paradigm. Four analyses were conducted using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis: (1) 20 -pixel acceptance radius (AR) with all 21 readers, abbreviated to 20 /ALL analysis, (2) 40 -pixel AR with 21 readers (40 /ALL), (3) 20 -pixel AR with 14 readers experienced in CT (20 /EXP), and (4) 20 -pixel AR with 7 readers with no CT experience (20 /NOT). The significance level of the test was set so as to conservatively control the overall probability of a type I error to < 0. 05. RESULTS: The mean JAFROC figure of merit (FOM) for the five CT acquisitions for the 20 /ALL study were 0. 602, 0. 639, 0. 372, 0. 475,and 0. 719 with a significant difference in lesion-detection performance evident between all individual treatment pairs (P<. 0001) with the exception of the 1 - 2 pairing, which was not significant (these differed only in <b>milliamp</b> seconds). System 5, which had the highest performance, had the smallest slice thickness and the largest matrix size. For the other analyses, the system orderings remained unchanged, and the significance of FOM difference findings remained identical to those for 20 /ALL, with oneexception: for 20 /EXP analysis the 1 - 2 difference became significant with the higher <b>milliamp</b> seconds superior. Improved detection performance was associated with a smaller slice thickness, increased matrix size, and, to a lesser extent, increased tube charge. CONCLUSIONS: Protocol variations for CT-based attenuation correction (AC) in SPECT/CT imaging have a measurable impact on lesion-detection performance. The results imply that z-axis resolution and matrix size had the greatest impact on lesion detection, with a weaker but detectable dependence on the product of <b>milliamp</b> and seconds...|$|R
50|$|As the ECM {{monitors}} the varying current, a special circuit (also inside the PCM or Power-train Control Module) converts the current into a voltage value and passes {{it on to}} the serial data stream as an OBD-II PID (not to be confused with a PID controller). This is why the best way to test an AFR sensor’s signal is by monitoring the voltage conversion circuitry, which the ECM sends out as an AFR-voltage PID. It is possible to monitor the actual AFR sensor varying current, but the changes are very small (in the low <b>milliamp</b> range) and difficult to monitor. A second drawback to a manual AFR current test is that the signal wire has to be cut or broken to connect the ammeter in series with the pump circuit. Today’s average clamp-on ammeter is not accurate enough at such a small scale. For this reason, the easiest (but not the only) way to test an AFR sensor is with the scanner.|$|R
40|$|Primary Objective: Galvanic {{vestibular}} stimulation (GVS) {{involves the}} delivery of small electrical current to {{the part of the}} scalp that overlies the vestibular nerves. A single, brief session transiently reduces certain types of stroke impairment with no reported side-effects. It is anticipated that further reductions will occur if the duration and frequency of stimulation is increased. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess whether this increased exposure is well-tolerated and consistent with patient well-being. Methods & Procedures: GVS was administered to a stroke sufferer on 5 consecutive days, each for 30 mins at an intensity of 1 <b>milliamp.</b> Tolerability was monitored via a range of behavioural scales sensitive to side-effects experienced during and after stimulation. Results: No unpleasant sensations were reported during stimulation and no deterioration in global function was observed over the 5 day period. Conclusion: The results imply that repeated applications of GVS are tolerable at the parameter settings applied, and provide the basis for larger-scale investigations of safety and efficacy. ...|$|R

40|$|Two new {{concepts}}, NIFTI and DISCOS, are described. These concepts {{enable the}} efficient production of epithermal neutrons for BNCT (Boron Neutron Capture Therapy) medical treatment, utilizing a low current, low energy proton beam impacting on a lithium target. The NIFTI concept uses an iron layer that strongly impedes {{the transmission of}} neutrons with energies above 24 KeV. Lower energy neutrons readily pass through this iron ``filter``, which has a deep ``window`` in its scattering cross section at 24 KeV. The DISCOS concept uses a rapidly rotating, high g disc to create a series of thin ({approximately} 1 micron thickness) liquid lithium targets {{in the form of}} continuous films through which the proton beam passes. The average energy lost by a proton as it passes through a single target is small, approximately 10 KeV. Between the targets, the proton beam is reaccelerated by an applied DC electric field. The DISCOS approach enables the accelerator [...] target facility to operate with a beam energy only slightly above the threshold value for neutron production [...] resulting in an output beam of low-energy epithermal neutrons [...] while achieving a high yield of neutrons per <b>milliamp</b> of proton beam current...|$|R
40|$|Silicon based power devices {{can be used}} at 200 C. The device {{measurements}} {{made during}} this program show a predictable shift in device parameters with increasing temperature. No catastrophic or abrupt changes occurred in the parameters over the temperature range. As expected, the most dramatic change was the increase in leakage currents with increasing temperature. At 200 C the leakage current was in the <b>milliAmp</b> range but was still several orders of magnitude lower than the on-state current capabilities of the devices under test. This increase {{must be considered in}} the design of circuits using power transistors at elevated temperature. Three circuit topologies have been prototyped using MOSFET's and IGBT's. The circuits were designed using zero current or zero voltage switching techniques to eliminate or minimize hard switching of the power transistors. These circuits have functioned properly over the temperature range. One thousand hour life data have been collected for two power supplies with no failures and no significant change in operating efficiency.

50|$|Electricity is hazardous: an {{electric}} shock from a current {{as low as}} 35 <b>milliamps</b> is sufficient to cause fibrillation of the heart in vulnerable individuals. Even a healthy individual is at risk of falling from a high structure due to loss of muscle control. Higher currents can cause respiratory failure and result in extensive and life-threatening burns.

The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is energised, even at high voltages, makes electricity a particular hazard.|$|E
50|$|Power {{capacity}} {{is a function}} of several variables: cathode area, air availability, porosity, and the catalytic value of the cathode surface. Oxygen entry into the cell must be balanced against electrolyte water loss; cathode membranes are coated with (hydrophobic) Teflon material to limit water loss. Low humidity increases water loss; if enough water is lost the cell fails. Button cells have a limited current drain; for example an IEC PR44 cell has a capacity of 600 milliamp-hours (mAh) but a maximum current of only 22 <b>milliamps</b> (mA). Pulse load currents can be much higher since some oxygen remains in the cell between pulses.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} alleged that a {{significant}} cause of current in the ground loop is voltage drop along the equipment protective ground conductors. This is rarely significant, because safety regulations place strict limits on ground leakage current, and ground conductor impedance. For modest sized pieces of equipment such as most audio equipment the ground leakage will be typically less than 2 mA, and the protective ground impedance less than 1 ohm, so this effect will only cause a few <b>milliamps</b> of current to flow in the loop. The current arising due to magnetic induction is liable {{to be at least}} one or two orders of magnitude greater.|$|E
40|$|Presently the Heavy Ion Fusion Virtual National Laboratory is researching ion {{sources and}} {{injector}} concepts {{to understand how}} to optimize beam brightness over a range of currents (50 - 2000 mA argon equivalent). One concept initially accelerates millimeter size, <b>milliamp</b> beamlets to 1 MeV before merging them into centimeter size, ampere beams. Computer simulations have shown the final brightness of the merged beams is dominated by the emittance growth of the merging process, as long as the beamlets ion temperature is below a few eV. Thus, a RF multicusp source capable of high current density can produce beams with better brightness compared to ones extracted from a colder source with a large aperture and lower current density. As such, experiments have begun to develop a RF multicusp source capable of delivering one amp of extracted beam current. It is expected that it will require 10 kW of 13 MHz RF power delivered via a quartz shielded, one and half turn, four inch diameter antenna. Important considerations {{in the development of the}} source include the dependence of current density and beam ion temperature on consumed RF power and gas pressure. A fast rise time ({approx} 100 ns) for the extracted beam pulse must also be achieved. Progress on these experiments will be presented...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{optimize}} the kilovoltage, tube current, and the radiation dose of computed tomographic arthrography of the hip joint using in vitro methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A phantom was prepared using a left femoral head harvested from a patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty and packed in a condom filled with iodinated contrast. The right hip joint of a cadaver was also injected with iodinated contrast. The phantom and the cadaver were scanned using different values of peak kilovoltage (kVp) and tube current (<b>milliamp</b> seconds, mAs). Three different regions of interest (ROI) were drawn in the cartilage, subchondral bone plate, and intraarticular contrast. The attenuation values, contrast/noise ratio (CNR), and effective dose were calculated. Two independent observers classified {{the quality of the}} contrast-cartilage interface and the cartilage-subchondral bone plate interface as (1) diagnostic quality or (2) nondiagnostic quality. RESULTS: Contrast, cartilage, and subchondral bone plate attenuation values decreased at higher kVp. CNR increased with both kVp and mAs. The qualitative analysis showed that in both phantom and cadaver, at 120 kVp and 50 mAs, the contrast-cartilage and cartilage-subchondral bone plate interfaces were of diagnostic quality, with an effective dose decreased to 0. 5 MSv. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute effective dose is not directly related to the quality of images but to the specific combination of kVp and mAs used for image acquisition. The combination of 120 kVp and 50 mAs can be suggested to decrease the dose without adversely affect the visibility of cartilage and subchondral bone plate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
