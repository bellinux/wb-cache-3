50|$|In August 1944 during World War II, all towers were destroyed. A {{temporary}} provisional {{light was}} set in 1945 on a metal <b>Metal</b> <b>pylon,</b> 205 ft tall. This light served until {{the construction of the}} current lighthouse, which was lit on August 25, 1959. The current tower was designed by architects Arbus and Crillon. Three drafts were rejected by the Lighthouse Service, causing a delay in the construction.|$|E
50|$|During {{the week}} of May 22-27, a southwards dip in the jet stream {{occurred}} in the West near Colorado, with favorable thermodynamics advecting northwards and setting {{the potential for a}} tornado outbreak. In the early afternoon of May 22, an Enhanced risk was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for extreme southwestern Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and northern Texas. Numerous tornadoes touched down along the dryline that evening, with the strongest tornadoes touching down in Texas. This included a large, rain-wrapped EF3 tornado that destroyed homes and vehicles near Big Spring. Another EF3 destroyed oil pump jacks near Garden City, while two EF2 tornadoes in the same general area snapped numerous trees and power poles and destroyed, damaged additional pump jacks, and destroyed a mobile home. Less widespread tornado activity occurred on May 23, with mainly scattered weak tornadoes occurring across central and southern Plains. However, a large nighttime wedge tornado caused EF3 damage to <b>metal</b> <b>pylon</b> power poles near Turkey, Texas that night.|$|E
40|$|Mark Pitkin, PhDOne {{lesson from}} {{arthroplasty}} to osseointegration {{in search for}} better fixation of in-bone implanted prosthesis Abstract—Direct transcutaneous prosthetic attachment (osseointegration) consists of implanting directly into the residuum bone a <b>metal</b> <b>pylon</b> whose external fraction connects the residuum to the external prosthesis. Since the introduction of osseointegration about 20 years ago, the obvious challenge associated with this technology has been the skin-pylon interface {{as a source of}} infections. In comparison, the bone-device interface was considered less prob-lematic because of the knowledge and experience inherited from dental implantology and total joint replacement (arthroplasty). Current methods of pylon fixation in osseointegration follow arthroplasty’s paradigm of positioning the pylon’s shaft inside the bone’s medullary canal. However, adopting the medullary canal as a holding compartment for the pylon’s shaft creates the problem of shaft loosening, which has not yet been solved in arthroplasty...|$|E
50|$|Subtransmission lines carry higher {{voltage power}} from {{regional}} substations to local substations. They usually carry 46 kV, 69 kV, or 115 kV for distances up to 60 miles. 230 kV lines are often supported on H-shaped towers made {{with two or}} three poles. Transmission lines carrying voltages of above 230 kV are usually not supported by poles, but by <b>metal</b> <b>pylons</b> (known as transmission towers in the US).|$|R
50|$|There {{were four}} <b>metal</b> {{transmitter}} <b>pylons</b> which were 360 ft high and four wooden receiver pylons which were 240 ft high. The wooden masts were blown {{up in the}} summer of 1957, the metal masts were taken down in late 1957 and early 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The boat must be {{equipped}} with a ski rope and handle. The tow rope must be sufficiently long for maneuvering, with a recommended length of 75 ft (within tolerance) although length varies widely {{depending on the type}} of water skiing and the skier's skill level. Competition requirements on rope construction have changed over the years, from [...] "quarter-inch polypropylene rope" [...] in 1992 to the 2003 flexibility as long as the same specification is used [...] "for the entire event." [...] The rope and handle are anchored to the boat and played out at the stern. This anchor point on a recreation boat is commonly a tow ring or cleat, mounted on the boat's stern. For more dedicated skiers, a <b>metal</b> ski <b>pylon</b> is placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier. This pylon is mounted securely, since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension in the ski rope and the pylon.|$|R
50|$|A violent EF4 wedge tornado {{produced}} catastrophic damage as it impacted {{the outskirts}} of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province, China {{on the afternoon of}} June 23. Thousands of masonry construction homes were destroyed, many of which were leveled. Trees were debarked, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and <b>metal</b> power line <b>pylons</b> and truss towers were bent to the ground. Schools and manufacturing plants sustained major damage as well. 99 people were killed and 846 others were injured, many of them critically. The tornado traveled approximately 33 km from Banhuzhen to Wutanzhen, with a maximum width of about 4.5 km.|$|R
50|$|The large, {{wedge-shaped}} tornado {{carved a}} wide path of destruction through Funing and Sheyang counties in Jiangsu province, leaving behind catastrophic damage as it impacted {{the outskirts of}} Yancheng. Wind speeds of up to 125 km/h were measured {{at the edge of}} the city. Thousands of masonry-construction homes were damaged or destroyed, with many completely leveled. Manufacturing plants, businesses, and rice mills suffered from similar destruction, and multiple large factory buildings were severely damaged at a Canadian Solar plant. A large school building sustained major structural damage as well. Many vehicles were tossed and destroyed; trees were completely denuded and debarked; and numerous <b>metal</b> power line <b>pylons</b> and truss towers were bent and crumpled to the ground. First responders reported bodies strewn across devastated communities.|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{essentially}} followed the Chef Menteur Highway as it continued eastward, significantly damaging homes and other structures at EF2 strength along this {{segment of the}} path. A small strip mall and a church sustained major roof damage and had every window blown out, a gas station was heavily damaged and had its service station canopy shredded, homes had their roofs completely removed, and many concrete light poles were snapped. A final segment of low-end EF3 damage occurred further east as several large <b>metal</b> power <b>pylons</b> along the highway were bent in half. High-end EF2 damage occurred in neighborhoods {{just north of the}} highway, as numerous homes sustained significant roof and exterior wall loss. Past Bullard Avenue, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and the damage path shifted southward. Numerous small trees were snapped near the Interstate 510 and Almonaster Avenue interchange. The tornado then restrengthened to EF2 intensity as it caused heavy damage to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility. Windows were blown out, and large metal industrial buildings sustained major structural damage. The large, two-story office building that houses the National Finance Center suffered significant roof damage and collapse of both the brick facade and cinder block exterior walls in a few places. Vehicles in the National Finance Center parking lot were severely damaged. The tornado then continued eastward across unpopulated marshy areas before dissipating over Lake Borgne.|$|R
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on January21, a large tornado touched down {{northwest}} of Purvis in Lamar County, Mississippi, at 3:35a.m. EST (08:35UTC). The tornado initially caused EF1 damage, snapping and uprooting many trees and destroying small sheds. A house sustained minor roof damage and collapse of its carport, and a power pole was snapped as well. Further to the northeast, the tornado reached EF2 intensity as it ripped the roof off of a well-built brick home and destroyed outbuildings. As the tornado approached the Forrest County line, EF2 damage continued as another home had its roof torn off, a mobile home was completely destroyed, and a billboard pole was snapped. Other homes in this area sustained minor roof damage, and trees and power poles were downed. The tornado intensified to EF3 strength shortly after it crossed the Forrest County line and entered residential areas of southwestern Hattiesburg, where multiple well-constructed brick homes had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed, and an elderly woman was killed. The tornado continued producing EF3 damage as it crossed Veterans Memorial Drive, snapping <b>metal</b> power <b>pylons</b> and severely damaging two buildings at Living Word Church. Maintaining its strength, the tornado moved across U.S. Route 49 and through a residential area, damaging several homes and destroying the top floor of a church. The tornado then tore directly through the William Carey University campus, resulting in severe structural damage and tossing and damaging numerous vehicles in the parking lots. Multiple large, multi-story brick buildings had windows blown out, roofs ripped off, and top floor exterior walls collapsed. Light poles were downed at the ball field as well.|$|R
