40|$|Abstract. The paper {{contains}} {{results of}} a comprehensive research and development programme aimed at an evaluation of static strength of a GRP railway bogie of a new advanced design. The works were carried out {{as one of the}} essential phases of the implementation of a EUREKA project EUROBOGIE, which is aimed at development of advanced vehicle bogies and has a great potential to lead to more efficient movement of freight and passengers with lower environmental impact. The GRP bogie design consists of three main load carrying parts, namely two quite massive longitudinal side frames connected by a central transom plate which are manufactured in a single <b>moulding</b> <b>operation</b> using the resin transfer moulding (RTM) method. Since the component is unusually thick, all parameters of the RTM method have to be well balanced. One of the critical issues in the design and manufacture is the connection area of the transom with the side frames. Therefore, testing of this subcomponent was {{an important part of the}} bogie development.

The <b>moulding</b> <b>operation</b> is performed by means of semi-permanent mould casting and also by means of lost foam casting. The foundry produced 12400 t of wastes in year 2002, made of the following materials: several types of muds and dusts coming from dust abatement plants (28. 7 %), furnace and ladle slags (21 %), aluminium shavings (21 %), machinery emulsions (9. 8 %), exhaust moulds and cores (4. 7 %), various materials packing (4 %), refractory material from furnaces (3. 5 %), saline solutions containing phosphates (3. 5 %), wastewater treatment mud (1. 6 %) and other materials (1. 7 %).

40|$|The {{effect of}} plasma {{treatment}} on the adhesion {{strength of a}} moulding compound to a leadframe is evaluated {{on the basis of}} leadframe pull-out tests. The contact angle measurement method and atomic force microscopy are employed to quantitatively characterise the modified surface so as to correlate with the bond strength measurements. Process parameters including the type of gases used and the duration exposed in air before moulding are specifically studied. The results indicate that plasma treatments of leadframe have three major ameliorating effects, namely, clean surface due to the removal of organic contaminants, enhanced chemical compatibility with moulding compound and rough surface with associated larger surface contact area for better mechanical interlocking. Exposure of plasma treated leadframes in air before moulding is found detrimental to interface bond quality, recommending <b>moulding</b> <b>operations</b> immediately after treatment.

A discrete-event flow simulation model of a typical dimension mill with planing, ripping, chopping, and <b>moulding</b> <b>operations</b> under rip-first conditions was developed, and the flow of material through the system was studied. Representations of wood component requirements were generated through Monte Carlo simulation from random uniform distributions of twenty different component possibilities and served to fulfill randomly generated cutting bills, each consisting of five different orders, with a new order generated and added to the cutting bill as a current order was fulfilled. Statistical analysis of results obtained under various conditions of production and demand was conducted. Increased variability of cutting bills was found to significantly reduce order cycle times, reduce in-process inventories, and increase the total orders completed.

40|$|The use of {{composites}} {{for structural}} {{applications in the}} automotive industry has become more attractive due to the possible weight savings and part integration. Liquid moulding processes, where the reinforcement is prepared separately from the <b>moulding</b> <b>operation,</b> have been suggested as a suitable production method. However there are several obstacles to overcome before they can meet the high production volumes required. Whilst forming the preform, defects such as wrinkling and tearing can occur which can prevent successful moulding. This thesis addresses problems {{in the design and}} production of preforms. Current preform manufacturing processes and modelling techniques are reviewed. A model based on kinematic principles to predict fibre architectures for biaxial fabrics draped over arbitrary surfaces is described. A technique based on grid strain analysis was used to measure the deformation of various stitch bonded fabrics, and compared to the kinematic drape model results. The pure shear assumptions of the kinematic drape model assume the fabric has zero resistance to shear. Experimental measurements of fabric in-plane shear resistance were undertaken and compared for a range of fabrics. This highlighted some important criteria in fabric selection and possible problems in the kinematic modelling approach. The results from the in-plane shear tests were compared with those from the grid strain analysis to determine which fabric variables were important to fabric formability. Problems in the application of constraints within the kinematic model were discovered, and methods for overcoming them were suggested. Criteria which must be considered when selecting suitable fabrics for high drape preforms are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of micromoulding blocks {{for the mass}} {{production of}} plastic microparts is associated to {{the decision of the}} more adequate micromanufacturing technology for the quickest time to <b>moulding</b> <b>operation.</b> The integration of subtractive and additive micro manufacturing technologies and micromoulding techniques made the development of plastics microcomponents in several domains of activity possible at feasible costs. However, the lifetime expectancy of their replication tools is directly dependent on the tool material properties and the thermal and mechanical characteristics of moulding process. Besides the tool manufacturing costs, post-treatments to achieve the enhancement of tool properties as surface roughness or abrasion resistance must also be considered, so that the mass production process results technically and economically effective. Thus, a trade-off is required to establish the break-even point between the overall tool cost and the tool lifetime. An analysis was made on the design of plastics microparts considering their performance requirements and implications on the tooling manufacturing route and expected production life. It was considered the use of additive and subtractive technologies for the microtooling manufacture using current industrial equipment. This study enabled a possible approach using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) towards the detailed analysis of the life cycle and production costs of common routes in microinjection moulding. A study of this type requires the continuous update of micromanufacturing technological developments in order to score actual process features.

40|$|Thermal spray tooling {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{technologies}} which have been developed to satisfy the need for low cost tooling, which is used when prototype components are required in the correct engineering material. In its current state, the technology has a number of fundamental shortcomings. The aim of this portfolio was to address these shortcomings, via a combination of experimental work and technology demonstrators - these are summarised as follows: • An experimental programme aimed to quantify many of the problems associated with thermal spray tooling. A wide variety of tests on thermal spray surfaces was carried out, in order to compare their performance with other 'low cost' tooling techniques. For the first time, tooling shells were produced using the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) technique. This system is capable of producing extremely high quality tool shells, and the technique developed involves the novel use of castable ceramic patterns - the first time a releasable pattern has been developed for this spray system. In addition, it was established that 'hybrid' tooling shells could be produced - these were formed using a combination of arc spray and HVOF layers. The work proved that these hybrid shells could provide substantial performance benefits in terms of wear performance and vacuum integrity, when compared to conventional arc sprayed shells - this benefit was also achieved without significant cost penalty. The programme also investigated the effect of thermal cycling on thermal spray samples - it was shown that repeated cycling at high temperature had an adverse effect on both arc sprayed and HVOF samples - the extent of this effect was very much dependent on the material. • The portfolio includes a technology demonstrator programme, which was carried out for Rover Group to show the potential of thermal spray tooling. The programme entailed the manufacture of a suite of 5 tools for compression moulding of Glass Mat Thermoplastic(GMT). The actual route used for the production of the tooling suite involved many unique features, which had not previously been utilised for thermal spray tooling production. One of the tools is the largest ever produced for compression moulding using thermal spraying, being approximately 4 m 2, and weighing in excess of 3 tonnes. Due to the compressive stresses involved in the moulding process, conventional resin backing systems were unsuitable for this tooling. It was therefore necessary to use a Chemically Bonded Ceramic (CBC) material, with an exceptionally high compressive strength. However, this material does not adhere to thermal spray surfaces, and it was therefore important to develop a novel fixing method at the interface of the materials. Further to this, in certain cases the use of thermal spraying was precluded by the component geometry - in these cases it was necessary to use the CBC material as the direct tool face. This was the first time that CBC tooling had been used for compression moulding GMT, and it was therefore necessary to develop new post-treatments for this inherently porous material. The <b>moulding</b> <b>operation</b> then entailed the development of specific techniques and conditions for this prototype tooling, which would not generally be used in production - normal moulding conditions for 'production' tooling were therefore inappropriate. Further work will entail materials development, the introduction of automation and development of design rules, specifically aimed at the production of large tooling for the aerospace and automotive sectors - this will be carried out via a successful project submission under the Innovative Manufacturing Initiative (lMl) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} titanium and titanium alloys castings is a difficult and expensive task. The main reasons for that are: the high melting point; the extremely high reactivity of titanium alloys against {{a large amount of}} elements (solid, liquids and gaseous) at high temperatures, with particular emphasis to oxygen. For this reason, traditional casting techniques and materials cannot be used, both for the melting and the <b>moulding</b> <b>operations,</b> and melting and pouring have to be performed under vacuum or inert gas. However, such demands are extremely important factors to the high cost of titanium castings, and one possible way to decrease it might be the use of traditional casting techniques, with slight changes both on materials and production equipments and procedures. This paper describes the production technique of TiAl castings, using a multi-layered refractory crucible based on stabilized zirconia, and pouring in different refractory investment casting shells.

The improvements due to the addition of the fine particles to the usually employed clay for tile production were also underlined from the results of several baking tests. The recovery and recycling of sands and fine particles obtained from the reclamation of bentonite moulding sands will lead to a saving of raw materials and landfill space, with economic and environmental advantage...|$|R
40|$|All The {{traditional}} foundry {{usually not}} only uses batch melting where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, but also uses the gravity filling method in both Sand Casting Process (SCP) and Investment Casting Process (ICP). In the gravity filling operation, the turbulent behaviour of the liquid metal causes substantial entrainment of the surface oxide films which are subsequently trapped into the liquid and generate micro cracks and casting defects. In this paper a new CRIMSON process is introduced which features instead of gravity filling method, using the single shot up-casting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid filling <b>mould</b> <b>operations</b> which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation. Another advantage of the new process is the drastic reduction of energy consumption due to shortened melting and filling time.

The main fractions are core and moulding sands, muds and powders from dust abatement plants, furnace and ladle slags, and exhaust lime, making about 750 - 800 t/d of residues for a production of about 800 t/d of globular and grey cast iron. All wastes were sampled and characterized by means of particle-size distribution and chemical analyses to evaluate the best reuse and recycling solutions. On the grounds of the gathered results, the residues may be divided in three categories according to the particle-size dimensions: below 0. 1 mm, between 0. 1 and 0. 6 mm and above 0. 6 mm. The fraction above 0. 6 mm, mainly made of metallic iron, may be reused in the furnaces. The fraction between 0. 1 mm and 0. 6 mm may be reused in cores production, after a regeneration treatment.

The effects on steel cleanliness of specific operational improvements during steel refining and continuous casting have been investigated. Such improvements to these processes and the resulting level of steel cleanliness at Baosteel are summarised in the present paper. Ladle slag reduction lowers FeOzMnO in the slag to below 5 %, decreasing steel reoxidation by the slag. Calcium treatment by CaSi wire injection during ladle furnace (LF) refining is used to modify inclusions and improve submerged entry nozzle (SEN) clogging. Slag detection is employed at the ladle bottom during continuous casting.

40|$|The {{conventional}} foundry {{not only}} frequently uses batch melting, where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, sometimes {{as long as a}} complete shift, but also uses the gravity sand casting process where the molten aluminium alloys are transferred using a ladle from furnace to pour station and are poured into a mould. During the filling of the mould, the turbulent nature of the liquid metal gives rise to massive entrainment of the surface oxide films which are the subsequently trapped into the liquid and act as micro cracks. Also the long exposure time of the liquid surface to the surrounding environment during melting, transferring and filling will increase the level of hydrogen absorption from the atmosphere. The abovementioned factors are often the main reasons for casting defect generation. In this paper the novel CRIMSON aluminium casting method is introduced which has a number of advantages. Instead of gravity filling method, it uses the single shot upcasting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid counter-gravity-filling <b>mould</b> <b>operations</b> which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Planing and <b>moulding</b> <b>operations</b> carried out within the woodworking industry make an extensive use of rotary machining. Cuttermarks are produced on the timber surface, which are generally accepted as unavoidable. More noticeable surface defects may be produced by such factors as cutterhead imbalance, and until recently most research has concentrated on removing these defects. When a high quality finish is required, a further machining operation, such as sanding, is often required to remove cuttermarks. What is required is a modified machining process, which combines a surface closer to the ideal fixed knife finish, while retaining the flexibility, practicality and cost effectiveness of rotary machining. It has been theorized that the surface finish of planed and moulded timber products may be improved by introducing vertical cutterhead pulses. This thesis concerns the progress made towards the modification of the rotary machining process to improve surface form for planed timber components. Thus simulation of the rotary machining process is described, allowing {{an evaluation of the}} surface form quality produced by the modified machining process, and allowing a comparison to be made between the effectiveness of new machining process and conventional rotary machining. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed machining method, a small-scale planer with an actuation system using piezoelectric actuators to control the spindle movement was designed. An electrical model of the piezoelectric actuators was combined with a finite element model of the spindle to create an overall model used for simulation. The modelling technique used represents significant progress in the field of mechatronic system modelling, and a useful tool for designing active spindle systems...|$|R

The chemical modifications, {{caused by the}} <b>moulding</b> and cleaning <b>operations</b> and due to carbonation, are efficiently investigated. Based on the detection of specific elements (such as chlorine, carbon and silicon), the presence of formworks residues is established on the concrete surface. Similarly, aliphatic (C-(C,H) and carbonaceous (C-O) residues of the demoulding agent can be detected. The concentration gradients show the presence of moulding residues is mainly superficial and decreases rapidly according to the depth. However, certain of these contaminants (and especially polydimethylsiloxane residues) could alter the wetting of aqueous-based coatings. The sandblasting process can partially remove the moulding residues, but the decontamination remains incomplete {{in spite of the}} high increase of the roughness of the samples. On the contrary, the concentrations in aliphatic and carbonaceous residues increase after cleaning with solvents, which can be trapped in the pores of concrete to contaminate the surface. The carbonation process is also investigated by XPS.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rotary planing and <b>moulding</b> machining <b>operations</b> {{have been widely used}} within the woodworking industry for many years. As a result of these machining processes, the surface proftle of machined timber consists of cuttermarks which determine the product quality. However, the presence of machine system variations does not guarantee the quality requirements. Most of the rotary machining improvement techniques applied to obtain an improved product quality focus on conventional methods such as tooling and spindle system design. Tbe current state of the industry indicates that the design of rotary planing machines has probably reached its mechanical development limit, hence for an advanced machining process, mechatronics based improvement techniques are necessary. Therefore, the focus of this research work is directed towards the improvements on a mechatronics based small scale wood planer. Firstly, the effects of machining variations on the resultant surface form have been investigated. Especially, the effects of spindle vibrations and tooling inaccuracies on the surface ftnish have been analysed through simulation and further demonstrated through experimental work. With the introduced defect generation tool (DGT), the effect of a speciftc disturbance could be made to order, hence allowing generation of defects for quality investigations. This is not possible on existing machinery. Secondly, for an enhanced machining environment, surface proftle information is desirable. Various surface proftle measurement systems have been evaluated in terms of in-process deployment. Most of the evaluated measurement systems lack the measurement speed or exhibit other disadvantages which limit their implementation for real-time measurement purposes. Therefore, a novel in-process surface prof:tle monitoring system (ISMS) has been introduced that is capable of extracting surface proftle features in real-time. Thirdly, active vibration control has been implemented on the small scale planer. Unlike conventional design improvement methods, with the active vibration control approach the dynamic characteristics of the small scale planer were substantially improved, hence enabling a higher degree of freedom in terms of machining operation. This improvement allows machining operations beyond the limitations set by the mechanical properties of the planing system, thus enabling higher product quality where additional machining processes such as sanding could be obsolete...|$|R
40|$|The {{amendment}} modifies the Seabrook Technical Specifications (TS) {{to permit}} {{operation of the}} Seabrook core with an expanded axial flux difference band (wide-band operation) from that currently permitted. Other TS changes allow for fuel design enhancements. Wide-band operation is based on information derived from the fixed in-core detector system (FIDS). The use of FIDS to satisfy TS requirements was approved by Amendment 27 issued on December 22, 1993. The core design enhancements are based on methodologies described in YAEC- 1849 P, YAEC- 1854 P, and YAEC- 1856 P which were approved previously for use at Seabrook. North Atlantic supported the proposed technical specification changes with reanalyses of the UFSAR Chapter 15 accidents and transients, documented in YAEC- 1871, and a Westinghouse Electric Corporation loss-of-coolant-accident reanalysis. These supporting documents and a revised Core Operating Limits Report were submitted with the application for amendment. North Atlantic proposed certain changes to TS 3. 1. 1. 3 that <b>mould</b> have permitted <b>operation</b> with a positive moderator temperature coefficient. The Commission has not yet determined if this change is acceptable. We have discussed with your staff additional information that North Atlantic must provide for us to continue with our review of this issue. Therefore, the proposed change to TS 3. 1. 1. 3 is not being approved at this time. Additionally, North Atlantic will need to modify TS 6. 8. 1. 6, regarding the COLR prior to entering Cycle 5 to reflect {{the results of these}} evaluations and the new methodologies used to develop the COLR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The market’s {{demand to}} {{purchase}} more cost effective products is continuously increasing. The producers {{are forced to}} become more efficient and flexible with resources to produce high quality products at a low cost {{in order to maintain}} or increase market shares. With this in mind Isaberg Rapid AB is requesting a project to increase efficiency in the assembly cell of hammertackers. The company has found in Kaizen-events that there is a potential of efficiency improvements in the assembly group that has not been achieved. The objective with this paper is to identify the major factors that influence the efficiency in the assembly cell for hammertackers. At the same time the project is to generate data on new operation times, calculate the number of operators required in the cell and to implement standardized work instructions. The facts and data have been collected by discussions with operators, time studies and by filming the operation. A one week Kaizen-event with the operators was made, where the selected changes were implemented. The result of the changes in terms of efficiency and output were registered. The following basic questions are answered in the report. What changes are required to increase efficiency? What are the non-conformity reasons that prevent the group from reaching the production targets? Is there a need for a different set up in the cell? In the Kaizen-event, a number of observations were made in the hammertacker group and the major wastes were identified. The largest wastes were identified to be that materials for packing were too far from the assembly cell, setting times for tool changes were long and that the operators’ workload was not in balance.  A new layout was made to reduce the distance to packing materials. The height and setting of moulds were changed to get faster <b>mould</b> exchange. <b>Operations</b> were  introduced to the cell to get a better balance of the workload between operators. The observed interruptions have mainly been due to lack of different raw materials. There was no reason to modify the way work was carried out in the cell; never the less, some minor adjustments were made. The change with the biggest impact was to remind the operators of the factors that affect the productivity most. The number of produced products has increased by 21 %, which also gives the corresponding efficiency increase. The conclusion of this paper is that increased productivity is obtained by identifying and eliminating waste, increasing the participation of the operators and creating a standardized way of working...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{technology}} for obtaining bricks {{on the basis}} of lime-silica mixtures where chemical interactions are practically completely realized in dispersive state at the stage of preparation of binding contact maturing and raw mixture as a whole. The role of forming <b>operation</b> (<b>moulding)</b> is changed in principle because in this case conversion of dispersive system into a rock-like solid occurs and due to this the solid obtains complete water-resistance in contact with water immediately after forming operation. Theoretical basis for the developed technology is capability of silicate dispersive substances (hydrated calcium silicate) to transit in non-stable state, to form a rock-like water-resistant solid in the moment of mechanical load application during forming process. Specific feature of the proposed method is an exclusion of additional operations for autoclaving of products from the process of obtaining a silicate brick. Synthetic hydrated calcium silicate in contrast to natural ones are more uniform in composition and structure, they contain less impurities and they are characterized by dispersive composition and due to the mentioned advantages they find wider practical application. Contact-condensation binders permit to manipulate product properties on their basis and ensure maximum correspondence to the requirements of the concrete application. Raw material sources for obtaining synthetic hydrated calcium silicates are practically un-limited because calcium-silicon containing substances are found as in various technogenic wastes so in natural compounds as well. So the problem for obtaining hydrated calcium silicates having contact-condensation ability for structure formation becomes more and more actual one. This transition is considered as dependent principally on arrangement rate of substance particles which determined the level of its instability. </p...|$|R
