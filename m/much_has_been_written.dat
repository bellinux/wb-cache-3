When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

Varied meanings were offered by academes and practitioners and are still adopted by private and government agencies and became the guiding principles of business and social entrepreneurship. Blundel and Lockett (2011) claimed that entrepreneurship is a phenomenon associated with entrepreneurial activity and involves a complex pattern of social interactions that extends beyond individual entrepreneurs to incorporate teams, organizations, networks and institutions. For Carter and Evans (2012), {{it is also a}} capacity, but for innovation, investment and expansion in new markets, products and techniques. Entrepreneurs therefore, involves the relationship of entrepreneurial opportunities and enterprising individuals, and the ability to identify opportunities as {{a key part of the}} entrepreneurial process.|$|R

40|$|My {{contention}} {{within this}} thesis {{is that there}} is an absence of literature on working class girls within both the gender and education and social class and education literature. I draw on issues related to girls and education and on more recent issues on boys and education, to deternnine what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> said about working class girls. It became apparent that there <b>was</b> very little <b>written</b> on working class girls within the body of literature. Then I chose to explore social class and education to find out if working class girls are discussed. It was also found that not <b>much</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> on working class girls in social class and education literature. In my final chapter I suggest ways to address the absence of working class girls by recommending some questions that can be addressed In future research, so that a real understanding of what is happening with working class girls within the education system can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of higher}} {{education}} and universities in societal development are characteristically very dynamic. In the context of urban development, there are voluminous materials {{on the role of}} universities (western model) in the development of urban areas. But not <b>much</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> on the role of Islamic-based universities in the era of globalization and internationalization. Arguably, based on the western model, and in the context of Malaysia, higher education institutions in particular universities, functioned to produce employable graduates. But {{in the context of the}} developing countries, universities have a developmental role too, in particular, the development of areas in which they are located. This can be beyond employment consideration. Using Kuala Lumpur city-region as a case study, this paper examines the role of Islamic-based universities in urban development in comparison with universities which are based on the western model. The findings should contribute in some ways to formulating an explanatory framework to investigate the role of Islamic-based universities in urban development...|$|R

25|$|Information {{about the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of synephrine used as a single drug may be deduced from the foregoing {{review of the literature}} in this Article. This information is, by and large, not contended.

Since this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically-active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine, further discussion is outside the scope of this article.|$|E

25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> {{in books}} about the first two of the {{preceding}} branches of the Forcade family. These genealogical texts typically focus directly or indirectly on proving their lineage from a family member in Orthez, either by drawing upon letters patent that were issued, the opinions issued by royal genealogists or from the decisions and judgments of judicial entities. Much less {{has been written about}} the third of the preceding branches, or about the Forcades of Orthez themselves. Whereas the first two branches were required at various times throughout history to prove their lineage from the family in Orthez, many generations or several hundred years earlier, the third branch and the core of the family, who are essentially one and the same, had little difficulty proving their lineage. During the 17th century, the third branch and the core of the family were still geographically situated in or near Orthez and Pau.|$|E

Nonetheless, this article revisits him mainly because {{the challenges that}} the Islamic world faced and which he tried, in vain, to address during his turbulent time remain basically the same in our chaotic time, even in a much acute form after the historic September 11, 2001 incident. Chief among those are the devastating Shi'i-Sunni conflict and the accelerating Western cultural and physical invasion of the Muslim world The article attempts to give a fresh interpretation and assessment of Afghāni’s complex character, stormy life and religo-political legacy. The study also poses a presumably interesting question, namely, why Afghāni’s visionary thought was not acclaimed during his life, and may it be recalled now to address the stubborn problem that the Muslims are currently facing, particularly the Muslim-Muslim confrontation in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and the general disarray of the Ummah...|$|R
