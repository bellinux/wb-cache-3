25|$|Spanish wine laws {{created the}} Denominación de Origen (DO) system in 1932 and were later revised in 1970. The system shares many {{similarities}} with the hierarchical Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system of France, Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) and Italy's Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) system. As of 2009, there were 79 Quality Wine areas across Spain. In addition there is Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa or DOQ in Catalan) status for DOs {{that have a}} consistent track record for quality. There are currently two DOCa/DOQ regions: Rioja and Priorat. Each DO has a Consejo Regulador, which acts as a governing control body that enforces the DO regulations and standards involving viticultural and winemaking practices. These regulations govern everything from the types of grapes that are permitted to be planted, the maximum yields that can be harvested, the <b>minimum</b> <b>length</b> of time that the wine must be aged and what type of information is required {{to appear on the}} wine label. Wineries that are seeking to have their wine sold under DO or DOC status must submit their wines to the Consejo Regulador laboratory and tasting panel for testing and evaluation.

The {{technics}} {{for predicting}} thermal cycle of a quenching {{by using the}} finite element method have been studied by comparing theoretical values with numerical analysis results. The basic equation of a <b>minimum</b> element <b>length</b> for cylinder thermal cycle was proposed, which was able to calculate from informations such as an initial temperature, a radius of cylinder, a heat transfer coefficient and the aimed temperature change at the cylinder surface. The minimum time increment for guaranteeing accuracy was given corresponding to the <b>minimum</b> element <b>length.</b> It was shown that the <b>minimum</b> element <b>length</b> for pipe thermal cycle was replaced by that of cylinder. Temperature distribution in cylinder during quenching process can be sufficiently predicted by the finite element method with the above, mentioned <b>minimum</b> element <b>length</b> and the <b>minimum</b> time increment...|$|R

Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row.

40|$|We analyze {{differences}} between two information-theoretically motivated approaches to statistical inference and model selection: the <b>Minimum</b> Description <b>Length</b> (MDL) principle, and the <b>Minimum</b> Message <b>Length</b> (MML) principle.
