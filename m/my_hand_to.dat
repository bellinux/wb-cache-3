5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E

2500|$|A {{new level}} of gravity came to the {{controversy}} when responding to [...] "a flood of e-mails from constituents" [...] about Ellison's oath, fifth term Representative Virgil H. Goode, Jr. (R–VA) issued a letter on the matter. Goode wrote [...] "When I raise <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand.

2500|$|But I, though I saw {{and heard}} these things, refused {{to write for}} a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the {{diversity}} of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [...] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!' ...|$|E

I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cope {{describes}} Mrs. Phillips' dinner, {{the fine}} {{house and its}} appointments. He thought Randolph was especially attentive to him at dinner and that Joe found him boisterous: [...] "He must have fancied me (from the racket I was making) {{as a sort of}} free-and-easy Hercules..., if not as the whole football squad rolled into one." [...] Cope tried not to shake Joe's hand too vigorously, but Joe [...] "took all I gave and even seemed to hang on for a little more."(63) He notices Joe indicate by glances to Mrs. Phillips that he is disappointed Cope does not sing on this occasion. Randolph walks Cope home and then ends the evening, in Cope's words, [...] "taking <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> say good night and taking his own time in dropping it."(66) In a letter, Cope urges his friend Arthur Lemoyne to leave Winnebago and come to live with him: [...] "...we can go into quarters together: a real bed instead of an upholstered shelf and a closet big enough for two wardrobes."(67) Randolph visits Cope in his modest rooms and Cope finds him not at all judgmental. Cope returns the visit and they discuss the authors of Shakespeare's plays. Randolph takes Cope to dinner and the theater. When Cope declines alcohol, Randolph feels [...] "like a corrupter of youth,"(74) but he is pleased that Cope treats him as a peer and never calls him [...] "sir." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edna Dean Proctor {{wrote an}} ode for the event, and [...] "There {{was also an}} oration {{suitable}} for declamation." [...] Bellamy held that [...] "Of course, the nub {{of the program was}} to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison." [...] He found [...] "There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, [...] "I give my heart and <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> my country, one country, one language, one flag," [...] seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity." [...] After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, [...] "It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word 'allegiance'. ...Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that 'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first person singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to 'the.'" [...] Bellamy considered the words [...] "country, nation, or Republic," [...] choosing the last as [...] "it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands." [...] Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded [...] "all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] then I said I would pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, and keep Your covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At all events,' said Joe, 'he can't {{pick and}} choose his means of earning a livelihood, as another man may.
