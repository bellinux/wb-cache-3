500|$|Bannon was 22years {{old when}} she began writing her first pulp novel. She was {{influenced}} by the only lesbian novels she had read, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall from 1928 and Vin Packer's Spring Fire from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel, but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of Spring Fire. Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them. In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said, [...] "I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time down on paper." ...|$|E
500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E

2500|$|I have {{concerned}} {{myself with}} him since autumn 1998. Not, {{as has been}} claimed, to get him doping products. Everybody knows perfectly, starting with the policemen who have listened to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, that riders don't need me {{for that sort of}} thing. To the contrary. If they turn to me, it's because they've heard of what I {{have been able to do}} [...] for the great stars I have cited.|$|E
2500|$|Lata {{considered}} Asha's act of eloping {{with her}} lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone {{to sing and}} earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Asha herself stated in an interview– [...] "It was a love marriage and Lata didi did not speak to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. She disapproved of the alliance." [...] At one time, their relationship was very adversarial {{and there have been}} periods of non-communication.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy {{to take advantage of this}} weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{and then took}} another swig from his bottle.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> moment, {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mrs. Peyton," [...] {{broke in}} Clarence, impulsively, [...] "you have a horse--I saw it, a lovely lady's horse--eating its head {{off in the}} stable. Won't you let me run back and order it; and won't you, please, come out with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good, <b>long</b> gallop?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{his views}} on this subject {{were not to be}} shared with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> many <b>a</b> <b>long</b> day. Our half-hour was over; and there stood Mrs Monnerie, mushroom-shaped, it is true, but {{suggesting}} nothing of the evanescent, as she looked in on us from the mahogany doorway.|$|R

60|$|He took <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk {{to break}} it to me, over the hills towards Yare and across the great gorse commons by Hazelbrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{something}} on my mind," [...] said Mr. Heard, with a diabolical {{glance at the}} mate--"something wot's been worrying <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I've been deceiving you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Discussing {{the sound}} of the track, she said: [...] "This is my country one, but there's also a bit of reggae in there too.

6000|$|... 'Oh! very well, {{poor old}} man, on the whole, though it made one pity him doubly that {{he chose to}} make as if he forgot everything, and you were all gone on a picnic, taking <b>me</b> out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> drive in the afternoon--where we were least likely to meet any one--that I will say for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can't {{get out of}} me what is not in me. You can't wrest from me what I {{have not}} got. Mine is but a poor calling. You have had more than two guineas from me, already.

6000|$|... 'And as you've known <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, you know,' said Mr Toots, 'let me {{assure you}} that {{she is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} women that ever lived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{repeated}} softly, [...] "I don't understand myself. You've known <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, Andrew. You wouldn't write me down as altogether a sentimental ass, would you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The old {{man looked}} at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before he spoke. There was a puzzled {{expression}} upon his wrinkled face, and a look of hurt sorrow in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Talleyrand and <b>me</b> hadn't met <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time {{except at}} emigre parties. When I {{give him the}} message he just shook his head. He was sorting buttons in the shop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sayest thou so--sayest thou so, Kallikrates? Nay, but thou hast {{not seen}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> so <b>long</b> <b>a</b> time that no memory remains. Yet am I very fair, Kallikrates!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} them and they looked at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, since {{following}} my usual rule, I determined {{not to be the}} first to speak. Moreover, if they meant to kill me there was no use in speaking. At length their leader, an elderly man with thin legs, a large stomach and a rather pleasant countenance, saluted politely, saying-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, evil beast," [...] {{said the}} woman, with a chuckle, [...] "you won't bite me any more; you'll {{forget all about}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Look at him, Ibubesi, look at him." ...|$|E

60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body.

I took her into my arms--she clung to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment--one <b>long,</b> delicious moment.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Poulsen {{has also}} {{revealed}} {{several of the}} guest musicians on the album stating [...] "I’m very very proud to have these fine gentlemen with me, since they inspired <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." ...|$|R
