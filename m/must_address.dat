25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also <b>must</b> <b>address</b> and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships {{that may not have}} been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, <b>must</b> <b>address</b> preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E

25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor <b>must</b> <b>address</b> these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} of non-opiate substances relative to the diamorphine content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel <b>must</b> <b>address</b> the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either {{the completion of the}} toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The acetaminophen content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of acetaminophen are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not know how much acetaminophen is in any given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.|$|E

She was Stanley Ann Dunham at birth and Stanley Ann as a child, but dropped the Stanley upon graduating from high school. She was Ann Dunham, then Ann Obama, then Ann Soetoro until her second divorce. Then she kept her husband's name but modernized the spelling to Sutoro. In the early 1980s, she was Ann Sutoro, Ann Dunham Sutoro, S. Ann Dunham Sutoro. In conversation, Indonesians who worked with her in the late 1980s and early 1990s referred to her as Ann Dunham, putting the emphasis on the second syllable of the surname. Toward the end of her life, she signed her dissertation S. Ann Dunham and official correspondence (Stanley) Ann Dunham.:modernized the spelling: The spelling of certain Indonesian words changed after Indonesia gained its independence from the Dutch in 1949, and again under a 1972 agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia... Names containing oe,... are now often spelled with a u... However, older spellings are still used in some personal names... After her divorce from Lolo Soetoro, Ann Dunham kept his last name {{for a number of years}} while she was still working in Indonesia, but she changed the spelling to Sutoro. Their daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, chose to keep the traditional spelling of her Indonesian surname. Born in Wichita, Kansas, Dunham spent her childhood in California, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, her teenage years in Mercer Island, Washington, and most of her adult life in Hawaii and Indonesia.|$|E
