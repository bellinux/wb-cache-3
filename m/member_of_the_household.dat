5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and became a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, John was passed from Eleanor into {{the care of}} a wet nurse, a {{traditional}} practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulf de Glanvill, a leading English administrator. John spent some time as a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he became a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to {{serve as a model for}} his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E

2500|$|The author Greg King {{describes}} Churchill as [...] "undoubtedly {{the most}} powerful and influential" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> queen's female appointees. One of her frequent roles was to deliver Victoria's messages to <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> K.D. Reynolds, a historian, writes that Churchill and other certain ladies [...] "were used extensively by the queen in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> and by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> who wanted <b>the</b> queen's personal approval for a course of action". After Prince Albert's death, the widowed queen sought to remove herself from low-level interactions in her household. She preferred instead to direct her ladies to act as intermediaries to other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> particularly men. As these messages were often concerning minor breaches in etiquette, Churchill was unpopular though still respected. However, Reynolds does not believe her role extended beyond <b>the</b> royal <b>household.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Leges {{was written}} between 1114 and 1118 {{by an unknown}} Norman, who is very {{likely to be the}} author of another legal work, the Quadripartitus, {{although}} some historians, including H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, argue that the two works were by different authors. The Leges was probably part of a project including the Quadripartitus, the two works being part of a planned work in four volumes to cover not only the laws of the writer's own time, but previous laws of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, as well as how to handle legal cases. As part of both works, the author has included the Charter of Liberties, which was King Henry's coronation charter promising not to follow the administrative and legal policies of his predecessor, King William II. About a third of the material in the Leges is also in the Quadripartitus. There is evidence that the author of the two works had been a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> of Gerard, who had been chancellor under Kings William I and William II before becoming Archbishop of York under Henry I. The work was likely composed at Winchester.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} John occurs in 1188 {{when he was}} {{teaching}} at Oxford. This record notes that he witnessed a legal case decided by delegated judges for the Bishop of Lincoln. Along with a few other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John {{was among the first}} securely attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani {{and was one of the}} teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers. Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law, but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied somewhere on the Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not securely attested. By the late 1190s, John was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

25|$|There are two {{distinct}} types {{of access to}} food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere. Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on. The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household's access to food. However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services. Demographics and education levels {{of members of the}} household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that are purchased. A household's access to enough and nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake of all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> The USDA adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.|$|E
