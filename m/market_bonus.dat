This study examines the stock price reaction to the information content of bonus issues {{with a view of}} examining the Indian stock market is semi-strong efficient or not. The period of the study is June 1998 to August 2004. Samples of 46 bonus issues have been used to study the announcement effect by using event study methodology. The results indicate that there are significant positive abnormal returns for a five-day period prior to bonus announcement in line with evidence from developed stock market. On the announcement day the average abnormal return of - 0. 10 % is observed.

30|$|Collective {{negotiations}} {{in the sugar}} sector. The quota system for sugar applies {{until the end of}} the 2016 / 2017 marketing year (Article 124 CMO Regulation). There will no longer be a guaranteed sugar beet price as from that date. The question arises whether growers will be able to continue to collectively negotiate prices with producers after the end of the quota regime, as is the current practice. Unlike in the milk, arable crops, olive oil and beef sectors, there is no explicit collective negotiation provision for sugar beet growers in the CMO. However, the rules for the sugar sector do provide for the collective negotiation of inter-professional agreements between associations of beet growers and sugar manufacturers (so-called agreements within the trade). The legislation has been recently integrated with a Delegated Act 7 opening the possibility to introduce a value sharing formula, including <b>market</b> <b>bonuses</b> and loses, being discussed between beet growers and manufacturers during the negotiation process.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the current}} {{challenges}} that {{the industrial world}} faces regarding the unavoidable environmental impact of manufacturing goods, companies have been turning to sustainable design {{in order to reduce}} this impact and to minimize the damage to the environment {{while at the same time}} reaping the <b>marketing</b> <b>bonus</b> that is the claim of a greener product. This reduction of environmental impact is being done at multiple levels and especially at the design stage and one of the ways taken by companies to reduce this impact is to replace fuel-based materials such as polymers with natural materials. But in order for this replacement to take place, engineers and designers need to know the behavior of these materials. With that idea a set of mechanical tests and studies, namely bending and compression tests, have been performed on cork composites. Those composites were chosen for its importance to the Portuguese economy and its peculiar growth cycle and harvesting techniques, in order to ascertain the mechanical properties of cork composites and how it stands against polymers...|$|R

It studies how the dynamics of a two-dimensional discrete time map evolves by focusing on changes either {{in the degree of}} product differentiation or the managerial power in the <b>market</b> share <b>bonus.</b> By combining mathematical techniques and numerical experiments, it shows that the Nash equilibrium of the game may not describe the long-term outcomes of the market. This holds because the fixed point of the map may be unstable or because different attractors (simple or chaotic) may capture the long-term dynamics of the model. The article also analyzes market dynamics when a new potential entrant tries to enter or, alternatively, a firm that was already in the market closes down and then tries to re-enter in a context where there is already an incumbent with a strictly positive quantity. The potential entrant may be subject to entry barriers or enters the market depending on the structure of consumers' preferences and the demands of products of both varieties. In particular, the article analyzes some economic consequences of the non-invertibility of the map in the entry process...|$|R

We model the relationship between realized CEO pay and an earnings-adjusted barrier call as the dependent variable.

Salary sensitivities to the dependent variable are broadly consistent with determination of a reservation wage set by the executive labor <b>market,</b> while annual <b>bonuses</b> are paid for expected above-target performance, but are also capped. Long-term incentive plans are used to mitigate noise in earnings only when above-target performance is expected. Hence, we find no evidence of ‘excessive’ bonuses, at least during the interval ending in fiscal 2005. Rather, we document evidence that the ‘excessiveness’ may in fact be present in salaries.

40|$|Choice probabilities {{and related}} outputs of {{discrete}} choice models form a critical input to many travel demand forecasting and transport project evaluation studies. The decision rule underlying a discrete choice model describes how individuals make their decisions and thereby co-determines the choice probabilities. Uncertainty {{from the side}} of the analyst regarding the underlying decision rule(s) may therefore translate into alternative predictions regarding the behavioural response to changing travel conditions. In this paper, we contrast the well-known Random Utility Maximization framework, on which most travel demand forecasts are based, with its Random Regret Minimization counterpart. Based on a review of the existing empirical comparisons between the two frameworks we discuss the connections and dissimilarities between both model types and the associated implications for travel demand forecasting. The empirical comparisons reveal that both models perform about equally well in terms of model fit and external validation, which makes it hard to identify one model as a superior specification for forecasting. Despite these small differences in overall model fit, choice probabilities and elasticities can differ substantially (and predictably) in specific choice-contexts. One such example is the compromise effect where the Random Regret Minimization framework predicts a <b>market</b> share <b>bonus</b> for ‘in-between’ alternatives. The paper discusses model averaging techniques to generate predictions when a clear winning model cannot be identified. Finally, the paper puts these considerations in the context of a regret-based Dutch National Model, which is currently under construction.

40|$|The global {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} uneven recovery from it {{have been at the}} forefront of public debate for over a year. Millions of workers around the globe have lost their jobs; millions of others are working fewer hours than they want; millions more are experiencing work intensification and longer hours for reduced pay; and many others are sitting precariously balanced, somewhere on the continuum that stretches between these two extremes. A small number of individuals have been singled out as responsible for the situation and they are paying a penalty. But with few exceptions their penalty is rarely more serious than the loss of their own jobs. Many more are still enjoying the fruits of decisions and structures that reap rewards gleaned in over a decade's frenzy in almost unfettered <b>markets,</b> exorbitant <b>bonuses</b> and executive salaries, and all done with the complicity of the state. The response of nation states to the crisis has been undertaken with speed, efficacy and, perhaps least expectedly, a return to Keynesian demand-driven solutions. The question is why has this globally uneven transition from crisis to recovery taken place? And most importantly what does this mean for labour? We argue here that a major tool to understand this is political economy for it provides an analytic framework and a diagnostic tool used to find new directions.

40|$|Excerpt] Class is {{the last}} great taboo in the United States. It is, {{according}} to Noam Chomsky, “the unmentionable five-letter word. ” Even in this period of growing economic inequality, we hardly ever talk about class. We hear daily, in the mainstream media, about unemployment, bailouts, proposed tax cuts or tax hikes, Congress regulating one industry and deregulating another, budget cuts, recession, recovery, roller-coaster <b>markets,</b> CEO <b>bonuses,</b> and more. Given all the attention to economics, {{it is interesting that}} talk about social class has been so skimpy. Sometimes I think of class as our collective, national family secret. And, as any therapist will tell you, family secrets are problematic. With rare exceptions, we just don’t talk about class in the United States. Most of us believe that the United States is a classless society, one that is basically middle class (except for a few unfortu­nate poor people and some lucky rich ones). Sometimes talk about class is really about race. We have no shared language about class. We have been taught from childhood myths and misconceptions around class mobility and the American dream. Many of us are confused about class and don’t tend to think about it as consciously as we might our race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, or sexual orientation. Nonetheless, our class identity has a huge impact on every aspect of our lives: from parenting style to how we speak, from what we dare to dream to the likelihood we will spend time in prison, from how we spend our days to how many days we have. We are living in a period of extraordinary economic insecurity and inequality. It is an inequality that crushes the poor, drains the working class, eliminates the middle class, simultaneously aggrandizes and dehumanizes the rich, and disembowels democracy...|$|R
