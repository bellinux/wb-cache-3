40|$|The {{tropical}} soils systems {{cover more}} than 1 / 3 of the emerged earth. The {{knowledge of the}} shallow structures is crucial for the understanding of global pedological functioning of soils. Multifrequency radar and pole-pole <b>multi-electrode</b> <b>DC</b> resistivity surveys were conducted here along the 950 meters long main traverse of Nsimi watershed to delineate the main pedological horizons. The results of pole-pole survey are interpreted using RES 2 DINV software, which allows a rapid 2 -D inversion. The resulting image shows the main structures from shallow depth to more than 80 meters deep. Features like major fault, bedrock topography or altered zones are clearly defined. In order to image the shallower part of the section, the radar and a more detailed electrical section are presented together and compared to dense pedological observations available on this traverse. In the first ten meters, the main radar reflectors at 25 MHz and iso-resistivity curves correlate themselves. This allows to give precise indications to the pedologist who can locate more accurately observation pits or borehole investigations {{as well as to}} give precise geometrical limits to pedo-hydrogeologic models.

40|$|DCs {{represent}} the major cell type leading to polarized T-helper (Th) cell responses in vivo. Here, we {{asked whether the}} instruction of murine Th 2 responses by DCs matured with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF is qualitatively different from maturation by different types of TLR 4 /MyD 88 -dependent variant-specific surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei). The results obtained by analyzing DC surface markers, Notch ligand mRNA, cytokines, asthma, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models as well as performing microarrays indicate that both types of stimuli induce similar inflammatory, semi-mature <b>DC</b> <b>profiles.</b> <b>DCs</b> matured by TNF or VSG treatment expressed a common inflammatory signature of 24 genes correlating with their Th 2 -polarization capacity. However, the same 24 genes and 4498 additional genes were expressed by DCs treated with LPS that went on to induce Th 1 cells. These findings support {{the concept of a}} default pathway for Th 2 -cell induction in DCs matured under suboptimal or inflammatory conditions, independent of the surface receptors and signaling pathways involved. Our data also indicate that quantitative differences in DC maturation might direct Th 2 - vs Th 1 -cell responses, since suboptimally matured inflammatory DCs induce default Th 2 -cell maturation, whereas fully mature DCs induce Th 1 -cell maturation. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Simulations are {{expected}} to be the powerful tool to investigate the baryon effects on dark matter (DM) halos. Recent high resolution, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Cintio 14, DC 14) predict that the inner density profiles of DM halos depend systematically on the ratio of stellar to DM mass (M_∗/M_ halo) which is thought to be able to provide good fits to the observed rotation curves of galaxies. The <b>DC</b> 14 <b>profile</b> is fitted from the simulations which are confined to M_ halo< 10 ^ 12 M_, in order to investigate the physical processes that may affect all halos, we extrapolate it to much larger halo mass, including that of galaxy clusters. The inner slope of <b>DC</b> 14 <b>profile</b> is flat for low halo mass, it approaches 1 when the halo mass increases towards 10 ^ 12 M_ and decreases rapidly after that mass. We use <b>DC</b> 14 <b>profile</b> for lenses and find that it predicts too few lenses compared with the most recent strong lensing observations SQLS (Inada 12). We also calculate the strong lensing probabilities for a simulated density profile which continues the halo mass from the mass end of DC 14 (∼ 10 ^ 12 M_) to the mass that covers the galaxy clusters (Schaller 15, Schaller 15), and find that this Schaller 15 model predict too many lenses compared with other models and SQLS observations. Interestingly, Schaller 15 profile has no core, however, like DC 14, the rotation curves of the simulated halos are in excellent agreement with observational data.

Methods. Monocyte-derived DCs maturation was elicited by their direct exposure to the LAB strains of L. rhamnosus 900 or L. paracasei 915 (antagonistic and nonantagonistic to H. pylori, resp.), in the presence or absence of H. pylori strain cagA+. The <b>DCs</b> maturation <b>profile</b> was assessed on the basis of surface markers expression and cytokines production. Results. We observed that the LAB strains and the mixtures of LAB with H. pylori are able to induce mature DCs. At the same time, the L. paracasei 915 leads to high IL- 10 /IL- 12 p 70 cytokine ratio, in contrast to L. rhamnosus 900. Conclusions.

40|$|The ocular {{microenvironment}} is immunosuppressive {{in animal}} models of {{antigen presenting cell}} function. My hypothesis was that in humans the normal ocular microenvironment maintains an immature dendritic cell (DC) phenotype, whereas in intraocular inflammation (uveitis) this regulation fails, permitting full DC maturation leading to the production and recruitment of pathogenic effector T cells to the eye. Using an in vitro model of DC function, I observed that non-inflammatory aqueous humour (AqH) inhibited DC maturation, with reduced MHC and CD 86 expression, and reduced capacity to induce proliferation of allogeneic T cells, an effect which was cortisol and TGFβ 2 dependent. In contrast, exposure to uveitis AqH generated a distinct <b>DC</b> <b>profile</b> with IFNγ dependent elevation of MHC class I, but reduced MHC class II and CD 86 expression and impaired induction of T cell proliferation. Exposure to uveitis AqH from patients on topical glucocorticoid treatment caused additional suppression of CD 86.

40|$|Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) {{are central}} in allergy as {{regulators}} of the Th 1 /Th 2 balance. We have recently demonstrated a unique transcriptional <b>profile</b> of <b>DCs</b> {{in patients with}} ongoing allergy compared with healthy subjects and shown that crosstalk between DCs and memory T cells affects the transcriptional profile of T cells. However, the transcriptional <b>profile</b> of <b>DCs</b> educated by T cells in allergy is unknown. Methods: In the present study, we have examined the transcriptional <b>profiles</b> of <b>DCs</b> after stimulation with grass pollen allergens, Phleum pratense and coculture with autologous CD 4 + memory T cells using high-density microarray. Protein analysis was performed using flow cytometry and recombinant antibody protein microarrays. Patients with allergic rhinitis and healthy subjects were compared. Results: The results reveal a distinct T-cell-induced <b>DC</b> <b>profile</b> in atopic individuals. Accordingly, about 170 genes were upregulated and 40 genes downregulated. For example, the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD 30 were upregulated in DCs derived from atopic donors, and this could also be verified at the protein level.

The phenotype and localisation of DCs were characterised by immunohistochemistry and double-labelling immunofluorescence in lung samples from controls, human IPAH patients and an experimental pulmonary hypertension model (monocrotaline-exposed rats). As compared with controls, morphometric analysis demonstrated increased numbers of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) -positive cells in muscular pulmonary arteries in IPAH and OX- 62 -positive DCs in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. In human samples, the mean¡SEM number of DC-SIGN-positive cells?artery- 1 of 100 – 300 mm diameter was 1. 4 ¡ 0. 4 in controls versus 26. 4 ¡ 2. 7 in IPAH.

40|$|Although {{allogeneic}} {{stem cell}} transplantation (allo-SCT) can elicit graft-versus-tumor (GVT) immunity, patients often relapse due to residual tumor cells. As essential orchestrators {{of the immune}} system, vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) is an appealing strategy to boost the GVT response. Nevertheless, durable clinical responses after DC vaccination are still limited, stressing {{the need to improve}} current DC vaccines. Aiming to empower DC potency, we engineered monocyte-derived DCs to deprive them of ligands for the immune checkpoint regulated by programmed death 1 (PD- 1). We also equipped them with interleukin (IL) - 15 "transpresentation" skills. Transfection with short interfering (si) RNA targeting the PD- 1 ligands PD-L 1 and PD-L 2, in combination with IL 15 and IL 15 Ralpha mRNA, preserved their mature <b>DC</b> <b>profile</b> and rendered the DCs superior in inducing T-cell proliferation and IFNgamma and TNFalpha production. Translated into an ex vivo hematological disease setting, DCs deprived of PD- 1 ligands (PD-L), equipped with IL 15 /IL 15 Ralpha expression, or most effectively, both, induced superior expansion of minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells from transplanted cancer patients. These data support the combinatorial approach of in situ suppression of the PD-L inhibitory checkpoints with DC-mediated IL 15 transpresentation to promote antigen-specific T-cell responses and, ultimately, contribute to GVT immunity.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{acceptance}} that glycans are centrally implicated in immunity, exactly how {{they contribute to}} the tilt immune response remains poorly defined. In this study, we sought to evaluate {{the impact of the}} malignant phenotype-associated glycan, sialyl-Tn (STn) in the function of the key orchestrators of the immune response, the dendritic cells (DCs). In high grade bladder cancer tissue, the STn antigen is significantly overexpressed and correlated with the increased expression of ST 6 GALNAC 1 sialyltransferase. Bladder cancer tissue presenting elevated expression of ST 6 GALNAC 1 showed a correlation with increased expression of CD 1 a, a marker for bladder immature DCs and showed concomitant low levels of Th 1 -inducing cytokines IL- 12 and TNF-α. In vitro, human DCs co-incubated with STn+ bladder cancer cells, had an immature phenotype (MHC-IIlow, CD 80 low and CD 86 low) and were unresponsive to further maturation stimuli. When contacting with STn+ cancer cells, DCs expressed significantly less IL- 12 and TNF-α. Consistent with a tolerogenic <b>DC</b> <b>profile,</b> T cells that were primed by DCs pulsed with antigens derived from STn+ cancer cells were not activated and showed a FoxP 3 high IFN-γlow phenotype. Blockade of STn antigens and of STn+ glycoprotein, CD 44 and MUC 1, in STn+ cancer cells was able to lower the induction of tolerance and DCs become more mature. Overall, our data suggest that STn-expressing cancer cells impair DC maturation and endow DCs with a tolerogenic function, limiting their capacity to trigger protective anti-tumour T cell responses. STn antigens and, in particular, STn+ glycoproteins are potential targets for circumventing tumour-induced tolerogenic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Uterine {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) {{are critical}} for activating the T cell response mediating maternal immune tolerance of the semiallogeneicfetus. GM-CSF (CSF 2), a known regulator of DCs, is synthesized by uterine epithelial cells during induction of tolerance in early pregnancy. To investigate the role of GM-CSF in regulating uterine DCs and macrophages, Csf 2 -null mutant and wild-type mice were evaluated at estrus, and in the periconceptual and peri-implantation periods. Immunohistochemistry showed no effect of GM-CSF deficiency on numbers of uterine CD 11 c+ cells and F 4 / 80 + macrophages at estrus or on days 0. 5 and 3. 5 postcoitum, but MHC class II+ and class A scavenger receptor+ cells were fewer. Flow cytometry revealed reduced CD 80 and CD 86 expression by uterine CD 11 c+ cells and reduced MHC class II in both CD 11 c+ and F 4 / 80 + cells from GM-CSF–deficient mice. CD 80 and CD 86 were induced in Csf 2 −/− uterine CD 11 c+ cells by culture with GM-CSF. Substantially reduced ability to activate both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in vivo was evident after delivery of OVA Ag by mating with Act-mOVA males or transcervical administration of OVA peptides. This study shows that GM-CSF regulates the efficiency with which uterine DCs and macrophages activate T cells, and {{it is essential for}} optimal MHC class II- and class I-mediated indirect presentation of reproductive Ags. Insufficient GM-CSF may impair generation of T cell-mediated immune tolerance at the outset of pregnancy and may contribute to the altered <b>DC</b> <b>profile</b> and dysregulated T cell tolerance evident in infertility, miscarriage, and preeclampsia. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacitive}} resistivity (CR) {{technique is}} a generalization {{of the conventional}} DC resistivity method that facilitates measurements of electrical resistivity on engineered surfaces and highly resistive ground. The CR methodology allows the use of towed sensor arrays, thus enabling the rapid collection of high-resolution resistivity data. Under quasi-static conditions, CR data are equivalent to galvanic DC measurements so that CR datasets can be interpreted with conventional DC inversion algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that the methodology and fundamental parameters of the CR technique facilitate spatial sampling at the centimeter scale for towing speeds {{of the order of}} 2. 5  km/h. We argue that the dipole-dipole array is the most suitable geometry for dynamic CR measurements and present example data acquired with a prototype instrument using plate-wire combinations arranged in an equatorial geometry. The information content of raw CR data is found to be dominant over towing-induced noise and a direct comparison with <b>DC</b> <b>profile</b> data shows good agreement between both techniques. Based on these findings, we show that tomographic imaging is possible using datasets acquired with moving arrays. Closer investigation of the practical aspects of towed-array capacitive resistivity imaging (CRI) highlights the similarities with galvanic multi-electrode surveys, but the different geometric constraints and sampling regime of CRI give rise to advantages (high lateral resolution) as well as disadvantages (limitations in vertical resolution). We conclude our study with recommendations for practical CRI survey procedures and present a field example where we have successfully imaged a subsurface target in 3 D. Towed-array CRI is found to provide equivalent (and in some ways superior) information about the shallow subsurface when compared to DC ERT (electrical resistivity tomography); it therefore widens the scope of electrical imaging surveys to environments where the conventional methodology would be impractical. ...|$|R

40|$|Hollow cathodes {{are used}} in plasma {{contactor}} and electric propulsion devices to provide electrons for sustaining plasma discharges. Based on previous cathode life tests where erosion was observed on hollow cathode assembly components, it is desirable to understand the plasma flow field downstream of hollow cathodes. Plasma flow field measurements are presented herein for hollow cathode generated plasmas using both local and remotely located plasma diagnostics. Two cathode discharges are presented: 1) an open, no magnetic field configuration and 2) a setup simulating an ion thruster discharge chamber. In the open cathode configuration, large amplitude plasma potential oscillations, ranging from 20 V to 85 V within a 34 V discharge, were observed using a floating emissive probe. These oscillations were observed over a <b>dc</b> potential <b>profile</b> that contained a clear potential hill structure. A remotely located electrostatic analyzer (ESA) {{was used to measure}} the energy of ions produced within the plasma, and energies were detected that met and in some cases exceeded the peak plasma potentials detected by the emissive probe. In the prototype NSTAR-like discharge chamber configuration, plasma potentials from the emissive probe agreed with ion energies recorded by the remotely located ESA. A correlation model wa...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to find out if selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (antagonistic or nonantagonistic againstH. pylori in vitro) would differ in their abilities tomodulate the DCsmaturation profiles reflected by their phenotype and cytokine expression patterns. Methods. Monocyte-derived DCs maturation was elicited by their direct exposure to the LAB strains of L. rhamnosus 900 or L. paracasei 915 (antagonistic and nonantagonistic to H. pylori, resp.), in the presence or absence of H. pylori strain cagA+. The <b>DCs</b> maturation <b>profile</b> was assessed on the basis of surface markers expression and cytokines production. Results. We observed that the LAB strains and the mixtures of LAB with H. pylori are able to induce mature DCs. At the same time, the L. paracasei 915 leads to high IL- 10 /IL- 12 p 70 cytokine ratio, in contrast to L. rhamnosus 900. Conclusions. This study showed that the analyze...|$|R
40|$|The Navy of {{tomorrow}} {{will require a}} robust and reconfigurable power system capable of supplying power not only to large high power propulsion loads but to growing combat system loads like high power radar and pulse loads such as rail guns and free-electron lasers. A critical component in such a system is the phase controlled rectifier. As such, the issues associated with {{the inclusion of a}} power electronics rectifier need to be addressed. These issues include input Alternating Current (AC) interface requirements, the output Direct Current (<b>DC)</b> load <b>profile,</b> and overall stability in the presence of non-linear loads. Understanding these issues and determining the means of assuring compatibility with a Navy all-electric ship is the focus of this thesis. By using a Simulink model of a variable parameter load, several multiple-pulse count, high power rectifiers were exercised. The Simulink results were compared to the linearized small signal transfer function analysis results. These experiments led to the conclusion that increasing the pulse count and output filtering reduces the input interface current distortion. However, there are tradeoffs in terms of complexity and size of the passive components, and optimization based on source and load specifications is required.

30|$|Good spatial {{resolution}} of the low resistivity area about the hot springs and producing wells {{is needed to determine}} if the hydrothermal alteration zones of fracture systems can be imaged. Detailed lateral <b>DC</b> resistivity <b>profiles</b> or a 3 D resistivity survey should explore for deeper (50 – 200  m) hydrothermal alteration zones as indicators of the main fractures. The 500 -m FX- 2 well was drilled 200  m south of the known seepage area. We do not know the strategy of that 1995 FX- 2 location, but it is at the south edge of the 1985 resistivity survey coverage, where low apparent resistivity (30 – 50  Ωm) is shown at the south ends of lines H- 1 and H- 6 (Fig.  20). Schlumberger sounding at R 2 showed resistivity of ~  30  Ωm below 30  m depth to a depth of about 100  m (Fig.  19). It should be relatively inexpensive to obtain detailed 2 D profiling, or 3 D coverage to a depth of 200  m, and interpret this survey with respect to seepage areas and previous drilling. DC methods can be employed rapidly and inexpensively with modern equipment and processing. MT and DC data can be integrated for a complete 3 D model (W. Siripunvaraporn written communication, 2016). The survey should include the known geothermal area and be continued south to examine more closely anomalies detected by the MT survey.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLangerhans cell (LC) {{networks}} {{play key}} roles in immunity and tolerance at body surfaces. LCs are established prenatally {{and can be}} replenished from blood monocytes. Unlike skin-resident dermal DCs (dDCs) /interstitial-type DCs and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells appearing in dermatitis/eczema lesions, LCs lack key monocyte-affiliated markers. Inversely, LCs express various epithelial genes critical for their long-term peripheral tissue residency. ObjectiveDendritic cells (DCs) are functionally involved in inflammatory diseases; however, the mechanisms remained poorly understood. MethodsIn vitro differentiation models of human <b>DCs,</b> gene <b>profiling,</b> gene transduction, and immunohistology were used to identify molecules involved in DC subset specification. ResultsHere we identified the monocyte/macrophage lineage identity transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF 4) to be inhibited during LC differentiation from human blood monocytes. Conversely, KLF 4 is maintained or induced during dermal DC and monocyte-derived dendritic cell/inflammatory dendritic epidermal cell differentiation. We showed that in monocytic cells KLF 4 has to be repressed to allow their differentiation into LCs. Moreover, respective KLF 4 levels in DC subsets positively correlate with proinflammatory characteristics. We identified epithelial Notch signaling to repress KLF 4 in monocytes undergoing LC commitment. Loss of KLF 4 in monocytes transcriptionally derepresses Runt-related transcription factor 3 in response to TGF-β 1, thereby allowing LC differentiation marked by a low cytokine expression profile. ConclusionMonocyte differentiation into LCs depends on activation of Notch signaling and the concomitant loss of KLF 4...|$|R
