25|$|I return my {{acknowledgements}} to {{the different}} Reviewers for their assistance, which they have afforded me, in detecting my poetic deficiencies. I have endeavoured to avail <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> their remarks... My poems have been rightly charged with a profusion of double-epithets, and a general turgidness. I have pruned the double-epithets with no sparing hand; and used my best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of thought and diction.|$|E

I desire to absolve <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted {{from one place to}} another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.|$|E

The young prince resembled his father, {{particularly}} in his face, hair and eyes. Because of his gender and position as heir apparent, he became the center of attention, particularly for PedroII. A letter written by PedroII to his elder sister MariaII {{a few months after the}} birth of his second child—a daughter named Isabel—displayed his happiness: [...] "No news here save the good state of health of <b>myself,</b> <b>of</b> the empress, and of the little ones, who are becoming increasingly cute, principally little Afonso, who is already walking and who says many words, still half incomprehensible, the which increases their charm." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> the stuff that was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Benn {{said in his}} diaries that [...] "Today I had {{the idea}} that I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> what the world had to offer". While he {{acknowledged}} that he [...] "might be ridiculed" [...] for doing so, Benn said that [...] "But 'Wedgie Benn' and 'the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn' and all that stuff is impossible. I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time." [...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were still doing so three decades later)." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} English language uses of [...] "conscious" [...] and [...] "consciousness" [...] date back, however, to the 1500s. [...] The English word [...] "conscious" [...] originally {{derived from}} the Latin conscius (con- [...] "together" [...] and [...] "to know"), but the Latin word {{did not have the}} same meaning as our word—it meant [...] "knowing with", in other words [...] "having joint or common knowledge with another". [...] There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as [...] "knowing with oneself", or in other words [...] "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". [...] This phrase had the figurative meaning of [...] "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word [...] "conscious" [...] does. [...] In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word [...] "conscious" [...] retained the meaning of the Latin conscius. [...] For example, Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan wrote: [...] "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another." [...] The Latin phrase conscius sibi, whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as [...] "conscious to oneself" [...] or [...] "conscious unto oneself". [...] For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of [...] "being so conscious unto <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> my great weakness". [...] Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E

2500|$|Structures, Book I was {{a turning}} point for Boulez. Recognising a lack of {{expressive}} flexibility in the language (described in his essay [...] "At the Limit of Fertile Land...") Boulez loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple and strongly gestural music: [...] "I am trying to rid <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> my thumbprints and taboos", he wrote to Cage. His first venture into this new kind of serialism was a work for twelve solo voices titled Oubli signal lapidé (1952), but it was withdrawn after a single performance. Its material was reused in the 1970 composition Cummings ist der Dichter.|$|E

I cannot rid <b>myself</b> <b>of</b> this idea.' ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{would appear}} that Reuss {{discovered}} the correspondence; he wrote Crowley an angry, defensive response on November 9, 1921, in which he appeared to distance himself and O.T.O. from Thelema, which, as shown above, he had previously embraced.
