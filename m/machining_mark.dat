40|$|Single-point diamond {{turning of}} soft metals {{could provide a}} much shiny surface with an optimal feed rate; however, the <b>machining</b> <b>mark</b> would be left on the {{machined}} surface, which caused the roughness cannot be neglected. If the feed rate is too small, the roughness of the surface could be improved but the reflectiveness would be decreased because of damaging the profile. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop a lapping method to reduce the roughness by removing the <b>machining</b> <b>mark,</b> while the reflectiveness can be kept at the original level simultaneously. In this study, the novel lapping method, using strands of wool fibers to deliver the abrasive slurry to rub against the lens, was proposed for removing the machining marks on the mold of a lenticular lens by lapping without damaging the profile of the mold. Even though the normal pressure applied by the wool strands onto the mold surface is very low, the coefficient of friction would be increased significantly with the application of the abrasive slurry. The combined effect was to provide a relatively large shear force to lap the surface with a minimal normal force. Therefore, the proposed method could theoretically avoid damaging the lens while effectively removing the irregularities that appeared on the surfaces. In order to evaluate the proposed lapping method, we firstly lapped the machining marks with different lapping parameters (speed, grit size, time, and pressure) to find out the relationship between these parameters and roughness with the same profile of the mold. Secondly, the optimal lapping parameters were designed based on the above lapping results to deduce the best lapping solution for processing the machining marks. Thirdly, the lapped surface profile of the mold was test by optical profiling system, and the features of the surface can be categorized into various spectral distribution groups. Finally, by comparing the variation of the spectral distribution groups, it is verified that based on our proposed methodology, selective removal of surface spectral groups of features becomes possible.

40|$|A damaged input pinion, part No. 201 P 636 H 1302 201 bearing Sl. No. HDSN 527, {{belonging}} to Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed {{loss of material}} by spalling on the loading flank of two teeth of the pinion. Spalling was resulted due to surface contact fatigue. It was discovered that there were rough <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> on the flank of the teeth. The stress concentrators at these <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> {{were responsible for the}} premature surface contact fatigue crack initiation in the teeth. Subsequently, the surface contact fatigue has manifested in the form of spalling leading to loss of material from the loading flank surface. Evidences also suggest that probably, the working load on the pinion was in the higher side. It is believed that this in conjunction with the stress concentrators in the form of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> has accelerated the surface contact fatigue crack initiation. Laboratory test results show that the material of construction of the pinion conforms to the design specification in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, surface hardness, case depth, and core hardness. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure of the pinion. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of inlet air pressure on the surface of BrÅnemark titanium abutment cylinders. Materials and Methods : Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an inlet air pressure of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results : A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy Jet system removed <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, inlet air pressure of 60 psi caused removal of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> to a greater degree than an inlet air pressure of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower inlet air pressure causing more removal of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> than the higher inlet air pressure. Conclusions : Under the experimental conditions tested, neither of the two systems tested seemed to cause significant abrasion of the surface of titanium abutment cylinders...|$|R

40|$|Selection into GP {{speciality}} {{training is}} based on results of a multi-method job analysis study. Six key competency domains were identified as priorities to assess through the current national selection process, including empathy, communication, integrity, clinical expertise, problem-solving, and resilience. Each applicant is assessed using clinical problem-solving and situational judgement <b>machine</b> <b>marked</b> tests, followed by high fidelity exercises at regional selection centres. These show good internal reliability and predictive validity, with high correlations with subsequent job performance and outcomes in the MRCGP examinations. Candidate feedback is generally positive, where candidates prefer multiple opportunities to demonstrate their aptitude. When comparing selection methods, candidates perceive high fidelity assessments (for example, a consultation exercise with a simulated patient) as the most job relevant and fair. Emerging data provides opportunities to both streamline and re-engineer the process, so as to optimise efficiency (including cost-effectiveness) while further developing its robustness. Logistic considerations favour delivery of multiple equated versions of <b>machine</b> <b>marked</b> tests in invigilated test centres. As with other assessments in medical education, concerns remain about differential performance between UK and international medical graduates.
