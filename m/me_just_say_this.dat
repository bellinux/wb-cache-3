40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for the very clear summary of the arguments of Multicultural Citizenship. So I thought I’d just mention {{a couple of the}} ideas that I’ve been working with more recently. The first concerns this. There are two main types of groups that I’ve been thinking of - immigrant groups and national minorities. What kinds of rights are appropriate for these two different types of groups. I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities. So let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> that I hope it’s not dramatically different from what’s in the book but let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> clarify what I mean by those terms, because I will use them...|$|R
