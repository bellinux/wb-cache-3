50|$|As a {{precision}} or scientific thread, the Löwenherz form was rivaled by two contemporary forms: Swiss-designed Thury thread and its derivative the British Association thread. In modern applications, the Löwenherz thread {{has been replaced}} with the DIN 13 standard for <b>metric</b> <b>screws.</b> ISO fasteners are available {{in many of the}} same pitches and diameters as Löwenherz fasteners; however, ISO and Löwenherz fasteners are not directly interchangeable because the difference in the thread geometry prevents proper mating of fastening components (so an M6x1.0 screw could not be safely installed in a hole tapped for a 6mm Löwenherz screw, even thought they share the same pitch and nominal diameter).|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of furniture corner joints is often {{carried out by}} assembling double thread (“Trio”) nuts and metal corners. Such connections are particularly suitable for disassemble bal structures and these connections are also used for savings in transport when all the structural elements are transported in boxes and furniture is prepared for in site assembly. The assembly process consists of fastening the binding metal corners to wooden elements with the <b>metric</b> thread <b>screws.</b> To achieve the optimal quality of these joints, the production process must {{comply with the requirements}} of various products including the loading applications and strength of individual wood species. This paper examines the fundamental factors affecting the quality of such joints. Special attention was paid to the process of screwing and loading capacity of double thread nuts in three different types of wood. Optimization of the technological process was set as the ultimate goal aimed at achieving a high level of product quality. Tests have been conducted on fi r, beech and oak wood to determine optimal bore diameters and nut screwing parameters relative to the screwing resistance, extraction force and the time interval required for nut screwing...|$|R
40|$|In this work, Valanis model parameters, {{and their}} {{variation}} with bolt preload, were determined for a bolted lap joint, which consisted in two steel plates {{held together by}} a <b>metric</b> 12 <b>screw.</b> For this purpose, a series of transitory non-linear analyses were performed {{on the basis of}} a three dimensional finite element model of the bolted lap joint subjected to varying bolt preloads and tangential displacements. Curve fitting of hysteresis cycles obtained from numerical simulations allowed determination of Valanis model parameters as well as assessment of bolt preload influence on these parameters. In addition, the present numerical simulations provided information about the evolution of the contact state from stick to slip regimes between the bolted plates, reflecting the non-linear behaviour of the joint. Quasi-static tests at several preloads and tangential displacements conditions were conducted to validate Valanis model parameters previously obtained from numerical simulations. The present findings provided detailed information about the evolution of the aforementioned Valanis parameters with bolt preload. Thus, we confirmed that equivalent stiffness values corresponding to the macro-slip regime as well as the upper limit of the sticking regime (Et and σ 0, respectively) are highly influenced by bolt preload levels. These results may prove useful to appropriately design bolted joints to be used under specific stiffness and damping criteria, and therefore reducing the vibration response of the joint.

50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO metric thread form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO <b>metric</b> thread, where <b>screws</b> must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R

50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> thread, the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> thread is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> threads. The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO metric threads, and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|E
