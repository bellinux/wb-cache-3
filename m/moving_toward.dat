However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years.

5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became {{engaged in}} intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E

5|$|Koniecpolski led {{a spring}} 1627 {{military}} campaign, {{trying to keep}} the Swedish army in the Duchy of Prussia from <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> Danzig, while also intending to block their reinforcements arriving from the Holy Roman Empire. Moving quickly the Hetman recovered Puck, and then destroyed at the Battle of Czarne (Hammerstein) the forces intended for Gustavus. The Swedes themselves Koniecpolski's forces kept near Tczew, shielding the access to Danzig and preventing Gustavus Adolphus from reaching his main objective. At the Battle of Oliva the Polish ships defeated a Swedish naval squadron.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> disunion.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

5|$|Saomai {{continued}} <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> {{the northwest}} and {{passed over the}} Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. This interaction served to shift Saomai's track slightly {{to the south and}} provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the backside of Bopha.|$|E
5|$|Tanner {{told the}} police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man {{carrying}} a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine's bedroom, heading east, away {{from the front of}} apartment 5A. In {{the early days of the}} investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first arguido.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|The kabosy (or kabosa) is a four to six-stringed simple guitar {{common in}} the {{southern}} Highlands <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the east, particularly among the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups. The soundbox, which is typically square or rectangular today, was originally circular in form, first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape. Mandolina and gitara are the Antandroy names of a popular Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument's tuning.|$|E
5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
