40|$|Gene {{duplication}} {{followed by}} divergence {{is an important}} mechanism that leads to <b>molecular</b> <b>innovation.</b> Divergence of paralogous genes can be achieved at functional and regulatory levels. Whereas regulatory divergence {{at the transcriptional level}} is well documented, little is known about divergence of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Protein phosphorylation, {{one of the most important}} PTMs, has recently been shown to be an important determinant of the retention of paralogous genes. Here we test whether gains and losses of phosphorylated amino acids after gene duplication may specifically modify the regulation of these duplicated proteins. We show that when phosphosites are lost in one paralog, transitions from phosphorylated serines and threonines are significantly biased toward negatively charged amino acids, which can mimic their phosphorylated status in a constitutive manner. Our analyses support the hypothesis that divergence between paralogs can be generated by a loss of the posttranslational regulatory control on a function rather than by the complete loss of the function itself. Surprisingly, these favoured transitions cannot be reached by single mutational steps, which suggests that the function of a phosphosite needs to be completely abolished before it is restored through substitution by these phosphomimetic residues. We conclude by discussing how gene duplication could facilitate the transitions between phosphorylated and phosphomimetic amino acids...|$|E

These apparent anomalies can be resolved by adopting an alternative, pre-adaptive scenario.

40|$|Transposons are mobile genetic {{elements}} that threaten {{the survival of}} species by destabilizing the germline genomes. Limiting the spread of these selfish elements is imperative. Germ cells employ specialized small regulatory RNA pathways to restrain transposon activity. PIWI proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level with loss-of-function mutant animals universally exhibiting sterility often associated with germ cell defects. This short review aims to illustrate basic strategies of piRNA-guided defense against transposons. Mechanisms of piRNA silencing are most readily studied in Drosophila melanogaster, {{which serves as a}} model to delineate molecular concepts and as a reference for mammalian piRNA systems. PiRNA pathways utilize two major strategies to handle the challenges of transposon control: (1) the hard-wired molecular memory of prior transpositions enables recognition of mobile genetic elements and discriminates transposons from host genes; (2) a feed-forward adaptation mechanism shapes piRNA populations to selectively combat the immediate threat of transposon transcripts. In flies, maternally contributed PIWI-piRNA complexes bolster both of these lines of defense and ensure transgenerational immunity.

40|$|Background: Gene {{duplication}} is {{a source}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>innovation</b> throughout evolution. However, even with massive amounts of genome sequence data, correlating gene duplication with speciation and other events in natural history can be difficult. This is especially true in its most interesting cases, where rapid and multiple duplications are likely to reflect adaptation to rapidly changing environments and life styles. This may be so for Class I of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH 1 s), where multiple duplications occurred in primate lineages in Old and New World monkeys (OWMs and NWMs) and hominoids. Methodology/Principal Findings: To build a preferred model for the natural history of ADH 1 s, we determined the sequences of nine new ADH 1 genes, finding for the first time multiple paralogs in various prosimians (lemurs, strepsirhines). Database mining then identified novel ADH 1 paralogs in both macaque (an OWM) and marmoset (a NWM).

40|$|New genes {{can arise}} by {{duplication}} and divergence, {{but there is}} a fundamental gap in our understanding of the relationship between these genes, the evolving proteins they encode, and the fitness of the organism. Here we used crystallography, NMR dynamics, kinetics, and mass spectrometry to explain the <b>molecular</b> <b>innovations</b> that arose during a previous real-time evolution experiment. In that experiment, the (beta alpha) (8) barrel enzyme HisA was under selection for two functions (HisA and TrpF), resulting in duplication and divergence of the hisA gene to encode TrpF specialists, HisA specialists, and bifunctional generalists. We found that selection affects enzyme structure and dynamics, and thus substrate preference, simultaneously and sequentially. Bifunctionality is associated with two distinct sets of loop conformations, each essential for one function. We observed two mechanisms for functional specialization: structural stabilization of each loop conformation and substrate-specific adaptation of the active site. Intracellular enzyme performance, calculated as the product of catalytic efficiency and relative expression level, was not linearly related to fitness. Instead, we observed thresholds for each activity above which further improvements in catalytic efficiency had little if any effect on growth rate. Overall, we have shown how beneficial substitutions selected during real-time evolution can lead to manifold changes in enzyme function and bacterial fitness. This work emphasizes the speed at which adaptive evolution can yield enzymes with sufficiently high activities such that they no longer limit the growth of their host organism, and confirms the (beta alpha) (8) barrel as an inherently evolvable protein scaffold.

40|$|International audienceCollagens {{are thought}} to {{represent}} {{one of the most}} important <b>molecular</b> <b>innovations</b> in the metazoan line. Basement membrane type IV collagen is present in all Eumetazoa and was found in Homoscleromorpha, a sponge group with a well-organized epithelium, which may represent the first stage of tissue differentiation during animal evolution. In contrast, spongin seems to be a demosponge-specific collagenous protein, which can totally substitute an inorganic skeleton, such as in the well-known bath sponge. In the freshwater sponge Ephydatia m?ri, we previously characterized a family of short-chain collagens that are likely to be main components of spongins. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based methods, we present evidence of remote homology between the carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous NC 1 domain of spongin short-chain collagens and type IV collagen. Unexpectedly, spongin short-chain collagen-related proteins were retrieved in nonsponge animals, suggesting that a family related to spongin constitutes an evolutionary sister to the type IV collagen family. Formation of the ancestral NC 1 domain and divergence of the spongin short-chain collagen-related and type IV collagen families may have occurred before the parazoan-eumetazoan split, the earliest divergence among extant animal phyla. Molecular phylogenetics based on NC 1 domain sequences suggest distinct evolutionary histories for spongin short-chain collagen-related and type IV collagen families that include spongin short-chain collagen-related gene loss in the ancestors of Ecdyzosoa and of vertebrates. The fact that a majority of invertebrates encodes spongin short-chain collagen-related proteins raises the important question to the possible function of its members.

In recent years, components of the CBB-assembly machinery have been identified, but little is known about their regulation and evolution. Given the diversity of cellular contexts encountered in eukaryotes, but the remarkable conservation of CBB morphology, we asked whether general mechanistic principles could explain CBB assembly. We analysed the distribution of each component of the human CBB-assembly machinery across eukaryotes as a strategy to generate testable hypotheses. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS 6, SAS 4 /CPAP and BLD 10 /CEP 135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. Unexpectedly, other players (SAK/PLK 4, SPD 2 /CEP 192 and CP 110) emerged in a taxon-specific manner. We report that gene duplication {{plays an important role in}} the evolution of CBB components and show that, in the case of BLD 10 /CEP 135, this is a source of tissue specificity in CBB and flagella biogenesis. Moreover, we observe extreme protein divergence amongst CBB components and show experimentally that there is loss of cross-species complementation among SAK/PLK 4 family members, suggesting species-specific adaptations in CBB assembly. We propose that the UNIMOD theory explains the conservation of CBB architecture and that taxon- and tissue-specific <b>molecular</b> <b>innovations,</b> gained through emergence, duplication and divergence, play important roles in coordinating CBB biogenesis and function in different cellular contexts.

40|$|Background The {{digestive}} {{systems of}} animals can become highly specialized {{in response to}} their exploration and occupation of new ecological niches. Although studies on different animals have revealed commonalities in gut formation, the model systems Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which belong to the invertebrate group Ecdysozoa, exhibit remarkable deviations in how their intestines develop. Their morphological and developmental idiosyncrasies have hindered reconstructions of ancestral gut characters for the Ecdysozoa, and limit comparisons with vertebrate models. In this respect, the phylogenetic position, and slow evolving morphological and molecular characters of marine priapulid worms advance them as a key group to decipher evolutionary events {{that occurred in the}} lineages leading to C. elegans and D. melanogaster. Results In the priapulid Priapulus caudatus, the gut consists of an ectodermal foregut and anus, and a mid region of at least partial endodermal origin. The inner gut develops into a 16 -cell primordium devoid of visceral musculature, arranged in three mid tetrads and two posterior duplets. The mouth invaginates ventrally and shifts to a terminal anterior position as the ventral anterior ectoderm differentially proliferates. Contraction of the musculature occurs as the head region retracts into the trunk and resolves the definitive larval body plan. Despite obvious developmental differences with C. elegans and D. melanogaster, the expression in P. caudatus of the gut-related candidate genes NK 2. 1, foxQ 2, FGF 8 / 17 / 18, GATA 456, HNF 4, wnt 1, and evx demonstrate three distinct evolutionarily conserved molecular profiles that correlate with morphologically identified sub-regions of the gut. Conclusions The comparative analysis of priapulid development suggests that a midgut formed by a single endodermal population of vegetal cells, a ventral mouth, and the blastoporal origin of the anus are ancestral features in the Ecdysozoa. Our molecular data on P. caudatus reveal a conserved ecdysozoan gut-patterning program and demonstrates that extreme morphological divergence has not been accompanied by major <b>molecular</b> <b>innovations</b> in transcriptional regulators during digestive system evolution in the Ecdysozoa. Our data help us understand the origins of the ecdysozoan body plan, including those of C. elegans and D. melanogaster, and this is critical for comparisons between these two prominent model systems and their vertebrate counterparts...|$|R
40|$|Research {{seeking to}} {{understand}} the <b>molecular</b> <b>innovations</b> involved in transitioning from unicellular to multicellular life has been limited {{by a lack of}} closely related unicellular and multicellular organisms able to serve as tractable model systems. The volvocine green algae overcome such limitations. Its members include Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (unicellular) and Volvox carteri (multicellular), which shared a common ancestor ~ 200 million years ago. V. carteri contains two cell types: reproductive gonidia and motile, terminally differentiated somatic cells. The regA gene product (RegA) is required for somatic cell fate and, when mutated, produces the Reg mutant phenotype. Reg mutant somatic cells develop normally during {{the first day of the}} life cycle, but dedifferentiate, then develop into gonidia. This conversion from spatial to temporal cell differentiation makes RegA an intriguing candidate for elucidating the molecular origins of one key aspect of multicellularity in the volvocine algae. Using comparative genomics, the products of regA and regA -like (rls) genes were found to contain a putative DNA-binding domain (VARL, for Volvocine-Algal-RegA-Like), also encoded by several C. reinhardtii genes. This dissertation addresses the evolutionary origins of RegA structure and function, as well as its role as a putative transcription factor. Using Rt-PCR I discovered that the rlsA, rlsE, rlsF, and rlsH mRNAs are spliced to produce VARL-domain proteins; however, rlsC and rlsG mRNAs are not. To address a possible role for RegA as a transcription factor, I generated a plasmid encoding a GFP-RegA fusion, which rescued regA loss of function mutants. I then optimized a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) platform for use in V. carteri, and validated ChIP by examining histone occupancy at the hsp 70 A promoter. I discovered that heat shock decreases unmodified histone H 3 occupancy; increases relative H 3 k 4 me 1, H 3 K 14 ac and pan-acetylated histone H 4 levels; but has no effect on the relative H 3 K 4 me 3 levels. I used ChIP, followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to identify DNA targets of RegA. No statistically significant sequences were identified, but non-statistically significant enrichment was detected at the promoter and eleventh intron of the retinoblastoma-related 1 (rbr 1) gene. I confirmed enrichment by ChIP-qPCR, suggesting that RegA might regulate rbr 1 during somatic cell terminal differentiation...|$|R

Evolution is {{the unifying}} theory behind biology, and {{has entered the}} {{mainstream}} of computational and molecular biology {{as a result of}} genomics. Nevertheless, evolutionary ideas today only barely influence the practice of <b>molecular</b> sciences. <b>Innovation</b> in many areas will be required before evolutionary analyses provide utility to biomedicine and biotechnology. Research in our laboratory attempts to enhance our understanding of evolutionary processes and structure-function relationships in the long-term, while also generating novel biomolecules having technological and therapeutic value in the short-term. If successful, these innovations will add utility to genome sequence data far beyond that found in comparative genomics. Using information extracted from molecular evolutionary analyses to guide the engineering of proteins is an innovative addition to existing methods. If evolution-guided engineering can deliver biomolecular properties not otherwise attainable with traditional engineering/directed evolution techniques, then this approach will have wide utility. The above activities form the foundation of our attempt to develop an evolutionary synthetic biology. We are energized by the prospect of joining evolutionary biology and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology appears to mean different things to different scientific disciplines.

40|$|Gene {{duplication}} {{is a major}} {{mechanism for}} <b>molecular</b> evolutionary <b>innovation.</b> Young gene duplicates typically exhibit elevated rates of protein evolution and, according {{to a number of}} recent studies, increased expression divergence. However, the nature of these changes is still poorly understood. To gain novel insights into the functional consequences of gene duplication, we have undertaken an in-depth analysis of a large data set of gene families containing primate- and/or rodent-specific gene duplicates. We have found a clear tendency toward an increase in protein, promoter, and expression divergence with increasing number of duplication events undergone by each gene since the human–mouse split. In addition, gene duplication is significantly associated with a reduction in expression breadth and intensity. Interestingly, it is possible to identify three main groups regarding the evolution of gene expression following gene duplication. The first group, which comprises around 25 % of the families, shows patterns compatible with tissue-expression partitioning. The second and largest group, comprising 33 – 53 % of the families, shows broad expression of one of the gene copies and reduced, overlapping, expression of the other copy or copies. This can be attributed, in most cases, to loss of expression in several tissues of one or more gene copies. Finally, a substantial number of families, 19 – 35 %, maintain a very high level of tissue-expression overlap (. 0. 8) after tens of millions of years of evolution.

Biomarkers interact chemically with their surroundings and in turn alter the image according to molecular changes occurring within the area of interest. This process is markedly different from previous methods of imaging which primarily imaged differences in qualities such as density or water content. This ability to image fine molecular changes opens up an incredible number of exciting possibilities for medical application, including early detection and treatment of disease and basic pharmaceutical development. Furthermore, molecular imaging allows for quantitative tests, imparting {{a greater degree of}} objectivity to the study of these areas. One emerging technology is MALDI molecular imaging based on mass spectrometry. Many areas of research are being conducted in the field of molecular imaging. Much research is currently centered on detecting what is known as a predisease state or molecular states that occur before typical symptoms of a disease are detected. Other important veins of research are the imaging of gene expression and the development of novel biomarkers. Organizations such as the SNMMI Center for <b>Molecular</b> Imaging <b>Innovation</b> and Translation (CMIIT) have formed to support research in this field. In Europe, other [...] "networks of excellence" [...] such as DiMI (Diagnostics in Molecular Imaging) or EMIL (European Molecular Imaging Laboratories) work on this new science, integrating activities and research in the field. In this way, a European Master Programme [...] "EMMI" [...] is being set up to train a new generation of professionals in molecular imaging.|$|R

Recent imaging and <b>molecular</b> biomarker <b>innovations</b> provide unprecedented opportunities for improved TBI precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. Complete integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and patient stratification remains an unmet challenge. Methods and findings The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP 1), and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK 1, COMT, DRD 2). Conclusions TDA identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI that were significantly predicted {{by the presence of}} specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in TBI patients.

30|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of the}} adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations. It is a conceptual sphere of knowledge that magically expands as you explore it. You begin by combining exiting hunches of knowledge, each leading to a new possibilities which have not been there before. By expanding the body of knowledge, the possibilities of combinations expand too; therefore, we develop away from chaos (entropy) and toward complexity and order (negative entropy). Throughout history, qualitative changes in technology have always been toward more complexity (Rifkin and Howard 1981). Comparing the intellectual capacity of humans to a random experiment of combinations, as it happens with molecules, seems far-fetched. Indeed is our brain capable of much more, especially building a coherent story out of individual hunches. On a basic neuronal level, it is, however, just that: making connections. Studying the properties of disruptive innovations, Goldberg et al. (2003) found that 85 % of successful innovations are built on exiting ideas but modified by subtraction, division, merging, or multiplication. In contrast to <b>molecular</b> connections, thus, <b>innovations</b> can not only emerge by combinatory methods but also by modifying exiting technologies.|$|R

In this study, we used prostate cancer (PC) - 3 as the cell line {{to study the}} effects of DLBS 4847 on prostatic cell viability, as well as related molecular changes associated with the decreased cell number. The observation revealed that DLBS 4847 inhibited the growth of PC 3 cells through downregulation of the 5 α-reductase (5 AR) pathway. At the transcription level, 5 AR 1 and androgen-receptor gene expressions were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 5 AR- 1 and dihydrotestosterone expression were also downregulated at the protein level. A microarray study was also performed to see the effects of DLBS 4847 on differential gene expressions in prostate cancer 3 cells. Among others, DLBS 4847 downregulated genes related to prostate growth and hypertrophy. Our results suggested that DLBS 4847 could potentially become an alternative treatment for prostate disorders, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. In this regard, DLBS 4847 exerts its growth inhibition partially through downregulation of the 5 AR pathway.

40|$|A {{life history}} {{involving}} alternation of two developmentally associated, multicellular generations (sporophyte and gametophyte) is an autapomorphy of embryophytes (bryophytesphytes + vascular plants). Microfossil {{data indicate that}} Mid Late Ordovician land plants possessed such a life cycle, and that the origin of alternation of generations preceded this date. Molecular phylogenetic data unambiguously relate charophycean green algae to the ancestry of monophyletic embryophytes, and identify bryophytes as early-divergent land plants. Comparison of reproduction in charophyceans and bryophytes suggests that the following stages occurred during evolutionary origin of embryophytic alternation of generations: (i) origin of oogamy; (ii) retention of eggs and zygotes on the parental thallus; (iii) origin of matrotrophy (regulated transfer of nutritional and morphogenetic solutes from parental cells to the next generation); (iv) origin of a multicellular sporophyte generation; and (v) origin of non-flagellate, walled spores. Oogamy, egg/zygote retention and matrotrophy characterize at least some modern charophvceans, and are postulated to represent pre-adaptative features inherited by embryophytes from ancestral charophyceans. Matrotrophy is hypothesized to have preceded origin of the multicellular sporophytes of' plants, and to represent a critical <b>innovation.</b> <b>Molecular</b> approaches {{to the study of}} the origins of matrotrophy include assessment of hexose transporter genes and protein family members and their expression patterns.

Boerl (Thymelaceae). This bioactive fraction is a potential treatment for dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. The present study investigated the pharmacological action of DLBS 1442 in endometrial cells. The effect of various doses of DLBS 1442 (0 – 200 µg/mL) over 24 hours was studied using the human endometrial RL 95 - 2 cell line to observe its effect on angiogenesis, cell migration, estrogen and progesterone receptor levels, the eicosanoid pathway, cell viability, and apoptosis. The impact of DLBS 1442 on nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the eicosanoid pathway was also studied through its marker gene expression using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method. DLBS 1442 showed an ability to inhibit angiogenesis and cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 100  µg/mL, DLBS 1442 increased the cell population in sub-G 1 phase from 7 % to 34 %. DLBS 1442 also significantly downregulated the estrogen receptor level and upregulated the progesterone receptor level. Further, it inhibited the eicosanoid signaling pathway by reducing the NFκB transcription level and subsequent reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase. A dose-dependent decrease in viability and increased apoptosis in RL 95 - 2 cells were also evident after exposure to DLBS 1442, where the IC 50 was obtained at around 100 µg/mL. In conclusion, DLBS 1442 is a potential agent for alleviating symptoms of endometriosis via its antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and proapoptotic activity.
