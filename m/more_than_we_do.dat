2500|$|In {{the same}} year of FreeHand 4 release, Adobe Systems {{announced}} merger plans with Aldus Corporation for $525 million. Fear {{about the end of}} competition between these two leading applications was reported in the media and expressed by customers (Illustrator versus FreeHand and Photoshop versus PhotoStyler.) [...] Because of this overlapping of the market, Altsys stepped in by suing Aldus, saying that the merger deal was “a prima facie violation of a non-compete clause within the FreeHand licensing agreement.” Altsys CEO Jim Von Ehr explained, [...] "No one loves FreeHand <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> We will {{do whatever it takes to}} see it survive." [...] The Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint of Adobe Systems on October 18, 1994, ordering a divestiture of FreeHand to “remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission’s complaint,” and further, the FTC ordering, [...] "That for a period of ten (10) years from the date on which this order becomes final, respondents shall not, without the prior approval of the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships, or otherwise ... Acquire any Professional Illustration Software or acquire or enter into any exclusive license to Professional Illustration Software;" [...] (referring to FreeHand.) ...|$|E
60|$|SCHNEIDEKIND. But so have you, sir. We've all {{joined the}} Revolution. She doesn't mean it any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Peter. [...] "They don't {{go until}} Jack Frost makes them. I don't {{know of any}} one that we miss <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that. <b>We</b> wanted Pennington <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> this fellow. But I am glad we got {{at least one}} of them. As I {{understand}} it they work hand-in-glove with each other;" [...] and then the two Russian officers passed on.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Campbell, {{publisher}} of US Aviator magazine said: [...] "I find this really sad. Nobody {{wanted to see}} him succeed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> but {{the problem here is that}} there have been hundreds of failures, dozens of accidents and nine fatalities among 100 flying helicopters".|$|R
5000|$|... "Seir Kieran were victorious {{last year}} because they wanted it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> While some of their lads might not be all that skillful, they all have great spirit and would die for their parish. Certainly they will go out and give it {{everything}} on the day." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDER MISS WETHERELL. Do you know, I {{really think}} they feel it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> I found Peggy crying about it yesterday, in the scullery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now, dear. The {{thing that}} annoys {{me is that}} such a woman as that should have even heard my name at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Could we not do much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> to {{make the}} broad issues of various current {{questions}} plain and accessible to our students in the college stage? ...|$|E
60|$|This {{version of}} that strange affair, the {{slaughter}} of the Ruthvens, is taken entirely from the lips of sworn witnesses. We still know no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> as to what passed between the moment when James and the Master, alone, left the dining chamber, and {{the moment when the}} King cried ‘Treason!’ out of the turret window.|$|R
60|$|So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge {{was always}} helped {{immediately}} after me, {{to whom the}} preference was given as a visitor of distinction. The fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> and shed tears again, and made that former declaration with great bitterness.|$|R
60|$|Under all the circumstances, Captain Williams {{determined}} {{to get on the}} weather-quarter of our neighbour, and take a still nearer look at him. That he was armed, we could see already; and, as near as we could make out, he carried twelve guns, or just two <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> ourselves. All this was encouraging; sufficiently so, at least, to induce us to make a much closer examination <b>than</b> <b>we</b> had yet <b>done.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. You'd only {{be in the}} way. Besides, {{you need}} rest <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> Put {{yourself}} in the rocking-chair in the veranda, {{and go to sleep}} until Mr. Bradley comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which means also," [...] {{the queen}} said gently, [...] "in that of my minister, who may need {{faithful}} friends even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and under whose advice {{we have now}} acted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Brown, don't now! She's {{not one of}} us. There's no saying what's {{going on}} there in her. Maybe she's praying; maybe she sees <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> over the sea there." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>More</b> <b>Than</b> aired {{their first}} {{television}} advert without Lucky {{and the new}} slogan <b>More</b> <b>Than</b> - <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R
60|$|Unless in {{the next}} half-hour we could chance upon a saeter, this meant passing the night upon the mountain. Michael and I looked at the guide; but though, with {{characteristic}} Norwegian sturdiness, he put a bold face upon it, we could see that in that deepening darkness he knew no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> Wasting no time on words, we made straight for the nearest point of descent, knowing that any human habitation must be far below us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, comrade, so you {{too have}} gone through it without a scratch," [...] Julian's friend, the sergeant, said to him. [...] "Well, you will never see such a fight again if you grow gray in the service. Where are those who scoffed at the Russians now? They can fight, these men. It was a battle of giants. No one could have <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> and yet they did as much; but to-morrow we shall win." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned to}} me and said, [...] "You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> Which is the way to the chapel?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bet for Betted. The verb to bet forms its preterite regularly, as do wet, wed, knit, {{quit and}} others that are {{commonly}} misconjugated. It seems that we clip our short words <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> our long.|$|E
6000|$|DORA (biting her lip). Well, then, {{tell us what}} {{we ought}} to mean. As if you didn't teach it all to us, and mean it yourself, at this moment, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> if you wouldn't be tiresome! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought we}} could not love each other <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> Plantagenet,' at length she said. 'Do you {{remember}} the jewel that you gave me? I always wore it until you seemed to forget us, and then I thought it looked so foolish! You remember what is inscribed on it: 'TO VENETIA, FROM HER AFFECTIONATE BROTHER, PLANTAGENET.' And as a brother I always loved you; had I indeed been your sister I could not have loved you more warmly and more truly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was terrible, Ulred; {{and though}} the Norsemen {{suffered}} vastly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> {{the ranks of the}} housecarls, on whom the brunt of the fighting fell, have been sorely thinned. We shall feel their loss when we meet the Normans. Against their heavily-armed troops and their squadrons of knights and horsemen one of the Thingmen was worth three untried peasants. Had we but half the number of our foe, and that half all housecarls, I should not for a moment doubt the issue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{see that}} <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> are <b>doing,</b> Tom. <b>We</b> always keep a dozen logs lying round {{the fire to}} dry a bit before they are put on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't {{you make}} {{yourself}} a consumed ass," [...] he said. [...] "You want those dollars considerably <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and we've {{got quite a}} few of them doing nothing in the bank. That is, Larry has." ...|$|E
60|$|We are too comfortable, I think, at times. We {{are so much}} {{accustomed}} to be blest by God, that we take his blessings as matters of course, and feel them no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the air we breathe.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{owner of}} the steam yacht hired him," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Rover. [...] "I believe the captain does not like him any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> But the mate does his duty faithfully, so the captain cannot find fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Prendick," [...] said Montgomery, [...] "you're a silly ass! Come out of {{the water}} and take these revolvers, and talk. <b>We</b> can't <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> could <b>do</b> now." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{went there}} with the very first ship, with the first Governor, Captain Stirling. I had on my staff only one {{assistant}} surveyor, {{and what could be}} done with one assistant, with the whole of the townships to be fixed upon and surveyed, the country to be examined, the settlers located, the harbours to be surveyed, &c. &c.? It was perfectly impossible to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> Everything that could be done was done, but it was insufficient to place the people on their lands in time to prevent their sustaining very great losses."1 ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{laugh at}} the remembrance now--until I recall the real horror of fear that enwrapped us in that sunny orchard that August morning of long ago; and then I laugh no more. We were only children, be it remembered, with a very firm and simple faith that grown people knew much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> and a rooted {{conviction}} that whatever you read in a newspaper must be true. If the Daily Enterprise said that August twelfth {{was to be the}} Judgment Day how were you going to get around it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I watch her," [...] he said. [...] "Women suffer <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> They {{live more}} in the present. I see my hopes, but she--she sees only me, and I {{have always been a}} failure. She has lost faith in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{continued}} Emily, [...] "that most gentlemen become {{acquainted with}} some people {{that they would not}} wish all their friends to know that they knew. They go about so much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and meet people of all sorts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe {{fine young}} ladies enjoy {{themselves}} a bit <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{in spite of}} our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them." [...] And I think Jo was quite right.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know that}} some of you have been waiting for this story of the Tin Woodman, because many of my correspondents have asked me, time and again what ever became of the [...] "pretty Munchkin girl" [...] whom Nick Chopper was engaged to marry before the Wicked Witch enchanted his axe and he traded his flesh for tin. I, too, have {{wondered}} what became of her, but until Woot the Wanderer interested himself in the matter the Tin Woodman knew no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> However, he found her, after many thrilling adventures, as you will discover when you have read this story.|$|R
60|$|The skeletons {{went with}} us {{throughout}} Herculaneum, and descended into the cell, all green with damp, under the basilica, and lay down, fettered and manacled {{in the place}} of those found there beside the big bronze kettle in which the prisoners used to cook their dinners. How ghastly the thought of it was! If we had really seen this kettle and the skeletons there--as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not--we could not have suffered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> They took all the life out of the House of Perseus, and the beauty from his pretty little domestic temple to the Penates, and this was all there was left in Herculaneum to see.|$|R
60|$|JENNY. I've {{been going}} hard since morning. But there's <b>more</b> work <b>than</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do.</b> I mustn't stop.|$|R
