50|$|In a computer, the <b>Memory</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Register</b> (MAR) is the CPU {{register}} {{that either}} stores the memory address from which {{data will be}} fetched to the CPU or the address to which data will be sent and stored.|$|E
5000|$|The chip (limited by its 18-pin DIP packaging) had {{a single}} 8-bit bus and {{required}} {{a significant amount of}} external support logic. For example, the 14-bit address, which could access [...] "16 K × 8 bits of memory", needed to be latched by some of this logic into an external <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register</b> (MAR). The 8008 could access 8 input ports and 24 output ports.|$|E
5000|$|The entire {{core memory}} {{was in the}} IBM 1625 memory unit. Memory cycle time was halved {{compared}} to the Model I's (internal or 1623 memory unit), to 10 µs (i.e., the cycle speed was raised to 100 kHz) by using faster cores. A <b>Memory</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Register</b> Storage (MARS) core memory read, clear, or write operation took 1.5 µs and each write operation was automatically (but not necessarily immediately) preceded by a read or clear operation of the same [...] "register(s)" [...] during the 10 µs memory cycle.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{instructions}} can {{be grouped}} into six categories: accumulator instructions, branch instructions, <b>memory</b> reference instructions, <b>address</b> <b>register</b> instructions, scratchpad register instruction, miscellaneous instructions (interrupt, input, output, indirect scratchpad register, load, and store).|$|R
50|$|Since three-address code {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} language within compilers, the operands will most likely not be concrete <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> or processor <b>registers,</b> but rather symbolic addresses that will be translated into actual <b>addresses</b> during <b>register</b> allocation. It is also not uncommon that operand names are numbered sequentially since three-address code is typically generated by the compiler.|$|R

50|$|Standard DMA, {{also called}} {{third-party}} DMA, uses a DMA controller. A DMA controller can generate memory addresses and initiate memory {{read or write}} cycles. It contains several hardware registers that can be written and read by the CPU. These include a <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register,</b> a byte count register, and one or more control registers. The control registers could specify the source, the destination, {{the direction of the}} transfer (reading from the I/O device or writing to the I/O device), the size of the transfer unit, and/or the number of bytes to transfer in one burst depending on what features the DMA controller provides.|$|E
50|$|A memory buffer {{register}} (MBR) is the register in a computer's processor, or central processing unit, CPU, that stores the data being transferred {{to and from}} the immediate access store. It contains the copy of designated memory locations specified by the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register.</b> It acts as a buffer allowing the processor and memory units to act independently without being affected by minor differences in operation. A data item will be copied to the MBR ready for use at the next clock cycle, when it can be either used by the processor for reading or writing or stored in main memory after being written.|$|E
5000|$|The first 20,000 decimal digits of Magnetic-core memory were {{internal}} to the CPU itself (which {{reduced the}} floor space {{requirements of the}} basic system). Expansion to either 40,000 or 60,000 decimal digits required the addition of an IBM 1623 Memory unit. The memory cycle time was 20μs ( [...] that is, the memory speed was 50kHz = 1/20th of a MHz). A <b>Memory</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Register</b> Storage (MARS) Core memory read, clear, or write operation took 2 μs and each write operation was automatically (but not necessarily immediately) preceded by a read or clear operation of the same [...] "register(s)" [...] during the 20 μs memory cycle.|$|E
50|$|The 8061 had an interruptible-burst-mode 11-wire 8-bit memory {{interface}} bus {{called the}} M-Bus. This bus required a program counter and a data <b>address</b> <b>register</b> in each <b>memory</b> device. Each chip reset or branch instruction would update the program counter {{in the memory}} devices, after which instruction stream data would be read sequentially. The instruction stream could be interrupted to read or write data bytes and words using the <b>memory's</b> data <b>address</b> <b>register</b> while retaining the memory's program counter copy - allowing resumption of reading the instruction stream without having to re-send a program address after each data access.|$|R
50|$|In 12 bits {{the mode}} of {{addressing}} and the <b>address</b> of a <b>register</b> in control memory are identified. Also an increment between 0 and 32 is specified. The main <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> is in the register in control memory. The processor will first obtain the main <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> from the <b>register,</b> then call for the word at that main <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b> Finally it will increase (increment) the register value by the amount specified. The 16 bit <b>address</b> from the <b>register</b> contains a bank address from 0 to 31 using 5 bits and a word in that bank using 11 bits. Incrementing was recommended only for addresses A and B.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 McCormack was {{employed}} by NCR {{right out of}} college, and they had developed a Bit slicing implementation of the p-code machine using the Am2900 chip set. This CPU had a myriad of timing and performance problems so McCormack proposed a total redesign of the processor using a programmable logic device based Microsequencer. McCormack left NCR to start a company called Volition Systems but continued {{the work on the}} CPU as a contractor.The new CPU used an 80-bit wide microword, so parallelism in the microcode was radically enhanced. There were several loopsin the microcode that were a single instruction long and many of the simpler p-code ops took 1 or 2 microcode instructions. With the wide microword and the way the busses were carefully arranged, as well as incrementing <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>registers,</b> the cpu could execute operations inside the ALU while transferring a memory word directly to the onboard stack, or feed one source into the ALU while sending a previously computed register to the destination bus in a single microcycle.|$|R

50|$|For {{performance}} reasons, all {{the parallel}} address lines of an address bus must be valid {{at the same}} time, otherwise access to memory would be delayed and performance would be seriously reduced. Integrated circuit packages may have a limit {{on the number of}} pins available to provide the memory bus. Different versions of a CPU architecture, in different-sized IC packages, can be designed, trading off reduced package size for reduced pin count and address space. A trade-off might be made between address pins and other functions, restricting the memory physically available to an architecture even if it inherently has a higher capacity. On the other hand, segmented or bank switching designs provide more memory address space than is available in an internal <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{may also}} be a <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register</b> and a memory data register, used to access the main {{computer}} storage. Together, these elements form an [...] "execution unit". Most modern CPUs have several execution units. Even simple computers usually have one unit to read and write memory, and another to execute user code. These elements could often be brought together as a single chip. This chip comes in a fixed width that would form a [...] "slice" [...] through the execution unit. These are known as [...] "bit slice" [...] chips. The AMD Am2900 family {{is one of the best}} known examples of bit slice elements. The parts of the execution units and the execution units themselves are interconnected by a bundle of wires called a bus.|$|E

These <b>registers</b> include both user and executive copies of the A, X, R, and J registers and many special function executive registers.|$|R
50|$|Four segment {{registers}} (CS, DS, SS and ES) {{are used}} to form a <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b> The FLAGS <b>register</b> contains flags such as carry flag, overflow flag and zero flag. Finally, the instruction pointer (IP) points to the next instruction that will be fetched from memory and then executed; this register cannot be directly accessed (read or written) by a program.|$|R
5000|$|An {{easy way}} to {{differentiate}} between a hardware C64 and a C128 operating in C64 mode, typically used from within a running program, is to write a value different from [...] to <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> , a <b>register</b> {{which is used to}} decode the extra keys of the C128 (the numerical keypad and some other keys). On the C64 this memory location will always contain the value [...] no matter what is written to it, but on a C128 in C64 mode the value of the location—a memory-mapped register—can be changed. Thus, checking the location's value after writing to it will reveal the actual hardware platform.|$|R
50|$|The person {{designing}} a system usually draws the specific microarchitecture {{as a kind}} of data flow diagram. Like a block diagram, the microarchitecture diagram shows microarchitectural elements such as the arithmetic and logic unit and the register file as a single schematic symbol. Typically, the diagram connects those elements with arrows, thick lines and thin lines to distinguish between three-state buses (which require a three-state buffer for each device that drives the bus), unidirectional buses (always driven by a single source, such as the way the address bus on simpler computers is always driven by the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register),</b> and individual control lines. Very simple computers have a single data bus organization they have a single three-state bus. The diagram of more complex computers usually shows multiple three-state buses, which help the machine do more operations simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{very simple}} systems, {{at various times}} the data bus {{is driven by the}} program memory, by RAM, and by I/O devices.To prevent bus {{contention}} on the data bus, at any one instant only one device drives the data bus.In very simple systems, only the data bus is required to be a bidirectional bus.In very simple systems, the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register</b> always drives the address bus, the control unit always drives the control bus,and an address decoder selects which particular device is allowed to drive the data bus during this bus cycle.In very simple systems, every instruction cycle starts with a READ memory cycle where program memory drives the instruction onto the data bus while the instruction register latches that instruction from the data bus.Some instructions continue with a WRITE memory cycle where the memory data register drives data onto the data bus into the chosen RAM or I/O device.Other instructions continue with another READ memory cycle where the chosen RAM, program memory, or I/O device drives data onto the data bus while the memory data register latches that data from the data bus.|$|E
5000|$|Von Neumann’s {{machine design}} uses a RISC (Reduced {{instruction}} set computing) architecture, {{which means the}} instruction set uses a total of 21 instructions to perform all tasks. (This {{is in contrast to}} CISC, complex instruction set computing, instruction sets which have more instructions from which to choose.) With von Neumann architecture, main memory along with the accumulator (the register that holds the result of logical operations) are the two memories that are addressed. Operations can be carried out as simple arithmetic (these are performed by the ALU and include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), conditional branches (these are more commonly seen now as [...] statements or [...] loops. The branches serve as [...] statements), and logical moves between the different components of the machine, i.e., a move from the accumulator to memory or vice versa. Von Neumann architecture accepts fractions and instructions as data types. Finally, as the von Neumann architecture is a simple one, its register management is also simple. The architecture uses a set of seven registers to manipulate and interpret fetched data and instructions. These registers include the [...] "IR" [...] (instruction register), [...] "IBR" [...] (instruction buffer register), [...] "MQ" [...] (multiplier quotient register), [...] "MAR" [...] (<b>memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register),</b> and [...] "MDR" [...] (memory data register)." [...] The architecture also uses a program counter ("PC") to keep track of where in the program the machine is.|$|E

40|$|Since most DSP {{applications}} access {{large amount}} of data stored in the memory, a DSP code generator must minimize the addressing overhead. In this paper, we propose a method for addressing optimization in loop execution targeted toward DSP processors with autoincrement /decrement feature in their address generation unit.
