Study was performed to identify the most probable cause of the pipes failures. The study conducted by reviewing the existing design and construction data, visual physical inspection, pipe material analysis, structural analysis using NASTRAN and Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis (CFD) using FLUENT. Investigations revealed that high pressure water jet from leaked water pipe had completely mixed with surrounding soil forming water soil slurry (high erosive properties) formed at a close vicinity of these pipes. Continuous impaction of this slurry upon the API 5 L X 42 pipe surface had caused losses of the pipe coating materials. Corrosion quickly ensued and material loss was rapid because of the continuous erosion of oxidised material that occurred simultaneously. This phenomenon explains the rapid thinning of the steel pipe body which later led to its <b>failure.</b> <b>Metallurgical</b> study using photomicrograph shows that the morphology of the steel material was consistent and did not show any evidence of internal corrosion or micro fractures.

40|$|The atomic {{diffusion}} mechanisms {{associated with}} <b>metallurgical</b> <b>failure</b> of TaRhx diffusion barriers for Cu metallizations were studied by in situ {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). The issues related to in situ heating of focused ion beam (FIB) prepared cross-sectional TEM samples that contain Cu thin films are discussed. The Cu layer in Si/(13 nm) TaRhx /Cu stacks showed grain growth and formation of voids at temperatures exceeding 550 0 C. For Si/(43 nm) TaRhx /Cu stacks, grain growth of Cu was delayed to higher temperatures, i. e., 700 0 C, and void formation was not observed. Extensive surface diffusion of Cu, however, preceded bulk diffusion. Therefore, a 10 nm film of electron beam evaporated C was deposited {{on both sides of}} the TEM lamellae to limit surface diffusion. This processing technique allowed for direct observation of atomic diffusion and reaction mechanisms across the TaRhx interface. Failure occurred by nucleation of orthorhombic RhSi particles at the Si/TaRhx interface. Subsequently, the barrier at areas adjacent to RhSi particles was depleted in Rh. This created lower density areas in the barrier, which facilitated diffusion of Cu to the Si substrate to form Cu 3 Si. The morphology of an in situ annealed lamella was compared with an ex situ bulk annealed sample, which showed similar reaction morphology. The sample preparation method developed in this study successfully prevented surface diffusion/delamination of the Cu layer and can be employed to understand the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>failure</b> of other potential diffusion barriers. 9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: Failure {{mechanisms}} {{contributed by}} stress or material fatigue have been witnessed in several industrial {{as well as}} at R&D applications in various forms. <b>Metallurgical</b> studies for <b>failure</b> analysis have ensured the contributions of residual stress in several cases. The most important and common consideration in all these cases has been the material. Definitely, there may be other contributing factors also like sudden load, operating temperature, lack of lubrication etc. The most vital aspect of all the scientific observations remains to search the accurate cause with parameters & the subsequent measures for remedy. Here, lies a very close & important relation between Condition Monitoring activities & Failure analysis studies. While mainly metallurgical engineering which includes in-depth study of microstructure, grain boundaries etc. dominates the field of failure analysis, on the other hand a combination of various streams starting from instrumentation to mechanical, which again includes lubric ant analysis, vibration based signature analysis, sophisticated systems like digital image correlation constitute the domain of Condition Monitoring. But it must be acknowledged that failure analysis studies pave the way for Condition Monitoring activities, since it indicates the parameters that are needed to be monitored & controlled. Hence, failure analysis strengthens the condition monitoring initiatives. However, this paper mainly highlights upon the various causes and features of material fatigue or fatigue failure, their occurrence at industrial sectors and the subsequent experimental procedures for stress-strain measurement in R&D...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 61 - 68 Open bladed {{impellers}} (impellers without shrouds) {{with high}} rotational speeds are a vital component of centrifugal compressors. The impeller reliability {{is directly related}} to the compressors? successful operation and environmental safety. Assuming that the impeller is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of impeller failure is fatigue. There are primarily two types of fatigue failures: blade failures and disk <b>failures.</b> <b>Metallurgical</b> inspection of failed impellers can be used to identify fatigue as the root cause. It is imperative, however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in impeller failures. To meet the objective of designing reliable and trouble-free impellers, blade and disk modal analyses are of the utmost importance. Development of a Campbell diagram is a typical means of identifying potential harmonic frequencies. The blade frequencies and disk frequencies overlap each other on the Campbell diagram because of the complex blade geometry and influence of disk flexibility. This makes it difficult to identify the possible resonance. This paper describes a practical method, which combines 3 -D finite element modal analysis, Campbell diagram, Singh?s advanced frequency evaluation (SAFE) diagram, and the authors? experience in an effort to prevent excitation of undesirable natural frequencies. Presented within the paper are particular modal analysis steps, which include: ?	Techniques to identify possible disk resonance ?	Techniques to identify possible blade and bladed disk resonance ?	Techniques to improve the design The method has been successfully used in centrifugal compressor impeller design process and failure cause analyses.

40|$|Hardness, Strength and Ductility are {{the most}} {{important}} material physical properties which are interrelated. Generally, hardness can be readily measured and it is directly proportional to Strength and inversely to the Ductility.

It is well understood that hardness measurement / verification plays a vital role, not only during the normal Quality Control (QC) checks but more importantly during <b>metallurgical</b> <b>failure</b> investigation process, as hardness virtually speaks a lot about material properties. The very first scientific attempt in hardness measurements was comparing the object hardness against a set of selected stones with varied surface hardness. Currently, there are several established techniques to assess metal hardness both in laboratories and in the field, and also in both micro and macro ranges. The hardness is measured in several different Units, characteristic to each measuring technique, and hence, no single unit can be universally adopted.

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of hydrogen embrittlement failure of subsea bolts operating under CP are surface cracks at thread and shank area {{and for some}} cases they are completely ruptured from the shank area. The <b>metallurgical</b> reason for <b>failure</b> already reported by researchers (including for Inconel 718) was the interaction of hydrogen atoms with grain boundary precipitates (Ni 3 Nb Î´) resulting in hydrogen assisted intergranular cracking. Inconel 718 was received as rectangular block (RB) and bolts (Î¦ 28 mm). They were heat treated as per API 6 A 718 specifications. The yield strength and vickers hardness found for API aged RB specimen S 2 API was 840 MPa and 340 HV respectively. On the other hand API bolt was found with bulk yield strength of 880 MPa and vickers hardness in the range 370 - 400 HV (bulk to edge of the bolt). The structure of bolt (bulk, shank and thread) and rectangular block was investigated, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to understand {{the reason for this}} difference. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions. The microstructure of the API bolt shows no evidence of intergranular (Ni 3 Nb Î´) precipitates and the nano-structure revealed Î³â€™ and Ni 3 Nb Î³â€™â€™ precipitates. This suggest that for Inconel 718 in the form of bolts the theory of intergranular cracking hydrogen enhanced de-cohesion at the grain boundary matrix precipitate interfaces is not specifically relevant instead the transgranular oversized Î³â€™ precipitates (50 nm Î³â€™ at thread edge of the bolt) and the elongated metastable Î³â€™â€™ discs (50 - 100 nm at shank and thread edge of the bolt) could act as initiation point for HEDE. Moreover, it was also found that threading of the bolt (after heat treatment) results in shearing of Î³â€™ precipitates at threads edge. These sheared Î³â€™ precipitates could aid in trapping hydrogen atoms under CP in service leading to HEDE. The newly developed bolting materials Incoloy 945 and its higher strength version 945 x (as rectangular and cylindrical blocks) were added for structural investigation because of lower content of Nb present in their matrix than 718. Finally, as future work, the structure of 718, 945 and 945 x alloys were selected for assessing susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement using slow strain rate testing under CP...|$|R
