25|$|Peggy Caserta {{claimed in}} her book, Going Down With Janis (1973), {{that she and}} Joplin had decided {{mutually}} in April 1970 {{to stay away from}} each other to avoid enabling each other's drug use. Caserta, a former Delta Air Lines stewardess and owner of one of the first clothing boutiques in the Haight Ashbury, said that by September 1970, she was smuggling cannabis throughout California and had checked into the Landmark <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotel</b> because it attracted drug users.|$|E
25|$|Joplin {{checked into}} the Landmark <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotel</b> in Hollywood on August 24, 1970, near Sunset Sound Recorders, where she began rehearsing and {{recording}} her album. During the sessions, Joplin continued a relationship with Seth Morgan, a 21-year-old UC Berkeley student, cocaine dealer, and future novelist who had visited her new home in Larkspur in July and August. She and Morgan were {{engaged to be married}} in early September, even though he visited Sunset Sound Recorders for just eight of Joplin's many rehearsals and sessions.|$|E

50|$|The Danish hotels {{were sold}} {{as well in}} the seventies, in 1974 Lego bought the hotel in Billund {{renaming}} it in Vis-a-Vis Hotel and later on Hotel Legoland. In 1979 the Glostrup hotel changed to Glostrup Park Hotel. Meanwhile, the expansion in Sweden and Norway continued from 28 in Sweden in 1974 to 44 in October 1976. Besides the Esso <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotels</b> the chain created parallel markets of hotels, without motorist services, in cities branded as Esso Scandic and Esso Motels, such as Örkelljunga and Vara, with minimized services. Esso also operated roadside restaurants branded as Taverna. In 1977 Esso <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotels</b> owned 10% of the hotelcapacity in Sweden but had a 25% marketshare. In 1983 Esso decided to leave the hotel business. At that time 41 Esso <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotels,</b> 8 Esso Scandic Hotels and 6 Esso Motels were operated in Sweden. The locations in Sweden and Norway were sold to a group of investors. After the detachment from the Esso-company in 1984 the Hotel-chain changed its name in Scandic Hotels.|$|R
25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin {{failed to show}} up at Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke drove to the Landmark <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotel</b> in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead on the floor beside her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
2500|$|According to Caserta's book Going Down With Janis, Joplin {{introduced}} her to Seth Morgan in Joplin's room at the Landmark <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotel</b> on Tuesday night, September 29, 1970. [...] Caserta [...] "had seen him around" [...] San Francisco but had not met him before. [...] All three of them agreed to reunite three nights later, on Friday night, for a ménage à trois in Joplin's room. Caserta saw Joplin briefly the next day, Wednesday, again in Joplin's room, when Caserta accommodated her new Los Angeles friend Debbie Nuciforo, age 19, an aspiring hard rock drummer who wanted to meet Joplin. Nuciforo was stoned on heroin at the time, and the three women's encounter was brief and unpleasant.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{original}} plan was more modest in scope, involving light industrial buildings with a <b>motor</b> <b>hotel</b> along Tresser Blvd. and an open-air shopping promenade planned for East Main Street, {{the city and the}} redeveloper took advantage of an opportunity to capitalize on corporate moves out of NYC. [...] Although One Landmark Square was completed in 1972, a 300,00 SF office building which for 37 years was the city's tallest, it was the completion of the GTE World Headquarters in 1973 that became the catalyst for downtown office development, setting [...] an example for other corporations seeking a less expensive labor pool, a more favorable income tax structure and lower operating costs. [...] Since then, the downtown renewal area has seen the construction of more than 8 million SF of office space, 1.5 million SF of retail space including the Stamford Town Center Mall and four department stores, 2,500 units of housing, near 80 restaurants have been added, three movie theaters, a branch of the University of CT and two performing arts venues, the Rich Forum and the Palace Theater. [...] In all the city contains almost 17 million SF of office space. [...] The intensely developed central business district is just 3 percent of the city's the rest is heavily residential. Much of the city, especially in North Stamford, remained woodsy.|$|E

Mr. Isbell, like his contemporary, Kemmons Wilson, {{the founder of the}} Holiday Inn hotel chain, devised the idea of building and operating a chain of roadside <b>motor</b> <b>hotels</b> while he was on a cross-country trip with his wife, Ingrid, and their three children. On that trip, Isbell noted the substandard quality of roadside motor courts along US highways at the time. He saw the possibility in the developing market for a chain of roadside <b>motor</b> <b>hotels</b> conveniently located along major highways which would provide lodgings with hotel-like quality at near-motel rates plus amenities such as TV, air conditioning, swimming pools, and on-premises restaurants.|$|R

50|$|The 1950s and 1960s was the {{pinnacle}} of the motel industry in the United States and Canada. As older mom-and-pop <b>motor</b> <b>hotels</b> began adding newer amenities such as swimming pools or color TV (a luxury in the 1960s), motels were built in wild and impressive designs. In-room gimmicks such as the coin-operated Magic Fingers vibrating bed were briefly popular; introduced in 1958, these were largely removed in the 1970s due to vandalism of the coin boxes. The American Hotel Association (which had briefly offered a Universal Credit Card in 1953 as forerunner to the modern American Express card) became the American Hotel & Motel Association in 1963.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the first}} three <b>motor</b> <b>hotels</b> in Sweden {{expansion}} abroad followed in 1965. The Scandinavian holidaymaker {{should be able to}} drive to the Italian coast using Esso <b>Motor</b> <b>Hotels</b> during the journey. The Hotels were situated in a one-day driving distance from each other. The northern end of this [...] "Esso route" [...] was Mölndal in Sweden which opened in 1966, the southern end was Brescia in Italy which opened in 1965. The Swedish-Danish bordercrossing was made by ferry at Helsingborg, from Denmark to Germany the route followed the, then new, Vogelfluglinie. In Germany the HaFraBa autobahn route was chosen and south of Basle the route of the present E25 through Switzerland, France and the new Mont Blanc Tunnel. In Italy Brescia was reached through Valle d'Aosta and the Autostrada Serenissima. The intermediate hotels were situated in Hannover, Courmayeur, Freiburg and Glostrup (Copenhagen). From Brescia the tourists could follow their way to the various resorts on the Adriatic in Italy as well as in Yugoslavia. More differentiation was created in 1967 by two more Hotels, Heidelberg and Sindelfingen in the south of Germany. In Sweden the hotels at Nörrköping and Jönköping were opened in 1967 too. These two enabled the travellers from and to Stockholm to follow the direct route from Stockholm to Helsingborg instead of the longer one via Laxå and Mölndal. In 1969 the southern end shifted to Florence, but Esso's Italian partner Pavesi built five hotels between Florence and Sicily. From the initial plan for the route from Trondheim in the North to Sicily in the South only the hotel in Trondheim was added afterwards.|$|R
