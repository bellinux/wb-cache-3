40|$|LL- 37 is a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>component</b> of innate immunity, with a membrane-directed {{antimicrobial}} {{activity and}} receptor-mediated pleiotropic effects on host cells. Sequence variations in its primate orthologues suggest {{two types of}} functional features have evolved; human LL- 37 -like peptides form amphipathic helical structures and self-assemble under physiological conditions, while rhesus RL- 37 -like ones only adopt this structure {{in the presence of}} bacterial membranes. The first type of peptide has a lower and more medium-sensitive antimicrobial activity than the second, but an increased capacity to stimulate host cells. Oligomerization strongly affects the mode of interaction with biological membranes and consequently both cytotoxicity and receptor-mediated activities. In this work we explored the effects of LL- 37 self-association by using obligate, disulfide-linked dimers with either parallel or anti-parallel orientations. These had an increased propensity to form stacked helices in bulk-solution and when in contact with either anionic or neutral model membranes. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the cytotoxic effects on host cells, strongly depended on the type of dimerization.

It forms a ternary complex with actin and spectrin, which defines the nodal {{junctions}} of the membrane-skeletal network, and its attachment to the transmembrane protein glycophorin C creates {{a bridge between the}} protein network and the membrane bilayer. We now show that deletion of 4. 1 R in mouse red cells leads to a large diminution of actin accompanied by extensive loss of cytoskeletal lattice structure, with formation of bare areas of membrane. Whereas band 3, the preponderant transmembrane constituent, and proteins known to be associated with it are present in normal or increased amounts, glycophorin C is missing and XK, Duffy, and Rh are much reduced in the 4. 1 R-deficient cells. The inference that these are associated with 4. 1 R was borne out by the results of in vitro pull-down assays. Furthermore, whereas Western blot analysis showed normal levels of band 3 and Kell, flow cytometric analysis using an antibody against the extracellular region of band 3 or Kell revealed reduction of these two proteins, suggesting a conformational change of band 3 and Kell epitopes. Taken together, we suggest that 4. 1 R organizes a macromolecular complex of skeletal and transmembrane proteins at the junctional node and that perturbation of this macromolecular complex not only is responsible for the well characterized membrane instability but may also remodel the red cell surface...|$|E

The FTIR spectra indicated strong interaction of agar O-H and 3. 6 -anhydro-galactose C-O groups with glycerol and europium picrate. The DSC analyses revealed no glass transition temperature of the samples in the - 60 to 250 degrees C range.

40|$|Pathogenic {{strains of}} Helicobacter pylori use a type IV {{secretion}} system (T 4 SS) {{to deliver the}} toxin CagA into human host cells. The T 4 SS, along with the toxin itself, is coded into a genomic insert, which is termed the cag pathogenicity island. The cag pathogenicity island contains about 30 open-reading frames, for most of which the exact function is not well characterized or totally unknown. We have determined the crystal structure {{of one of the}} proteins coded by the cag genes, CagD, in two crystal forms. We show that the protein is a covalent dimer in which each monomer folds as a single domain that is composed of five beta-strands and three alpha-helices. Our data show that in addition to a cytosolic pool, CagD partially associates with the inner membrane, where it may be exposed to the periplasmic space. Furthermore, CagA tyrosine phosphorylation and interleukin- 8 assays identified CagD as a crucial component of the T 4 SS that is involved in CagA translocation into host epithelial cells; however, it does not seem absolutely necessary for pilus assembly. We have also identified significant amounts of CagD in culture supernatants, which are not a result of general bacterial lysis. Since this localization was independent of the various tested cag mutants, our findings may indicate that CagD is released into the supernatant during host cell infection and then binds to the host cell surface or is incorporated in the pilus structure. Overall, our results suggest that CagD may serve as a unique <b>multifunctional</b> <b>component</b> of the T 4 SS that may be involved in CagA secretion at the inner membrane and may localize outside the bacteria to promote additional effects on the host cell...|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} of {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) {{is crucial for}} calcium (Ca 2 +) homeostasis. STIM 1 and STIM 2 are type I membrane proteins of the ER and function as Ca 2 + sensors in {{a process known as}} store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). They sense a drop in luminal Ca 2 + concentration and undergo conformational changes and oligomerization. The active oligomerized STIM proteins translocate to ER-PM contact sites, where they bind to phosphoinositides (PIPs) at the inner leaflet of the PM via their lysine (K) - rich domains and activate Orai 1, a pore-forming Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAC) channel subunit in the PM. I found that STIM 2, but not STIM 1, contains a di-lysine ER-retention signal. This signal restricts the function of STIM 2 as Ca 2 + sensor to the ER while STIM 1 can reach the PM via the classical secretary pathway. The intracellular distribution of STIM 1 is regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner with cell surface expression of STIM 1 during mitosis. Efficient retention of STIM 1 in the ER during interphase depends on its K-rich domain and a di-arginine ER retention signal. SOCE enhances ER retention, suggesting that trafficking of STIM 1 is regulated and this regulation contributes to STIM 1 ’s role as <b>multifunctional</b> <b>component</b> in Ca 2 +-signaling. In contrast to mitotic cells, interphase cells retain most of their STIM 1 intracellularly. Under resting condition, the ER-resident STIMs are preferentially located in PI(4, 5) P 2 containing preexisting ER-PM contact sites, which are expanded upon ER Ca 2 + depletion. The lipid-binding, K-rich domains are required to localize STIM proteins in preexisting ERPM contact sites. Moreover, STIM 2 recruits ER more efficiently to the PM. This is consistent with the fact that STIM 2 has higher lipid-binding affinity and lower activation threshold than STIM 1 and that STIM 2 functions as a regulator of basal Ca 2 + homeostasis. Finally, I studied the role of microtubules in ER-PM contact site formation. I observed that STIM 1 aligns along microtubules. Alignment of STIM proteins with microtubules is a conserved process. In addition to accumulation of STIM 1 at microtubule plus ends, STIM 1 moves along microtubules in an EB- 1 -independent manner. I identified two EB- 1 - independent microtubule-binding sites located within the C-terminus of STIM 1 and found that oligomerization increases the EB- 1 -independent microtubule-binding affinity of STIM 1. However, the physiological function of this EB 1 -independent microtubule binding activity remains elusive...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{conventional}} {{types of}} hinges for in-space deployment applications. The first type is mechanically deploying hinges. A typical mechanically deploying hinge is usually composed of several tens of components. It is complicated, heavy, and bulky. More components imply higher deployment failure probability. Due {{to the existence}} of relatively moving components among a mechanically deploying hinge, it unavoidably has microdynamic problems. The second type of conventional hinge relies on strain energy for deployment. A tape-spring hinge is a typical strain energy hinge. A fundamental problem of a strain energy hinge is that its deployment dynamic is uncontrollable. Usually, its deployment is associated with a large impact, which is unacceptable for many space applications. Some damping technologies have been experimented with to reduce the impact, but they increased the risks of an unsuccessful deployment. Coalescing strain energy components with shape memory composite (SMC) components to form a hybrid hinge is the solution. SMCs are well suited for deployable structures. A SMC is created from a high-performance fiber and a shape memory polymer resin. When the resin is heated to above its glass transition temperature, the composite becomes flexible and can be folded or packed. Once cooled to below the glass transition temperature, the composite remains in the packed state. When the structure is ready to be deployed, the SMC component is reheated to above the glass transition temperature, and it returns to its as-fabricated shape. A hybrid hinge is composed of two strain energy flanges (also called tape-springs) and one SMC tube. Two folding lines are placed on the SMC tube to avoid excessive strain on the SMC during folding. Two adapters are used to connect the hybrid hinge to its adjacent structural components. While the SMC tube is heated to above its glass transition temperature, a hybrid hinge can be folded and stays at folded status after the temperature is reduced to below its glass transition temperature. After the deployable structure is launched in space, the SMC tube is reheated and the hinge is unfolded to deploy the structure. Based on test results, the hybrid hinge can achieve higher than 99. 999 % shape recovery. The hybrid hinge inherits all of the good characteristics of a tape-spring hinge such as simplicity, light weight, high deployment reliability, and high deployment precision. Conversely, it eliminates the deployment impact that has significantly limited the applications of a tape-spring hinge. The deployment dynamics of a hybrid hinge are in a slow and controllable fashion. The SMC tube of a hybrid hinge is a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>component.</b> It serves as a deployment mechanism during the deployment process, and also serves as a structural component after the hinge is fully deployed, which makes a hybrid hinge much stronger and stiffer than a tape-spring hinge. Unlike a mechanically deploying hinge that uses relatively moving components, a hybrid hinge depends on material deformation for its packing and deployment. It naturally eliminates the microdynamic phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focuses on the technological and operational aspects of low temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) Stacks. The PEMFC is regarded as an ideal replacement to the internal combustion engine, but is still not an economically attractive prime-mover due {{to a number of}} key challenges that have yet to be fully resolved. These challenges include; degradation of cell components resulting in inadequate lifetimes, specialised and costly manufacturing processes and poor gravimetric/volumetric energy densities. The design of a novel modular fuel cell stack is presented which attempts to resolve some of the issues relating to material selection and the manufacturing processes required to produce components of the stack. The bi-polar plate (BPP) is a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>component</b> and is responsible for a considerable proportion of stack weight, size and cost in traditional planar PEMFC stacks. The manufacturing processes associated with BPP are costly and often require specialised machining. The design concept removes the conventional BPP from the stack architecture which improves the volumetric and gravimetric energy density of the stack while considerably reducing the cost of the stack. The new architecture comprises of active and passive zones which have focused on specific functionality originally fulfilled by a planar BPP. Active zones are regions that are in direct contact with the membrane electrode assembly and comprise of components that must have both chemical stability and electrical conductivity. Passive regions are designed for gas distribution and structural rigidity of the stack. The architecture involves a series of integrated chambers that supply a single gaseous stock to two cells simultaneously, which are coupled with external manifolds. Electrical continuity is achieved by utilising mono-polar plates that are connected external to the fuel cell stack. A six cell short stack was designed and assembled and the performance of the stack was experimentally tested. Experimental characterisation of the novel stack produced encouraging results. The stack recorded a maximum electrical output of 232. 4 W and operated over a wide range of operating conditions, including both steady state and dynamic load sequences. Another design feature is the incorporation of a Fault Tolerant System (FTS) {{as a result of the}} electrical connections being made external to the fuel cell stack, thus in the event of a cell failure the cell can be made redundant and the stack continues to operate. The FTS was found to operate as envisaged and continued to produce a steady stack output of 3. 6 V thereafter under this setting. Inspection of the current collecting plates demonstrated degradation on the TiN coating used, with loss of TiN and surface oxidation seen on the coating surface. The severity of the degradation indicated that the TiN coating technique was not suitable for the application. The estimated cost of the stack based on 10, 000, 000 item quantities was approximately $ 10. 83, while the total weight of the stack was measured to be 2. 26 kg, resulting in a gravimetric power density of 101 W/kg. Significant further weight and cost savings are planned as part of a continual design process. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Raffinose series {{oligosaccharides}} (RFOs= α- 1, 6 -galaktosyln-sach; 1 ≤ n < c. 7) {{represent a}} prominent part of soluble saccharide content in mature conifer seeds. RFOs {{are considered to}} act as the <b>multifunctional</b> <b>components</b> in plants, but their precise functions in specific physiological processes remain contentious. The present study focuses on the metabolism and role of RFOs in somatic embryogenesis in two conifer species- Picea abies and hybrid fir (Abies alba x numidica). Three basic approaches were set for achieving spruce somatic embryos (SE) with diverse levels of RFOs: a) culture cultivation with exogenous RFOs, b) culture cultivation with precursors of RFOs synthesis and the last 3) culture exposition to variegated postmaturation treatments inducing RFOs synthesis (desiccation/cold stress). Parallel combinations of stresses led to the highest RFOs levels in SE. These findings associate the RFOs levels in spruce SE with protective function within desiccation state. The final levels of RFOs in the spruce SE were also regulated by endogenous levels of myo-inositol. RFOs were rapidly degraded by SE within early phases of germination independently of the initial level of RFOs. No dramatic decrease in embryo germination was found in embryos with decreased RFOs degradation achieved by treatment [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes the {{integration}} of pulsed photonic sintering into multi-material additive manufacturing processes {{in order to produce}} <b>multifunctional</b> <b>components</b> that would be nearly impossible to produce any other way. Pulsed photonic curing uses high power Xenon flash lamps to thermally fuse printed nanomaterials such as conductive metal inks. To determine the feasibility of the proposed integration, three different polymer additive manufacturing materials were exposed to typical flash curing conditions using a Novacentrix Pulseforge 3300 system. FTIR analysis revealed virtually no change in the polymer substrates, thus indicating that the curing energy did not damage the polymer. Next, copper traces were printed on the same substrate, dried, and photonically cured to establish the feasibility of thermally fusing copper metal on the polymer additive manufacturing substrates. Although drying defects were observed, electrical resistivity values ranging from 0. 081 to 0. 103 Ω/sq. indicated that high temperature and easily oxidized metals can be successfully printed and cured on several commonly used polymer additive manufacturing materials. These results indicate that pulsed photonic curing holds tremendous promise as an enabling technology for next generation multi- material additive manufacturing processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{renovation}} of old buildings {{is actually the}} challenge to cope with increased effort {{in order to reduce}} climate global change, channeling more investment and awareness in this sense, defining more experimentations and find innovative solutions. The difficulty of carrying out an intervention on the existing buildings necessarily arise from the lack of information on the existing structure and the lack of coordinated processes between the multidisciplinary skills involved, as well as a difficulty to optimize the process that would make it even more competitive on the renovation work instead on the new construction. Naturwall is an innovative energy saving system for existent buildings by using wood in <b>multifunctional</b> <b>components</b> able to mitigate the environmental effort in building management. The project meant to introduce an industrialized design method in the {{renovation of}} existing build environment that highlights opportunities gave by "off site" production and parametric design approach, without neglecting the aesthetical values and the possibility to change the architectural image of residential and non residential constructions. The project aims to create a representative model of solution that will be promoted in Italy and widespread in other similar contex...|$|R
