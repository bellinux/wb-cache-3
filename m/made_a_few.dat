The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling {{for an end to}} military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> abortive moves to remove him from power.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E

5|$|After {{training}} with Johnny Rodz, Kaye {{began working on}} the American independent circuit. While working full-time as a teacher in 2004, he continued to wrestle during his vacation time and weekends, while also using sick days. On December 16, 2004, Striker began a tour of Japan with Pro Wrestling Zero1 and was later invited back for an extended tour in early 2005. After resigning from his teaching position, he continued to wrestle around New York, and on April 30, 2005, won the New York Wrestling Connection (NYWC)'s Heavyweight Championship by defeating Mike Mondo. A few weeks later, on May 21, while still the Heavyweight Champion, he defeated Joey Braggiol to win the NYWC Interstate Championship, but only held the championship for two weeks, before losing it back to Braggiol on June 4. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> appearances for Ring of Honor in mid-2005, before returning to NYWC to lose the Heavyweight Championship to Jerry Lynn on July 30, after holding it for four months. He continued to wrestle for independent promotions throughout mid-2005, until he {{signed a contract with}} WWE.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E

5|$|In December 1959, Manekshaw was {{appointed}} the commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. Soon, {{he was in}} middle of an unwanted controversy that almost ended his career. In May 1961, Thimayya resigned as the COAS, and was succeeded by General Pran Nath Thapar. Earlier in the year, Major General Brij Mohan Kaul was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon against the recommendation of Thimayya. This incident had led to Thimayya's resignation. Within no time, Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul soon became close to Nehru and Menon, and even {{more powerful than the}} chief himself. This was not liked by senior army officials, including Manekshaw. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> derogatory comments on the political leadership, which led him to be marked as an anti-national.|$|E
5|$|King Louis IX of France bought what he {{believed}} to be the authentic Crown of Thorns in Constantinople in 1239, and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings. John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416), brother of King Charles V of France, had this reliquary made to house a single thorn; it was probably <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years before he commissioned his famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, and some years after he commissioned the Royal Gold Cup, also in the British Museum. Previously dated between 1401 and 1410, from evidence in John Cherry's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought to have been made before 1397; based on the heraldic forms used, the museum now dates it to 1390–97. The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of Louis I, Duke of Orléans, but all recent writers prefer his brother, the Duke of Berry.|$|E

Newman—commander of the 1st Brigade—to {{place the}} 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, in the {{northern}} portion of Long Nguyen. On the next day, Colonel Frank E. Blazey, commander of the 3rd Brigade, was ordered to deploy the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to the southern half of the area. In {{the early stages of}} Shenandoah II, U.S. forces only <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> contacts with the Viet Cong. On October 2, a South Vietnamese unit operating east of Highway 13 near Chon Thanh made significant contact with a large Viet Cong formation and absorbed heavy casualties. Enemy documents obtained by the South Vietnamese indicated they had clashed with a battalion-sized unit from the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment, sent to attack Chon Thanh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area. Early in October, Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment had arrived in Long Nguyen but they could not obtain their much-needed food supplies, as a result of allied search-and-destroy operations which had created significant food shortages for Viet Cong units in the region.|$|E
