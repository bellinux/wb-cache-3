40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] and Kraincanic recently developed two somewhat different theoretical models for analysing large-diameter wire ropes with either an independent wire <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> (IWRC) or a fibre core. Most importantly, unlike all of the previously available theories (with their often very lengthy mathematical formulations), very encouraging correlations have been found between Raoof and Kraincanic's theoretical predictions of wire rope axial stiffnesses and a fairly large body of experimental data from other sources, hence providing ample support for the reliability of both theoretical models. Raoof and Kraincanic's original models were, however, computer based and involved certain iterative procedures. This potential drawback for practical applications (in an area where, by tradition, {{the rule of thumb}} reigns supreme) is overcome in the present paper, which reports details of some simplified (but still accurate) procedures for predicting the no-slip and/or full-slip axial stiffnesses of wire ropes with either an independent wire <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> or a fibre core, with the proposed formulations being amenable to simple hand calculations using a pocket calculator, which is of value to busy practising engineers...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{manufacturer}} {{the basic}} principle of operation is the same. The cable has its outer layers {{wrapped around a}} metal cone, with the <b>rope's</b> <b>core</b> running {{through a hole in}} the middle of the cone. The assembly sits inside a conical outer body. When the cable is in tension, the action is such that the cone and wire are drawn further into the conical bore of the outer body resulting in a large reaction load. This load grips the wire and prevents further movement.|$|R

50|$|Prusiks are {{far less}} likely to damage the <b>main</b> <b>rope</b> than {{mechanical}} rope-grabs such as a jumar. A prusik which is overloaded will initially slip, causing no damage. If loaded to great excess, the worst result is that it slides until the heat of friction causes physical failure of the prusik cord, rather than the rope. Mechanical rope-grabs when overloaded will sometimes damage the sheath of the rope, or in extreme cases sever the rope entirely.|$|R

Sisal has been utilized as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre {{is used in the}} cordage industry for making ropes, baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} for a cable puller to clarify the friction mechanism between a wire rope and steel grippers. In earlier works, some fundamental data such as friction coefficient, deformation and real contact area were obtained. This paper presents main factors affecting the friction based on the experiment varying apparent contact area and lubricants, and also observation of the deformation process. It is shown that the friction of the wire rope is hardly affected by the apparent contact area but significantly affected by the section shape of grippers. It is considered that high compressive load being mainly supported by 6 strands, rather than the <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> of a wire rope structure, is closely related to the friction mechanism...|$|R

The discontinuity orientations, the size determined by time of passage, and the magnetic cloud signature are fit into the topology of a flux rope loop distorted by expansion into a thick rope with comparable dimensions in both the ecliptic and meridional planes. The looped rope fills a bubblelike cavity, thus preserving both types of proposed coronal mass ejection geometries. Other interesting features of the data include an apparent separation by the <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> of bidirectionally streaming protons in the leading section from electrons in the trailing section, possible vortical flow within the magnetic cloud, and a well-defined filamentary structure behind the shock...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of magnetic flux ropes observed by the four Cluster spacecraft during periods of magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a list of 21 Cluster encounters with the reconnection process in the period 2001 – 2006 identified in Borg et al. (2012), we present the distribution and characteristics of the flux ropes. We find 27 flux ropes embedded in the reconnection outflows of only 11 of the 21 reconnection encounters. Reconnection processes associated with no flux rope observations were not distinguishable from those where flux ropes were observed. Only 7 of the 27 flux ropes show evidence of enhanced energetic electron flux above 50 keV, {{and there was no}} clear signature of the flux rope in the thermal particle measurements.

40|$|This paper {{primarily}} {{examines the}} key factors {{being involved in}} precisely determining {{the sign of the}} core field in a magnetic flux rope (MFR) like structure embedded in the tailward plasma flow associated with the Earth's magnetotail. Magnetic flux ropes are frequently detected by satellites moving smoothly northwards (upwards) or southwards (downwards) and crossing almost the whole plasma sheet; the sign of the <b>rope's</b> <b>core</b> is associated with the local tail's motion: If the tail is bending to an upward or downward direction, then the sign of the <b>rope's</b> <b>core,</b> being essentially an intense By deviation, will be positive or negative correspondingly. On the basis of this observational finding, a major question concerns the mechanism by which the tail's motion is dictated. The reconnection process acting in the tail will obviously produce symmetric structures of MFRs (with respect to the neutral sheet plane); therefore, the detected organized asymmetry may be an additional indication in the whole magnetotail' s dynamics. Moreover, we discuss the issue of the core's sign in cases without any significant magnetotail's motion. A model interpreting the diagnosed behavior is introduced: Once a tailward ion jet is produced in a thinned plasma sheet, it might form clockwise or counterclockwise ion vortices (i. e., loop-like ion currents) providing the "magnetic core" with the appropriate sign. The crucial role of the interplanetary By deviation of the magnetic field (IMF) is scrutinized and taken into account. The whole model is tested under the condition of long-lasting extraordinary events characterized by a persistent-intense By deviation with a duration up to 34 min. This work, based on Geotail single-satellite measurements, is not a statistical one; it is a first approach allowing the reconstruction of measurements in the whole range of the magnetotail's deflections, from negligible up to stronger significant magnetotail movements, and should be therefore elucidated in more detail. The average duration for the studied ropes is 90 sec; they occur at distances greater than 25 RE from the Earth...|$|R

50|$|Single, double, and twin rope are {{the three}} <b>main</b> <b>rope</b> systems used in ice climbing. The single rope system, which is suited for {{straight}} climbing routes, is {{the most commonly used}} rock climbing system in the world. Also often used in climbing is the double rope system which is a more flexible system than the single rope system. Lastly, the twin rope system, which uses two twin ropes in a single rope system, is used for longer multi-pitch routes. Double and twin rope technique is used more frequently in ice climbing because these systems are more redundant, an important consideration given the number of sharp edges the ice climber carries with him. Impact force on ice is an issue, with double ropes gaining popularity over twins.|$|R

The friction mechanism of a wire rope under a large deformation due to high grasp force, however, has not been sufficiently clarified.

This report provides a generalized mathematical model that completely describes the geometry of the wires. It consists of two sets of vector equations and is valid for any round-strand wire rope. One set of equations is used to trace the paths of wires that have {{the form of a}} single helix; the other is used for the paths of double helical wires.

The paths and the geometric properties of the wires, which include the path length per lay of strand, the curvature, and the torsion, were determined from this model.
