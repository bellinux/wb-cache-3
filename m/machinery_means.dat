50|$|Vertebrate lenses are {{composed}} of adapted epithelial cells which have high concentrations of the protein crystallin. These crystallins belong to two major families, the α-crystallins and the βγ-crystallins. Both were categories of proteins originally used for other functions in organisms, but eventually were adapted {{for the sole purpose}} of vision in animal eyes. In the embryo, the lens is living tissue, but the cellular machinery is not transparent so must be removed before the organism can see. Removing the <b>machinery</b> <b>means</b> the lens is composed of dead cells, packed with crystallins. These crystallins are special because they have the unique characteristics required for transparency and function in the lens such as tight packing, resistance to crystallization, and extreme longevity, as they must survive for the entirety of the organism’s life. The refractive index gradient which makes the lens useful is caused by the radial shift in crystallin concentration in different parts of the lens, rather than by the specific type of protein: it is not the presence of crystallin, but the relative distribution of it, that renders the lens useful.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} global and local announcement logic (GLAL), a dynamic epistemic logic with two distinct announcement operators [...] [ϕ]^+_A and [ϕ]^-_A indexed to a subset A {{of the set}} Ag of all agents [...] for global and local announcements respectively. The boundary case [ϕ]^+_Ag corresponds to the public announcement of ϕ, as known from the literature. Unlike standard public announcements, which are model transformers, the global and local announcements are pointed model transformers. In particular, the update induced by the announcement may be different in different states of the model. Therefore, the resulting computations are trees of models, rather than the typical sequences. A consequence of our semantics is that modally bisimilar states may be distinguished in our logic. Then, we provide a stronger notion of bisimilarity and we show that it preserves modal equivalence in GLAL. Additionally, we show that GLAL is strictly more expressive than public announcement logic with common knowledge. We prove {{a wide range of}} validities for GLAL involving the interaction between dynamics and knowledge, and show that the satisfiability problem for GLAL is decidable.

The CCND 1 and HER- 2 /Neu genes were more often positioned at the periphery (mean frequency of 60 %- 83 %) of the CTs in tumor tissues of the esophagus and stomach. Moreover, this positioning revealed no association with either gene amplification or the protein over-expression status of these genes, although, in esophageal carcinoma, Kappa statistics showed a moderate agreement between amplification of the CCND 1 gene (Kappa = 0. 400) and its location within the CT, as well as with over-expression of the corresponding protein (Kappa = 0. 444). Thus, our results suggest that gene positioning in interphase chromosomes does not follow a definitive pattern neither does it depend only on gene transcriptional activity. Apparently, this positioning could be both gene- and tissue-specific, and depends on other factors acting together, such as dense-gene, chromosome size, chromatin structure, and the level and stability of its expression...|$|R

40|$|Disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which {{normally}} identifies and degrades unwanted intracellular proteins, {{is thought to}} underlie neurodegeneration. Supporting this, mutations of Parkin, a ubiquitin ligase, are associated with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Remarkably, Parkin can protect neurons against {{a wide spectrum of}} stress, including those that promote proteasome dysfunction. Although the mechanism underlying the preservation of proteasome function by Parkin is hitherto unclear, we have previously proposed that Parkin-mediated K 63 -linked ubiquitination (which is usually uncoupled from the proteasome) may serve to mitigate proteasomal stress by diverting the substrate load away from the <b>machinery.</b> By <b>means</b> of linkage-specific antibodies, we demonstrated here that proteasome inhibition indeed promotes K 63 -linked ubiquitination of proteins especially in Parkin-expressing cells. Importantly, we further demonstrated that the recruitment of Ubc 13 (an E 2 that mediates K 63 -linked polyubiquitin chain formation exclusively) by Parkin is selectively enhanced under conditions of proteasomal stress, thus identifying a mechanism by which Parkin could promote K 63 -linked ubiquitin modification in cells undergoing proteolytic stress. This mode of ubiquitination appears to facilitate the subsequent clearance of Parkin substrates via autophagy. Consistent with the proposed protective role of K 63 -linked ubiquitination in times of proteolytic stress, we found that Ubc 13 -deficient cells are significantly more susceptible to cell death induced by proteasome inhibitors compared to their wild type counterparts. Taken together, our study suggests a role for Parkin-mediated K 63 ubiquitination in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, especially during periods when the proteasome is burdened or impaired...|$|R

Here Christian, under the name of Ganlesse, unexpectedly met with him, and preserved him from the fangs of the well-breathed witnesses of the Plot, with the purpose of securing his despatches, or, if necessary, his person also, in such a manner as to place him at his own discretion--a narrow and perilous game, which he thought it better, however, to undertake, than to permit these subordinate agents, who were always ready to mutiny against all in league with them, to obtain the credit which they must have done by the seizure of the Countess of Derby's despatches.

40|$|A {{class of}} inertial-sensor systems with drift {{compensation}} has been invented {{for use in}} measuring the orientations of human heads (and perhaps other, similarly sized objects). These systems can be designed to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} prior orientation-measuring systems that are based, variously, on magnetic, optical, mechanical-linkage, and acoustical principles. The orientation signals generated by the systems of this invention could be used for diverse purposes, including controlling head-orientation-dependent virtual reality visual displays or enabling persons whose limbs are paralyzed to control <b>machinery</b> by <b>means</b> of head motions. The inventive concept admits to variations too numerous to describe here, making it necessary to limit this description to a typical system, the selected aspects of which are illustrated in the figure. A set of sensors is mounted on a bracket on a band or a cap that gently but firmly grips the wearer s head to be tracked. Among the sensors are three drift-sensitive rotationrate sensors (e. g., integrated-circuit angular- rate-measuring gyroscopes), which put out DC voltages nominally proportional to the rates of rotation about their sensory axes. These sensors are mounted in mutually orthogonal orientations for measuring rates of rotation about the roll, pitch, and yaw axes of the wearer s head. The outputs of these rate sensors are conditioned and digitized, and the resulting data are fed to an integrator module implemented in software in a digital computer. In the integrator module, the angular-rate signals are jointly integrated by any of several established methods to obtain a set of angles that represent approximately the orientation of the head in an external, inertial coordinate system. Because some drift is always present as a component of an angular position computed by integrating the outputs of angular-rate sensors, the orientation signal is processed further in a drift-compensator software module...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{isolated}} a mutant line of mouse L cells, termed gro 29, {{in which}} the growth of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is defective. The block occurs late in the infectious cycle of both viruses. We demonstrate that HSV and VSV enter gro 29 cells normally, negotiate {{the early stages of}} infection, yet are impaired at a late stage of virus maturation. During VSV infection of the mutant cell line, intracellular transport of its glycopro-tein (G protein) is slowed. Pulse-chase experiments showed that oligosaccharide processing is impeded, and immunofluorescence localization revealed an accumulation of G protein in a juxtanuclear region that contains the Golgi complex. We conclude that export of newly made glycoproteins is defective in gro 29 cells, and speculate that this defect may reflect a lesion in the glycoprotein transport apparatus. UKARYOTIC cells utilize an elaborate transport system to move newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins from their site of synthesis to their sites of action. Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) I move to the Golgi complex before being sorted for transport to cellular organelles or the cell surface. Transport and sorting require an apparatus that ensures the delivery of individual proteins to correct locations. Although substantial progress is being made in identifying the protein determinants that influence transport and processing (reviewed by Garoff, 1985), less is known about how these determinants are recognized and acted upon by the cellular transport <b>machinery.</b> One <b>means</b> of dissecting the transport apparatus of eukaryotic cells is to isolate cellular mutants defective in this process.

50|$|NcRNAs also target general {{transcription}} factors {{required for}} the RNAP II transcription of all genes. These general factors include components of the initiation complex that assemble on promoters or involved in transcription elongation. A ncRNA transcribed from an upstream minor promoter of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene forms a stable RNA-DNA triplex within the major promoter of DHFR to prevent the binding of the transcriptional co-factor TFIIB. This novel mechanism of regulating gene expression may in fact represent a widespread method of controlling promoter usage given that thousands of such triplexes exist in eukaryotic chromosome. The U1 ncRNA can induce transcription initiation by specifically binding to and stimulating TFIIH to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNAP II. In contrast the ncRNA 7SK, is able to repress transcription elongation by, in combination with HEXIM1/2, forming an inactive complex that prevents the PTEFb general transcription factor from phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNAP II, thereby repressing global elongation under stressful conditions. These examples, which bypass specific modes of regulation at individual promoters to mediate changes directly {{at the level of}} initiation and elongation transcriptional <b>machinery,</b> provide a <b>means</b> of quickly affecting global changes in gene expression.|$|R
