Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Earl {{returned}} to England in December 1586, but was sent {{again to the}} Netherlands in the following June—to the grief of his wife, as the young Earl of Essex remarked in a letter.

5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album.

Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The newly {{installed}} French {{colonial government}} promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to Algiers. Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted {{to remain as}} symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement– the menalamba rebellion– and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b> The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing.
