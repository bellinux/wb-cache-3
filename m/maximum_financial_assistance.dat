40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{regulation}} of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to {{limited liability companies}} Purpose of this thesis {{is to show that}} the regulation of the <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> for acquisition of own shares in case of limited liability company (in Czech: "společnost s ručením omezeným") does not make sense anymore. As it fails to fulfil its original purpose, and, moreover, it repeatedly causes significant problems to transactions that would bring an economical advantage if it was not for the <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> regulation. Aim of chapter one is to summarize the history and the development of the <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> regulation in the Czech Republic as well as in other jurisdictions. Some issues which are typically linked to the <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> regulation are shown by the comparison especially with the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

40|$|Abstract: The Survey of Dental Student <b>Financial</b> <b>Assistance</b> reports data {{collected}} by the American Dental Education Associa-tion on <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to dental students in the academic year 2003 - 04. Over 90 percent of students at the fifty-one respond-ing dental schools received <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> {{in the form of}} loans, grants, scholarships and/or work-study programs, with students receiving an average of $ 43, 191 per year. As tuition and fees rose 21. 4 percent over the past two years, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> rose 23. 1 percent. Both continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation. The primary source of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> was in the form of loans, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the reported <b>financial</b> <b>assistance.</b> Most of the remaining assistance was in the form of obligated or unobligated grants and scholarships, with an increasing share attributable to grants/scholarships with obligations following graduation. As the price of higher education increases, reliance on <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> continues to increase, and students graduate with an increasing amount of debt in real and constant dollars...|$|R

40|$|Official lenders provide <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to {{countries}} that face sovereign debt crisis. The availability of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> has counteracting {{effects on the}} default incentives of governments. On the one hand, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> can help to avoid defaults by bridging times of fundamental crises or resolving coordination failures among private investors. On the other hand, the insurance effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> lowers borrowing costs which induces the sovereign to accumulate higher debt levels. To assess the overall effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> on the probability of default we construct a quantitative model of endogenous credit structure and sovereign default that allows for self-fulfilling expectations of default. Calibrating the model to Argentinean data {{we find that the}} availability of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> reduces the number of defaults that occur due to self-fulfilling runs by private investors. However, {{at the same time it}} raises average debt levels causing an overall increase of the probability of default...|$|R

40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{comprehensive}} approach to the accounting reflection of repayable financial aid {{makes it impossible to}} establish an information base for the evaluation of its attraction and use. Therefore, to ensure completeness of operations related to the involvement of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> is only possible through the use of scientifically based methods of accounting and scientific researches in the field of accounting should be directed at ensuring stable financial condition of the enterprise, improving management decision-making to attract and use financial aid and prevent violations of the payment discipline. Based analysis approach to mapping returnable <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> has shown that the accounting staff has no single method for such transactions. In order to eliminate this disadvantage we offer to display repayable <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> {{as a part of the}} loan capital through the use of 609 "Swivel financial assistance" account to the opening of the analytical account of 609. 1 "Swivel <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> in the national currency", and 609. 2 "Swivel <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> in foreign currency" and the account of 505 "Long-term <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> in the national currency" and 506 "Long-term <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> in foreign currency". ...|$|R

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this work is to study how social welfare offices {{organization}} affect accessibility for those seeking immediate <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> in the municipality of Stockholm. Accessibility {{in this study is}} principally defined by Swedish Law. The study is based on an empowerment perspective. Data was collected by qualitative interviews of officials in eight social welfare offices. Search path to reach the officials was registered by participant observations. The results indicate variation in the organization of the social welfare offices and the majority have specialized intake units. Officials are available, but both information about and how to get help for immediate <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> is missing. <b>Financial</b> <b>assistance</b> is rarely available for those who can not provide identification. The mode of dispersing <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> is deemed to affect the accessibility.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{uses the}} European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data for 2006 – 2011 {{to examine whether}} there is an identifiable relationship between public and private provision of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> and whether increased public support is associated with receiving more or less private support. In line with previous research, the findings suggest that households in receipt of certain public <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> are more likely to receive <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from their friends and family. Yet the paper goes further and argues that the effect is dependent {{on the nature of the}} policy. Specifically, active policies not related to previous labour market participation appear to be associated with greater <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from friends and family compared to traditional, passive forms of welfare assistance which themselves show no effect. The paper therefore concludes that the association between private and public <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> is dependent upon the type of public assistance that is being considered...|$|R
