40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{is great}} {{controversy}} on how different set anode potentials affect {{the performance of}} a bioelectrochemical system (BES). It is often reported that more positive potentials improve acclimation and performance of exoelectrogenic biofilms, and alter microbial community structure, while in other studies relatively more negative potentials were needed to achieve higher current densities. To address this issue, the biomass, electroactivity, and community structure of anodic biofilms were examined over a wide range of set anode potentials (− 0. 25, − 0. 09, 0. 21, 0. 51, and 0. 81 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) in single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells. <b>Maximum</b> <b>currents</b> produced using a wastewater inoculum increased with anode potentials in the range of − 0. 25 to 0. 21 V, but decreased at 0. 51 and 0. 81 V.

40|$|Accurate {{simulations}} on detailed realistic head {{models are}} necessary {{to gain a better}} understanding of the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Hitherto, head models with simplified geometries and constant isotropic material properties are often used, whereas some biological tissues have anisotropic characteristics which vary naturally with frequency. Moreover, most computational methods do not take the tissue permittivity into account. Therefore, we calculate the electromagnetic behaviour due to TMS in a head model with realistic geometry and where realistic dispersive anisotropic tissue properties are incorporated, based on T 1 -weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. This paper studies the impact of tissue anisotropy, permittivity and frequency dependence, using the anisotropic independent impedance method. The results show that anisotropy yields differences up to 32 % and 19 % of the maximum induced currents and electric field, respectively. Neglecting the permittivity values leads to a decrease of about 72 % and 24 % of the <b>maximum</b> <b>currents</b> and field, respectively. Implementing the dispersive effects of biological tissues results in a difference of 6 % of the <b>maximum</b> <b>currents.</b> The cerebral voxels show limited sensitivity of the induced electric field to changes in conductivity and permittivity, whereas the field varies approximately linearly with frequency. These findings illustrate the importance of including each of the above parameters in the model and confirm the need for accuracy in the applied patient-specific method, which can be used in computer-assisted TMS...|$|E

The method is {{designed}} such that it can provide accurate detection in wide range of particles’ convergence level and does not depend {{too much on the}} re-localization/recovery process. The proposed method combines the difference in particle’s weight, <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> weight, and difference in particles’ standard deviation. The addition of these two parameters is believed to be superior to a pure <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> weight parameter for kidnapping detection. A series of simulation tests are executed to prove it. These simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> weight parameter in terms of accuracy, ability to detect kidnapping during early stage of localization, and independency towards the success of the re-localization process...|$|R
