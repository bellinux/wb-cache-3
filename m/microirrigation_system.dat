40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} pressure heads on water application uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating pressure head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for operating pressure heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum operating pressures of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased operating pressure head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a <b>microirrigation</b> <b>system</b> designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum operating pressure head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically.

Cotton lint {{yield and}} quality were {{investigated}} for different irrigation frequencies using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) under limited water conditions (1. 7 mm day– 1) in the St. Lawrence region of West Texas. Two frequency intervals were studied during two years; these intervals were 4 and 16 days in 1999 and 2 and 8 days in 2000. Each treatment was replicated four times, {{and the total}} amount of water applied each year was the same. The soil was a silty clay loam soil underlain by caliche just below 90 cm from the surface. In both years, {{there were no significant differences}} between frequency treatments in lint yield, micronaire, fiber length, fiber strength, uniformity, or gross returns. Using the loan values as an indicator of lint quality, cotton loan values were highly significant in 1999, but were not different in 2000. With no major advantage in increasing irrigation frequency using SDI under deficit conditions, these results may have an impact on the agronomic practices of the region where water is very limited.

The effects of the regulation assembly displacement and geometrical structure (regulation assembly inlet height) on regulating performance are investigated.

The spring parameters can be designed according to the force–displacement characteristic (the F–Lv curve) of the T-shape regulating plunger. A greater regulation assembly inlet height corresponds to a lower preset pressure and less sensitivity of pressure loss to the movement of the regulation assembly. The pressure distribution through the regulator provides an improved understanding of the pressure difference in the regulating plunger with various displacements.

For preventing emitter clogging, which reduces the uniformity {{and can lead}} to inoperability of microirrigation systems, filtration is mandatory. Sand media filters are broadly used to protect microirrigation systems, but their manufacturer's pressure requirements for backwashing are high and contribute to energy consumption. Previous studies have shown that pressure losses in sand media filters can be more important in the underdrain elements than in the filter bed. The main objective was to design a new underdrain that could reduce sand media pressure drop. The new underdrain has wider passages to the water chamber located at underdrain outlet, is surrounded with a granular medium with higher hydraulic conductivity and it modifies the flow curvature above the underdrain. The new underdrain was built and tested under filtration and backwashing conditions and with and without filter bed using a laboratory filter which was scaled from a commercial filter. Results show that the new underdrain reduced pressure loss by 50 % compared with a scaled commercial filter taken as reference, especially under backwashing conditions. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed to further study those filter areas where the underdrain achieved a pressure loss reduction. The new underdrain also affected pressure profile across filter bed, which was closer to the theoretically predicted by the Ergun equation. The new underdrain improves hydraulic performance of sand media filters for <b>microirrigation</b> <b>system,</b> thereby increasing both water and energy use efficiencyAcknowledgmentThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the SpanishMinistry of Economy and Competitiveness for its financial supportfor this experiment through Grant CGL 2012 - 3118...|$|E
40|$|Dripline {{flushing}} is {{a maintenance}} procedure that {{is recommended for}} all <b>microirrigation</b> <b>systems.</b> However, flushing velocity and flushing duration, which particularly affect the design and management of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems, have not been studied extensively. For {{a better understanding of}} the flushing process in driplines and manifolds, a laboratory study was conducted at Kansas State University with a 10 m transparent pipe simulating an SDI dripline. Three different sediments with sizes up to 500 µm were introduced into the pipeline, and their distribution along the pipeline was analyzed under different flushing velocities over various times. Head loss under the conditions of this study increased exponentially with increased flushing velocity, suggesting that the flow regimes could be characterized between moving beds and heterogeneous flow. The percentage of pipeline blockage was logarithmically related to the flushing velocity, with greater than 30 % of the pipeline occupied by larger sand sediments when the flushing velocity was less than 0. 3 m sˉ¹. Although flushing velocities at or near the calculated deposition velocity could remove the majority of the sediments with a short duration of 15 min or less, flushing velocities that were approximately 45 % to 65 % of the deposition velocity could achieve similar sediment removal with longer flushing duration (up to 180 min).

To meet this crop yields demand, the associated dramatic improving of water productivity (WP) must necessarily be accompanied by maximization of water use efficiency (WUE) (Ragab 2011, UNEP 2014). In this work, a recently developed software (IrriLab, [URL] moving in this direction is presented. IrriLab is a very simple toll allows to design microirrigation unit optimizing WUE, pressure energy and irrigation unit costs. Irrigation software available in commerce provide <b>microirrigation</b> <b>system</b> designs, by mainly looking at the maximum flow rate uniformity criteria. Thus, each emitter installed along the laterals operates with an operating pressure head occurring in between an established range of pressure head variability (Dh < Dhadm). However, the latter condition does not always corresponds to the cheapest and to the maximizing WUE solution; in fact, it is not assured if {{the entire range of}} the admitted pressure head is profited and used by the emitters. IrriLab allows this occurrence because, for the entire Irrigation Unit Area, IUA, each design solution assures that at least two emitters rigorously operates, one with the minimum admitted pressure head, and the other one with the maximum admitted (Dh = Dhadm), (Baiamonte et al., 2015; Baiamonte, 2016). The same extreme values of pressure head are those that in the common design criteria delimit the range of pressure head, but without assuring their achievement. Compared to the common design criteria, this condition i) for fixed laterals’ length and inside diameter, allows reducing the inlet required pressure head whereas, ii) for fixed pressure head at the inlet, provides an increasing in laterals and manifold lengths and in the associated IUA.

A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the flushing water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the flushing water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater flushing volumes, tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the flushing water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the flushing water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently flushing volume increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters. Only six emitters were nearly or fully clogged, with discharges between 0 % and 5 % of new and unused emitters. Flushing velocity and flushing frequency did not have consistent significant effects on emitter discharge, and those numerical differences that did exist were small (< 3 %). Emitter discharge was approximately 3 % less for the distal ends of the driplines (last 20 % of the dripline). Although not a specific factor in the study, the results of solids removals during flushing and solids retention within the different dripline sections suggest that duration of flushing may be a more cost‐effective management option than increasing the dripline flushing velocity through SDI system design.

However, while most design processes focus on pressure distributions and changes associated with friction and elevation differences, elevated water temperatures will change the physical properties of the water and may change the physical properties of some emitters. Laboratory studies were conducted to measure the effects of water operating temperature on the sensitivity and discharge rate of emitters from thin-walled drip tape (collapsible emitting hose) products. Two different product types (Robert’s Ro-Drip, RD; and T-Tape, TT,) each with two wall thicknesses, were evaluated. The RD product included wall thicknesses of 0. 20 mm (8 mil, RD- 08) and 0. 38 mm (15 mil, RD- 15), whereas the TT product included wall thicknesses of 0. 25 mm (10 mil, TT- 10) and 0. 38 mm (15 mil, TT- 15). Additional characterization tests included a standard operating pressure/emitter discharge rate test and a tubing tensile stress (elongation) test.

Minor losses along manifolds or at laterals inlet due to start connectors may be significant and might be considered on subunits design or while undertaking hydraulic simulations. The objectives of this research were: (a) to develop equations based on dimensional analysis to estimate minor losses due to start connectors; (b) to compare {{the accuracy of the}} developed models against models that are currently used for estimating minor losses; (c) to undertake simulations to assess the relevance of minor losses due to start connectors in hydraulics of subunits. Minor losses due to start connectors were separated into two components.

Two models were developed and validated to estimate minor losses that occur when water flows from a manifold into a lateral line through a start connector. The required data to develop and validate the models were obtained experimentally in laboratory.

Most of these home gardens rely on rain for survival, i. e., rainfed systems. At present home gardens are being neglected due to social and environmental problems. Among these issues, the scarcity of water during cropping seasons is the most important issue that adversely affects crop production from home gardens. This is mainly due to the occurrence of unexpected dry periods during the cropping seasons, and the requirement to have a water source at the farmer’s residence to irrigate the home garden during the dry spells (to capture and conserve roof runoff in the home gardens for subsequent use) is an appropriate green option to mitigate this situation. Microlevel rainwater tanks are promoted to be used to collect roof runoff water during wet periods enabling the farmer to irrigate his home garden crops during dry periods. Field experiments were carried out at Mapalana Research Farm in Sri Lanka to obtain the roof runoff coefficients from commonly used roof types; namely: asbestos, tiles, and thatched (either straw or woven coconut leaves). The objective of the case study is to develop a methodology to estimate the optimum size of a rainwater tank based on the roof size, roof cover, climatic conditions, and the irrigation requirement for home garden irrigation.

40|$|The use of lay-flat {{polyethylene}} pipes {{to irrigate}} horticultural crops has been receiving widespread {{attention in the}} last decade, due to the significant improvements in their hydraulic performance, their potentially high application efficiency, and their limited installation costs. However, even if hydraulic design procedures for conventional <b>microirrigation</b> <b>systems</b> are fairly well established, {{there is still the}} need to know how different pipe-wall thicknesses of lay-flat pipes can affect the pipe geometry under different operating pressures as well as the related consequences on friction losses. This paper, after comparing two different procedures (caliper and photographic) to assess the geometry of lay-flat polyethylene pipes under different operating pressures, analyzes the friction losses per unit of pipe length, J, in order to identify and to assess a procedure for their evaluation. Hydrostatic tests, initially carried out on pipes with wall thicknesses of 6, 8, and 10 thousandth of an inch (mil), evidenced that the pipe dimensions measured with both methods are quite similar, despite the generally higher standard deviations characterizing caliper measurements when compared to photographic method. Tests allowed to verify that most of the changes in pipe dimensions occur within a range of pressure from 0 kPa to about 30 kPa, with pipe horizontal width and vertical height quite similar at higher pressures and pipes have a tendency to become circular. Additionally, due to the elasticity of the material, over a certain limit of water pressure, both the pipe dimensions tend to rise, with a trend depending on pipe thickness. According to the experimental data, the relationships between pipe effective diameter and water pressure were then determined for the three considered pipes. Moreover, based on measured friction losses and pipe effective diameters, it was confirmed that the relationship between the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, f, and the Reynolds number, R, can be described by a power equation in which, by assuming a value of - 0. 25 for the exponent, it results a coefficient c = 0. 285, lower than the theoretical. For the three investigated pipes the errors associated to estimated J were finally evaluated by considering (1) the experimental relationships between friction factor and Reynolds number as well as between pipe diameter and operating pressure (Case A); (2) the same value of c, but pipe effective diameters of 16. 20, 16. 10, and 15. 85 mm corresponding to p = plim (Case B); (3) the standard procedure, with a value of c = 0. 302 and the pipe diameter equal to 16. 10 mm, as suggested by the manufacturer. The results evidenced that suitable estimations of J need to account for the variations of the pipe effective diameter with water pressure. On the other hand, incorrect values of pipe diameter combined with inexact values of the friction factor generate inaccurate estimations of friction losses, with unavoidable consequences in pipe design...|$|R
