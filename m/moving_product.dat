The model {{is designed to}} distinguish fast moving products within a relatively short period. Under the proposed model, the sales of a newly introduced product are monitored for a prespecied period T, e. g., one week, and {{if the number of}} items sold over T is equal to a prespecied integer k or more, the product is considered a fast <b>moving</b> <b>product</b> and is carried over to the following sales periods. A slow <b>moving</b> <b>product</b> could be quickly replaced with alternative merchandise in order to make best use of shelf space. The paper rst presents denitions of fast and slow moving products, and then a proposed sales test policy based on the model is formulated, where the expected loss is to be minimized with respect to the integer k. Numerical examples based on actual data collected from a convenience store in Japan are also presented to illustrate the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed sales test model...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe visual {{aspect of}} rough {{surfaces}} such as steel surfaces becomes {{of great importance}} {{for the quality of}} the final product they are dedicated to. In a previous work, we have solved the theoretically complex problem of automatically classifying surfaces according to the quality of their aspect. In this case, the measurements were based on topographical maps obtained through interferometric microscopy. The resulting data were analyzed by an algorithm based on morphological and statistical features extraction from surface topography, factorial analysis, bootstrap over-sampling and Bayesian classification. It was then important to apply this methodology as efficiently as possible to perform an automatic, on-line and continuous inspection of the product. In this paper, we focus on all steps leading to such an on-line application, among which choosing an optical sensor and the corresponding optical configuration adapted to an industrial environment and overcoming all difficulties to go from first laboratory tests to on-line measurements on fast <b>moving</b> <b>product</b> are particularly determining.

40|$|Laser-EMAT (ElectroMagnetic Acoustic Transducer) ultrasonics is a {{suitable}} technique for on-line surface and internal defect detection in a steel mill. The system {{is intended to}} automatically inspect steel, at temperatures in excess of 700 degrees C, as it moves through the steel manufacturing process. It {{is one of the}} few ultrasonic systems that could ever be used in the harsh operating environment of a steel mill due to its non-contact nature. In the laboratory and pilot development stages, the equipment can be optimised and designed to work under these harsh conditions. Before the technology can be used on hot, <b>moving</b> <b>product</b> in the steel plant, it is necessary to conduct experiments on moving steel at ambient temperatures, so that system optimisation is performed under more practical conditions.

The laserEMAT system was later used to find a surface defect in the steel, as it moved at 800 degrees C on a pilot scale rolling mill.

40|$|With {{advancement}} in {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID), RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counter-feiting has attracted considerable research interests. Track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting demands a trustworthy electronic pedigree (e-pedigree), which records the movements of product items from manufacturers to retailers, to ensure high supply chain visibility and to provide evidence for product authentication. Creation and synchronization of initial e-pedigrees in the manufacturing stage is particularly crucial to the accuracy and trustworthiness of subsequent processing of the e-pedigrees and authentication of product items. This is a critical yet challenging task, as it involves a number of practical issues, such as incomplete tag writing/locking, environment disturbances, and potential data falsification. This paper first presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, and then proposes a tag data processing and synchronization (TDPS) algorithm to generate initial e-pedigrees for general, tangible products during production. An RFID-enabled apparel packaging line is established to validate the performance of TDPS and identify the bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Experiment results show that TDPS can create accurate and secure initial e-pedigrees for fast <b>moving</b> <b>product</b> items, and that tag EPC writing is a major bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Thus, we optimise TDPS by incorporating a block writing method and an integrated verification step to remove the bottleneck. Further experiments demonstrate the optimised TDPS {{can be adapted to}} suit different practical requirements to achieve a good balance between tag writing/locking rate and the moving speed of product items in packaging lines without severing the throughput...|$|E

40|$|Drying, curing, baking are {{few of the}} {{manufacturing}} processes that {{require the use of}} impingement ovens. For {{the manufacturing}} of large batches typically continuous flow ovens are used that are part of an automated conveyor processing line. The retention time for a product to be treated in the oven usually drives the production efficiencies (i. e. energy usage or lead times). In many processing lines though, the ovens are not designed and run in the most efficient way, and as a result become the “bottleneck” process phase. In such ovens, usually the hot air is ejected from rows of nozzles perpendicularly to the <b>moving</b> <b>product.</b> In the most advanced designs the ovens are divided in zones, with each zone having different targeted operating temperature. The optimization of the manufacturing process is difficult to be experimentally determined due to several reasons: the length of the ovens and the complexity of the movement of the product {{in and out of the}} oven are the most challenging ones. The main objective of this paper thus is the development of a Computer Fluid Dynamics model for simulating the thermal - transfer efficiency of an existing hot-air convection oven used to produce continuous products. The model is used for the estimation of the maximum speed that the conveyor belt can be run, and further investigate possible improvements on the design of the oven for the reduction of the cycle time.

40|$|The bullwhip {{effect is}} a {{pervasive}} problem in multi echelon supply chains that results in inefficient production operations and higher inventory levels. The causes of the bullwhip effect are well understood in industry and academia. Quantitative and qualitative solutions to attenuate this effect have been proposed in various research studies. In this research a quantitative solution {{in the form of}} a Statistical Process Control (SPC) based inventory management system is proposed that reduces the bullwhip effect while reducing inventory without compromising service level requirements for a variety of products. The strength of this methodology is in its effectiveness in reducing bullwhip for fast <b>moving</b> <b>products</b> in the mature phase of their lifecycles where improving production efficiency and lowering inventory investment are critical. However, fill rate issues are observed for slow <b>moving</b> <b>products</b> and therefore, the methodology is not recommended for such products.
