The {{apparatus}} used may {{be described}} in general terms as consisting of two metallic spheres of unequal diameter, placed, the smaller within the larger, and concentric with it; the interval between the two being the space through which the induction was to take place. A section of it is given (Plate VII. fig. 104.) {{on a scale of}} one-half: a, a are the two halves of a brass sphere, with an air-tight joint at b, like that of the <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> made perfectly flush and smooth inside so as to present no irregularity; c is a connecting piece by which the apparatus is joined to a good stop-cock d, which is itself attached either to the metallic foot e, or to an air-pump. The aperture within the hemisphere at f is very small: g is a brass collar fitted to the upper hemisphere, through which the shell-lac support of the inner ball and its stem passes; h is the inner ball, also of brass; it screws on to a brass stem i, terminated above by a brass ball B, l, l is a mass of shell-lac, moulded carefully on to i, and serving both to support and insulate it and its balls h, B. The shell-lac stem l is fitted into the socket g, by a little ordinary resinous cement, more fusible than shell-lac, applied at mm {{in such a way as}} to give sufficient strength and render the apparatus air-tight there, yet leave as much as possible of the lower part of the shell-lac stem untouched, as an insulation between the ball h and the surrounding sphere a, a. The ball h has a small aperture at n, so that when the apparatus is exhausted of one gas and filled with another, the ball h may itself also be exhausted and filled, that no variation of the gas in the interval o may occur during the course of an experiment.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres</b> are a pair {{of large}} copper hemispheres, with mating rims. They were used to {{demonstrate}} the power of atmospheric pressure. When the rims were sealed with grease {{and the air was}} pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. The <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres</b> were designed by a German scientist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke, to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented, and the concept of atmospheric pressure. The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli, and had inspired Guericke to design the world's first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way flap valves. The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education. A pair of the original hemispheres are preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> around 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter, were {{designed}} to demonstrate the vacuum pump that Guericke had invented. One {{of them had a}} tube connection to attach the pump, with a valve to close it off. When the air was sucked out from inside the hemispheres, and the valve was closed, the hose from the pump could be detached, and they were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Influenced by Torricelli, Otto von Guericke {{invented a}} vacuum pump by modifying an air gun pump. Guericke {{put on a}} {{demonstration}} in 1654 in Magdeburg, Germany, where he was mayor. Two copper hemispheres were fitted together and air was pumped out. Weights strapped to the hemispheres could not pull them apart until the air valve was opened. The experiment was repeated in 1656 using two teams of 8 horses each, which could not separate the <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artificial vacuum {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1643 by Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli and further developed by German scientist Otto von Guericke with his <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> Guerike's demonstration was documented by Gaspar Schott, {{in a book}} that was read by Robert Boyle. Boyle and his assistant Robert Hooke improved Guericke's air pump design and built their own. From this, through various experiments, they formulated what is called Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a body of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Soon the ideal gas law was formulated.|$|E
50|$|In 1654, Otto von Guericke {{invented the}} first vacuum pump and {{conducted}} his famous <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres</b> experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres {{from which the}} air had been partially evacuated.

Thereafter, research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when August Toepler invented the Toepler Pump and Heinrich Geissler invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855, achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 Pa (0.1 Torr). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, which renewed interest in further research.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea was}} restated as [...] "Natura abhorret vacuum." [...] by François Rabelais in his {{series of books}} titled Gargantua and Pantagruel in the 1530s. The theory was {{supported}} and restated by Galileo Galilei in the early 17th century as [...] "Resintenza del vacuo." [...] Galilei {{was surprised by the}} fact that water could not rise above a certain level in an aspiration tube in his suction pump, leading him to conclude that {{there is a limit to}} the phenomenon. René Descartes proposed a plenic interpretation of atomism to eliminate the void, which he considered incompatible with his concept of space. The theory was rejected by later scientists, such as Galileo's pupil Evangelista Torricelli who repeated his experiment with mercury. Blaise Pascal successfully repeated Galilei's and Torricelli's experiment and foresaw no reason why a perfect vacuum could not be achieved in principle. Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle mentioned Pascal's experiment in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia in an 1823 article titled [...] "Pascal". The <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres</b> used by Otto von Guericke in 1650 were seen by some as proof that the theory was not correct.|$|E

5000|$|His {{scientific}} and diplomatic pursuits finally intersected when, at the Reichstag in Regensburg in 1654, {{he was invited}} to demonstrate his experiments on the vacuum before the highest dignitaries of the Holy Roman Empire. One of them, the Archbishop Elector Johann Philip von Schonborn, bought von Guericke's apparatus from him and had it sent to his Jesuit College at Wurzburg. One of the professors at the College, Fr. Gaspar Schott, entered into friendly correspondence with von Guericke and thus it was that, at the age of 55, von Guericke's work was first published as an Appendix to a book by Fr. Schott - Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica - published in 1657. This book {{came to the attention of}} Robert Boyle who, stimulated by it, embarked on his own experiments on air pressure and the vacuum, and in 1660 published New Experiments Physico-Mechanical touching the Spring of Air and its Effects. The following year this was translated into Latin and, made aware of it in correspondence with Fr. Schott, von Guericke acquired a copy.In the decade following the first publication of his own work von Guericke, in addition to his diplomatic and administrative commitments, was scientifically very active. He embarked upon his magnum opus [...] - [...] Ottonis de Guericke Experimenta Nova (ut vocantur) Magdeburgica de Vacuo Spatio [...] - [...] which as well as a detailed account of his experiments on the vacuum, contains his pioneering electrostatic experiments in which electrostatic repulsion was demonstrated for the first time and sets out his theologically based view of the nature of space. In the Preface to the Reader he claims to have finished the book on March 14, 1663 though publication was delayed for another nine years until 1672. In 1664, his work again appeared in print, again through the good offices of Fr. Schott, the first section of whose book Technica Curiosa, entitled Mirabilia Magdeburgica, was dedicated to von Guericke's work. The earliest reference to the celebrated <b>Magdeburg</b> <b>hemispheres</b> experiment is on p. 39 of the Technica Curiosa, where Fr. Schott notes that von Guericke had mentioned them in a letter of July 22, 1656. Fr. Schott goes on to quote a subsequent letter of von Guericke of August 4, 1657 in which he states that he now had carried out the experiment, at considerable cost, with 12 horses.|$|E
