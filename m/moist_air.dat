5|$|Bismuth {{is stable}} to both dry and <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> at {{ordinary}} temperatures. When red-hot, it reacts {{with water to}} make bismuth(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|A {{warm front}} can produce snow for a period, as warm, <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> {{overrides}} below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to {{rain in the}} warm sector behind the front.|$|E
50|$|As the updraft rotates and ingests cooler <b>moister</b> <b>air</b> {{from the}} forward flank {{downdraft}} (FFD), it may form a wall cloud, a spinning layer of clouds lowered from ambient storm cloud base under the mid-level mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form {{closer to the}} center of the mesocyclone. As it descends, a funnel cloud may form near its center. This is the first visible stage of tornadogenesis.|$|R

50|$|The snake's habitat {{includes}} rainforests, <b>moist</b> open <b>air</b> {{forests and}} waterways. It is found from mid-eastern New South Wales {{to the tip}} of far-north Queensland.|$|R
5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of indium with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors. Many of them slowly decompose in <b>moist</b> <b>air,</b> necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent {{contact with the}} atmosphere. Indium nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (TiCl4), a colorless liquid, {{is important}} {{as an intermediate}} {{in the process of}} making TiO2 and is also used to produce the Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and, because it fumes strongly in <b>moist</b> <b>air,</b> it is used to make smoke screens.|$|E
5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. Finely powdered lead, as with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moist</b> {{tropical}} <b>air</b> {{keeps the}} weather {{warm in the}} Paraneña region from October through March. In Asunción the temperature averages about 27.96 C during January, the warmest month.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moist</b> hot <b>air</b> {{treatment}} of sets is suggested to control infection before planting. This reduces percentage of disease incidence, but causes {{a reduction in}} the percentage of bud sprouting.|$|R
50|$|As noted above, {{single wall}} steel conducts heat. In {{temperate}} climates, <b>moist</b> interior <b>air</b> condenses against the steel, becoming clammy. Rust will form unless the steel is well sealed and insulated.|$|R
5|$|Lutetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, {{but not in}} <b>moist</b> <b>air.</b> Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths. Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such.|$|E
5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> or moist argon, {{the metal}} oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} of Kansas, winter weather is {{extremely}} variable, although extreme maxima are not as hot as in the southwest of the state as Pittsburg {{is far from the}} influence of hot chinook winds. Arctic outbreaks bring temperatures to or below 0 F on average once per winter, whilst maxima over 70 F can be expected four times between December and February. Winter weather is less dry than in most of Kansas since <b>moist</b> Gulf <b>air</b> often penetrates without reaching most of the state: December 2015 saw 7.91 in of rain, and the very cold January 1979 saw sixteen days with at least 0.01 in of measurable precipitation. Because the <b>moister</b> <b>air</b> masses are warm, heavy snowfall is uncommon in Pittsburg: the mean is 11.9 in and only twelve months have seen more than 10 in, with the most in a month being 24.5 in in January 1979. The most snow in a day has been 13 in on December 13, 2000, and the most snow on the ground 14 in on February 4 and 5, 2011 and March 17, 1970.|$|R
50|$|It {{grows on}} the Great Lakes shorelines in cool, <b>moist</b> lake shore <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{beneficial}} weed {{can be used}} as {{a companion}} plant to crops. Like most members of the umbellifer family, it attracts wasps to its small flowers in its native land; however, where it has been introduced, it attracts very few wasps. This species is also documented to boost tomato plant production when kept nearby, and it can provide a microclimate of cooler, <b>moister</b> <b>air</b> for lettuce, when intercropped with it. However, the states of Iowa, Ohio, Michigan and Washington have listed it as a noxious weed, and it is considered a serious pest in pastures. It persists in the soil seed bank for two to five years.|$|R
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with <b>moist</b> <b>air,</b> and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{itself had}} minimal effects on land, but the monsoon {{advanced}} into western India in late May {{in association with}} the system. As the cyclone moved to the west away from the subcontinent, the incursion of <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> from the Arabian Sea persisted over northwestern India for the first three days of June. This brought moderate rainfall to regions of Gujarat, Rajasthan and western Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{steady-state}} stationary thermal convection of <b>moist</b> saturated <b>air</b> {{in a lower}} atmosphere has been studied theoretically. Thermal convection was considered without accounting for the Coriolis force, and with only the vertical temperature gradient. The analytical solution of geophysical fluid dynamics equations, which generalizes the formulation of the moist convection problem, is obtained in the two-dimensional case. The stream function is derived in the Boussinesq approximation with velocity divergence taken as zero. It {{has been shown that}} the stream function is asymmetrical in vertical direction contrary to the dry and <b>moist</b> unsaturated <b>air</b> convection. It has been demonstrated that the convection in moist atmosphere strongly depends on the vapor mass fraction gradient...|$|R
50|$|Similar {{rainfall}} {{is caused}} when <b>moist</b> ocean <b>air</b> is lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, and this produces condensation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Considerable {{evidence}} has emerged of a substantial decade-long {{change in the}} north Pacific atmosphere and ocean lasting from about 1976 to 1988. Observed {{significant changes in the}} atmospheric circulation throughout the troposphere revealed a deeper and eastward shifted Aleutian low pressure system in the winter half year which advected warmer and <b>moister</b> <b>air</b> along the west coast of North America and into Alaska and colder air over the north Pacific. Consequently, there were increases in temperatures and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) along the west coast of North America and Alaska but decreases in SSTs over the central north Pacific, as well as changes in coastal rainfall and streamflow, and decreases in sea ice in the Bering Sea. Associated changes occurred in the surfac...|$|R
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in <b>moist</b> <b>air,</b> protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in <b>moist</b> <b>air.</b> It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> and reacting with glass.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of deep moist convection in radiative–convective equilibrium over a constant sea surface temperature is studied. A 100 -day simulation is performed with a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model over a (576 km) 2 domain with no ambient rotation and no mean wind. The convection self-aggregates within 10 days into quasi-stationary mesoscale patches of dry, subsiding and <b>moist,</b> rainy <b>air</b> columns. The patches ultimately merge {{into a single}} intensely convecting moist patch surrounded by a broad region of very dry subsiding air. The self-aggregation is analyzed as an instability of a horizontally homogeneous convecting atmosphere driven by convection–water vapor–radiation feedbacks that systematically dry the drier air columns and moisten the <b>moister</b> <b>air</b> columns. Column-integrated heat, water, and moist static energy budgets over (72 km) 2 horizontal blocks show that this instability is primarily initiated by the reduced radiative cooling of air columns {{in which there is}} extensive anvil cirrus, augmented by enhanced surface latent and sensible heat fluxes under convectively active regions due to storm-induced gustiness. Mesoscale circulations intensify the later stages of self-aggregation by fluxing moist static energy from the dry to the moist regions. A simple mathematical model of the initial phase of self-aggregation is proposed based on the simulations...|$|R
50|$|A dry punch is {{meteorological}} {{slang for}} a synoptic scale or mesoscale process. A dry punch {{at the surface}} results in a dry line bulge. A dry punch aloft above an area of warm, <b>moist</b> (buoyant) <b>air</b> at low levels often increases the potential for severe thunderstorms.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate is}} severe. For {{most of the}} year, the region is covered by masses of cold Arctic air with low {{moisture}} and dust content. In summer, warmer and <b>moister</b> Pacific <b>air</b> blows from the south-east. Dry and strongly warmed air masses periodically blow from Siberia.|$|R
5|$|The 2007 Midwest flooding, which {{affected}} the hilly Driftless area of southeast Minnesota {{was the result}} of a training pattern of storms mixing warm <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> from Tropical Storm Erin with cooler Canadian air, resulting in record 24-hour rainfall totals of up to , with a similar flooding event in 2010 as a result of the remnants of tropical storm Georgette in the eastern Pacific and Hurricane Karl in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms {{are responsible for}} the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, <b>moist</b> <b>air</b> forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{areas of}} the eastern sector are snow-covered. Two-thirds of the glaciers, {{accounting}} for five-sixths of the area, lie in the eastern section. This section receives the southwest monsoons, which enter the Tibetan plateau at the Yarlung Zanbo river's Grand Bend. The air is forced up by the terrain, and yields the highest rainfall and <b>moistest</b> <b>air</b> of the plateau, which feeds the development of glaciers. There are thirty-two glaciers that are over 10 km long. Kyagquen Glacier is the largest, covering 207 km2 and extending for 35.3 km. The end of the Qiaqing glacial tongue is at 2530 m {{in an area of}} mountain forests. The glacier foot is at [...]According to the Langzhou Glaciers Research Institute, there are a total of 2,905 glaciers in the range covering a total area of 5898 km2.|$|R
