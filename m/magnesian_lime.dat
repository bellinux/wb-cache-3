40|$|Due {{to their}} nature and function, {{historic}} lime mortars weather and often {{need to be}} replaced. Petrographic analysis of original mortars from Ardamullivan Castle evidenced that they were fabricated with a dolomitic limestone. Within, Ardamullivan Castle’s conservation programme it was considered to replicate the original mortars to undertake conservation works to the Castle. However, documentary research revealed {{that there is a}} lack of agreement on the properties of <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> as well as a lack of experimental work in the subject. Therefore, it was deemed necessary to evaluate the properties of <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> prior to its use. To this aim, dolomite was calcinated in a limekiln and the lime obtained slaked for a year. <b>Magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> mortars were then fabricated and tested in the laboratory. Porosity, densities, compressive strength, capillary suction and absorption were evaluated. The lower values of capillary raise, porosity and absorption obtained for the <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> mortars when compared to those of feebly hydraulic limes suggest that <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> binders woul...|$|E
40|$|Most {{historic}} and traditional mortars {{were made with}} lime. Due to their nature and function lime mortars weather {{and need to be}} replaced. Ordinary portland cement mortars can often be incompatible with historic masonry causing structural and aesthetic damage. Petrographic analysis of original mortars from Clonmacnoise Monastery and Ardamullivan Castle evidenced that they were fabricated with feebly hydraulic and <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> respectively. Within a National Monuments ’ conservation programme, the original mortars were replicated and tested and the best performers selected to undertake repairs. This paper investigates mortars made with four types of lime binder: fat, feebly-hydraulic, moderately-hydraulic and <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime.</b> The results indicate that lime mortars conduct moisture {{to a greater extent than}} OPC mortars. The feebly-hydraulic lime mortar has the lightest microstructure and highest porosity and absorption, being capable of holding the greatest amount of moisture thus being more susceptible to failure by water ingress. The results suggest that both fat and mg-lime binders would perform superiorly in areas subject to moisture ingress. As expected, the hydraulic set provides mortars with an additional strength and therefore both mg and fa...|$|E
30|$|After {{washing and}} centrifugation, the dried ash cakes were gently crushed and sieved to 125  µm. A {{fraction}} of the unwashed ash was also sieved to 125  µm. Preliminary powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the fresh laboratory ash identified the presence of calcite, <b>magnesian</b> calcite, <b>lime,</b> periclase and fairchildite, while some minor peaks remained unmatched. Washed laboratory ash almost entirely consists of calcite, with traces of <b>magnesian</b> calcite, <b>lime</b> and periclase (see Additional file 1).|$|R
40|$|<b>Magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> is {{made from}} dolomitic limestone. The {{properties}} of <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> mortars are not yet clearly established: some authors claim that Mg-lime has no hydraulicity and produces poor quality mortars that fracture, while others state that it produces quality hydraulic mortars. Here, Mg-lime was produced by burning magnesium limestone in a traditional limekiln. Mortars were made with increasing proportions of Mg-lime and calcium lime (CL 90), and tested according to both European and ASTM Standards, and RILEM recommendations. Shrinkage, compressive and flexural strengths, absorption, capillary suction, density and porosity were evaluated, and the relationships between workability (measured as initial flow), water demand and strength investigated. The process of lime production evidenced that fabrication parameters are instrumental {{on the quality of}} Mg-lime and the subsequent mortar?s performance. Temperatures over 900 ?C induced over-burning resulting in clinker formation and a lack of reactivity. The choice of kiln fuel and burning arrangement proved essential in order to reach a homogeneous calcination; and sieving of unslaked and over/underburnt particles as well as trials to determine raw feed proportions, were needed in order to avoid poor quality lime. Testing evidenced that the higher the Mg content, the greatest the mortar?s shrinkage. However, shrinkage did not reach unacceptable values and cracking didn?t occur. It was also evidenced that the Mg-lime possessed a lower water demand than the CL; and that Mg mortars behave well towards fluids (their capillary suction was lower and their porosity and absorption similar to those of CL 90 mortars). The results also suggest that Mg-lime mortars possess compressive and flexural strengths equivalent to those of some feebly-hydraulic lime mortars: Mg-lime strength falls within the EN 459 - 1 strength requirements for natural feebly-hydraulic lime. This research concludes that, providing production is correct, Mg-limes produce reliable masonry mortars which will shrink further but will possess a lower water demand and a slightly higher mechanical strength than CL mortars...|$|E
40|$|Liguria {{has always}} been a region with a rich {{production}} of binders, especially lime and, in part, hydraulic lime. The excellent quality of <b>magnesian</b> <b>lime</b> and the high cost of hydraulic lime did not favor the spread in the region of hydraulic binders. However, the potential of the cement sector did not escape Genoa’s entrepreneurship which was initially supported by substantial investments outside Liguria, especially in Piedmont and Lombardy. Only {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century the first cement plants in Liguria were built on the hydraulic lime production sites (in the Genoa and Imperia provinces). Despite the initial fervour, many production companies did not make it to the twenties and were closed down, downsized or changed their activity due to a crisis in the construction industry. Over time the factories and quarries were abandoned and most were demolished, today there are just a few testimonials left...|$|E
