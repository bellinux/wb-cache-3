50|$|Following {{the single}} WB-47B weather {{reconnaissance}} conversion, {{in the early}} 1960s, 34 B-47Es were converted by Lockheed into WB-47Es for weather reconnaissance to replace 44 WB-50D Superfortresses that had experienced an alarming number of fatal crashes between 1956 and 1960. These aircraft were stripped of combat gear, including the tail turret. They were fitted with cameras in the nose {{to take pictures of}} cloud formations, and carried a special <b>meteorological</b> <b>instrument</b> pod in the bomb bay. Initially assigned to the Air Weather Service of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), they became part of the Military Airlift Command (MAC) when that organization was established. The WB-47Es were abruptly grounded in September 1969 and retired the next month, the last B-47s in operational USAF service.|$|E

5000|$|Remote sensing, {{as used in}} meteorology, is {{the concept}} of {{collecting}} data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. Each remote sensing instrument collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. The most common types of remote sensing are radar, lidar, and satellites (also photogrammetry). The main uses of radar are to collect information concerning the coverage and characteristics of precipitation and wind. Satellites are chiefly used to determine cloud cover, as well as wind. SODAR (SOnic Detection And Ranging) is a <b>meteorological</b> <b>instrument</b> as one form of wind profiler, which measures the scattering of sound waves by atmospheric turbulence. Sodar systems are used to measure wind speed at various heights above the ground, and the thermodynamic structure of the lower layer of the atmosphere. Radar and lidar are not passive because both use electromagnetic radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere. [...] Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Niño.|$|E

40|$|The intraseasonal {{variability}} of SST {{associated with the}} passage of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is well documented; yet coupled model integrations generally underpredict the magnitude of this SST variability. Observations from the Improved <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Instrument</b> (IMET) mooring in the western Pacific during the intensive observing period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) showed a large diurnal signal in SST that is modulated by the passage of the MJO. In this study, observations from the IOP of the TOGA COARE and a one-dimensional (1 D) ocean mixed layer model incorporating the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) vertical mixing scheme have been used to investigate the rectification of the intraseasonal {{variability of}} SST by the diurnal cycle and the implied impact of the absence of a representation of this process on the modeled intraseasonal variability in coupled GCMs. Analysis of the SST observations has shown that the increase of the daily mean SST by the diurnal cycle of SST accounts for about one-third of the magnitude of intraseasonal variability of SST associated with the Madden–Julian oscillation in the western Pacific warm pool.

40|$|Solar eclipses {{provide a}} rapidly {{changing}} solar radiation environment. These changes can be studied using simple photodiode sensors, if the radiation reaching the sensors is unaffected by cloud. Transporting the sensors aloft using standard <b>meteorological</b> <b>instrument</b> packages modified to carry extra sensors, provides one promising but hitherto unexploited possibility for making solar eclipse radiation measurements. For the 20 th March 2015 solar eclipse, a coordinated campaign of balloon-carried solar radiation measurements was undertaken from Reading (51. 44 N, 0. 94 W), Lerwick (60. 15 N, 1. 13 W) and Reykjavik (64. 13 N, 21. 90 W), straddling {{the path of the}} eclipse. The balloons reached sufficient altitude at the eclipse time for eclipse-induced variations in solar radiation and solar limb darkening to be measured above cloud. Because the sensor platforms were free to swing, techniques have been evaluated to correct the measurements for their changing orientation. In the swing-averaged technique, the mean value across a set of swings was used to approximate the radiation falling on a horizontal surface; in the swing-maximum technique, the direct beam was estimated by assuming the sensing surface becomes normal to the solar beam direction at a maximum swing. Both approaches, essentially independent,give values that agree with theoretical expectations for the eclipse-induced radiation changes...|$|E

Wind friction velocity and surface turbulent buoyancy flux were estimated using eddy-covariance, spectral, bulk and profile methods. The comparisons of the four methods show a reasonable agreement except for the spectral buoyancy flux. This suggests that the platform design is correct. Also the wind measured at a fixed height above the sea shows spectral coherence with wave heights, such that wind and swell are in phase, with largest wind values on top of swell crests. This result in qualitative agreement with current model predictions supports the capability of OCARINA to investigate wind-swell interactions...|$|E
40|$|The Orbview- 1 {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} in April, 1995. It is a small, low-orbiting satellite with two scientific payloads, the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and the GPS <b>Meteorological</b> <b>instrument</b> (GPS-Met). The Orbview- 1 mission was developed in alignment with NASA 2 ̆ 7 s directive of 2 ̆ 2 cheaper, better, faster 2 ̆ 2 satellite programs. An important element in achieving these goals is the reduction in operations cost through spacecraft automation. A highly autonomous satellite minimizes the amount of human interaction required once the spacecraft is on-orbit. In alignment with this philosophy, the Orbview- 1 Mission Operations have also been increasingly automated. This process has led to reduction of operating costs, scheduling errors and operational errors. It has also resulted in significant improvements in the rate and reliability of data delivery. This paper will provide descriptions of the Orbview- 1 spacecraft and the Orbital Ground Segment which provides Command and Control capabilities for this satellite. It will discuss the progression of the automation of Orbview- 1 Mission Operations from inception to {{the present and the}} specific improvements in operating costs, data collection and data quality realized from each step. This paper will also suggest additional changes which can be implemented to further automate Orbview- 1 Mission Operations and which automation steps can be transferred to future satellite missions...|$|E
