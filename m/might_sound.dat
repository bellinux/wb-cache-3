Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach.

25|$|Darwin's {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, as in much of life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees {{at the time were}} mainly interested in behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific than it <b>might</b> <b>sound,</b> with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered 'good'; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated, as immortalized in Hugo Rheinhold's Affe mit Schädel (see image, left). By the end of the 19th century, chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this process}} <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> slow, {{it is very}} cache-local and highly {{parallelizable}} {{due to the lack}} of register dependencies and therefore in fact has excellent performance on modern out-of-order execution CPUs. A red-black tree for example performs much better on paper, but is highly cache-unfriendly and causes multiple pipeline and TLB stalls on modern CPUs which makes that algorithm bound by memory latency rather than CPU speed. In comparison, a bitwise trie rarely accesses memory, and when it does, it does so only to read, thus avoiding SMP cache coherency overhead. Hence, it is increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for code that performs many rapid insertions and deletions, such as memory allocators (e.g., recent versions of the famous Doug Lea's allocator (dlmalloc) and its descendents).|$|E

25|$|More and more, architects are {{investigating}} ways that courtyards {{can play a}} role in the development of today's homes and cities. In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a safe place for children to play. With space at a premium, architects are experimenting with courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, who could take pride in ownership of the space. Though this <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> like a modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E

500|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} in 1941 when Ted Williams of the Red Sox batted [...]406, {{becoming the}} last player to bat over [...]400 in a season. Despite his accomplishment, Williams lost the AL MVP {{race to the}} Yankees' Joe DiMaggio, who holds the record for a hitting streak, with 56 straight games {{in which he had}} a hit. DiMaggio's unprecedented streak started on May 15, 1941 in a game where the Yankees lost 13–1 to the Chicago White Sox. Williams later reminisced about his rivalry with DiMaggio saying [...] "(Joe) DiMaggio was the greatest all-around player I ever saw. His career cannot be summed up in numbers and awards. It <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> corny, but he had a profound and lasting impact on the country." [...] Both teams almost swapped the two players.

500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E
500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Keith Caulfied of Billboard deemed it as a [...] "very dance-by-the-numbers with Madonna" [...] song, and further assessed that the chorus made [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] a memorable song. Robbie Daw from Idolator said that [...] "Madge [...] doing [...] {{what she does}} best: turning up the heat on the dance floor," [...] but that [...] "the song is packed with tried-but-true sexual pop cliches." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars.

It's {{the sound of a}} woman who hits the dance-floor for restoration more than craziness." [...] Haigh from Attitude believed that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] should have been released as the lead single from MDNA.

[...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the [...] "pop stomper" [...] track, writing: [...] "The production <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> like she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting.

When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan.

500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love". Composed in the house genre, it begins with Madonna singing over a [...] "regal" [...] piano line, {{eventually}} joined by percussion. Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed to partake of narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> like I'm an Unapologetic Bitch but sometimes you have to call it like it is".
