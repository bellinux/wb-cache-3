He claimed that Beaujolais producers had long ignored the warning signs that such a backlash was coming and continued to produce what Mauss termed vin de <b>merde</b> (shit wine). This triggered an outcry among Beaujolais producers followed by an association of 56 cooperative producers filing a lawsuit against the Lyon Mag for publishing Mauss' comments.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{importance}} in cell shape and polarity generation, {{the organization of}} microtubules in differentiated cells and tissues remains relatively unexplored in mammals. We generated transgenic mice in which the epidermis expresses a fluorescently labeled microtubule-binding protein and show that in epidermis and in cultured keratinocytes, microtubules stereotypically reorganize as they differentiate. In basal cells, microtubules form a cytoplasmic network emanating from an apical centrosome. In suprabasal cells, microtubules concentrate at cell–cell junctions. The centrosome retains its ability to nucleate microtubules in differentiated cells, but no longer anchors them. During epidermal differentiation, ninein, which is a centrosomal protein required for microtubule anchoring (Dammermann, A., and A. <b>Merdes.</b> 2002. J.

40|$|The cDNA coding for calf filensin, a membrane-associated protein of {{the lens}} fiber cells, has been cloned and sequenced. The {{predicted}} 755 - amino acid-long open reading frame shows primary and secondary structure similarity to intermediate filament (IF) proteins. Filensin {{can be divided into}} an NH 2 -terminal domain (head) of 38 amino acids, a middle domain (rod) of 279 amino acids, and a COOH-terminal domain (tail) of 438 amino acids. The head domain contains a di- arginine/aromatic amino acid motif which is also found in the head domains of various intermediate filament proteins and includes a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site. By multiple alignment to all known IF protein sequences, the filensin rod, which is the shortest among IF proteins, can be subdivided into three subdomains (coils 1 a, 1 b, and 2). A 29 amino acid truncation in the coil 2 region accounts for the smaller size of this domain. The filensin tail contains 6 1 / 2 tandem repeats which match analogous motifs of mammalian neurofilament M and H proteins. We suggest that filensin is a novel IF protein which does not conform to any of the previously described classes. Purified filensin fails to form regular filaments in vitro (<b>Merdes,</b> A., M. Brunkener, H. Horstmann, and S. D. Georgatos. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115 : 397 - 410), probably due to the missing segment in the coil 2 region. Participation of filensin in a filamentous network in vivo may be facilitated by an assembly partner...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that discrete foci {{are present in}} the nuclei of mammalian cells in which each of the U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6, and U 5 snRNPs involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and the non-snRNP-splicing factor U 2 AF, are concentrated (Carmo-Fonseca, M., D.

Pepperkok, B. S. Sproat, W. Ansorge, M. S. Swanson, and A. I. Lamond. 1991 EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 10 : 1863 - 1873). Here, we identify these snRNP-rich organelles as coiled bodies. snRNPs no longer concentrate in coiled bodies after cells are treated with the transcription inhibitors alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D. snRNP association with coiled bodies is also disrupted by heat shock. This indicates that the association of snRNPs with coiled bodies may be connected with the metabolism of nascent transcripts. A novel labeling method is described which shows both the RNA and protein components of individual snRNPs colocalizing in situ. Using this procedure all spliceosomal snRNPs are seen distributed in a nonhomogeneous pattern throughout the nucleoplasm, excluding nucleoli. They are most concentrated in coiled bodies, but in addition are present in "speckled" structures which are distinct from coiled bodies and which contain the non-snRNP splicing factor SC- 35. U 1 snRNP shows a more widespread nucleoplasmic staining, outside of coiled bodies and "speckled" structures, relative to the other snRNPs. The association of snRNPs with "speckles" is disrupted by heat shock but enhanced when cells are treated with alpha-amanitin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} studies we have characterized a lens-specific intermediate filament (IF) protein, termed filensin. Filensin does not self-assemble into regular IFs but {{is known to}} associate with another 47 -kD lensspecific protein which has been suggested to represent its assembly partner. To address this possibility, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA coding for the bovine 47 -kD protein which we have termed phakinin (from the greek ~baro ~ = phakos = lens). The predicted sequence comprises 406 amino acids and shows significant similarity (31. 3 % identity over 358 residues) to type I cytokeratins. Phakinin possesses a 95 -residue, non-helical domain (head) and a 311 amino acid long a-helical domain punctuated with heptad repeats (rod). Similar to cytokeratin 19, phakinin lacks a COOH-terminal tail domain and it therefore represents the second known example of a naturally tailless IF protein. Confocal microscopy on frozen lens sections reveals that phakinin colocalizes with filensin and is distributed along the periphery of T HE eye lens represents a transparent and avascular tissue which contains two cell populations: (a) cuboidal epithelial cells organized as a monolayer at the anterior surface of the organ; and (b) elongated lens fiber cells (LFCs) t arranged in concentric layers and extending from the anterior to the posterior surface of the organ. The LFCs originate from the lens epithelium. Upon further differentiation, they acquire a hexahedral shape, develop an extensive system of intercellular junctions, accumulate crystallins, and lose their nuclei. The cytoskeleton and the membrane-skeleton of the cortical LFCs contain certain "generic" components, such as actin, vimentin, fodrin, and A, <b>Merdes</b> and E Gounari contributed equally to this work.

40|$|Cu In,Ga S 2 {{thin films}} {{prepared}} by {{rapid thermal processing}} of metallic precursors yielded solar cells with efficiencies reaching 12. 9 [1]. A good short circuit current density was observed together with open circuit voltages up to 850 mV. However, the fill factor was close, but typically not exceeding, 70 [2]. The dark jV curve shows a distinct two diode behavior which was not previously observed in CuIn Ga S 2 based cells. It is conceivable that this contributes to the non optimum fill factor. Furthermore, {{results suggest that the}} photocurrent is voltage dependent, i. e. non optimum transport of the photocurrent. Process control of the buffer layer preparation suggests different absorber surface properties, compared to the Ga free reference, and the need to re adjust cell preparation parameters in order to fully exploit the efficiency potential of the absorber layers. This implies that the interface plays a significant role for photocurrent transport. In this contribution, in addition to the straightforward approach of quantifying the effects of CdS deposition parameters, the problem is addressed using device modeling and careful surface and interface analyses. Cu In,Ga S 2 surfaces are analyzed using near edge X ray absorption fine structure NEXAFS for the conduction band edge CBE and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy UPS for the valence band edge VBE. The correlation between absorber structure, buffer layer properties and cell performance is discussed. [1] S. <b>Merdes,</b> R. Kaigawa, J. Klaer, R. Klenk, R. Mainz, A. Meeder, N. Papathanasiou, D.
