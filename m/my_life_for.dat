5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

500|$|In late 1891 Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, {{was engaged}} to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia.

[...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910.

500|$|In September 2010, it was {{announced}} Weinberg would {{not be part of}} the show, now named Conan; Jimmy Vivino took over leadership of that band, with Wormworth replacing Weinberg full-time on drums. The split was stated as being mutual, with O'Brien saying, [...] "Max has been a huge part of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> the past 17 years and he is an incredible bandleader and musician," [...] and Weinberg thanking his band and saying, [...] "17 years – a lifetime on TV ... my association with Conan, his staff, and crew has been a deeply rewarding experience for me." [...] Weinberg subsequently acknowledged that [...] "we both wanted to go in different directions," [...] but both looked forward to Weinberg occasionally stopping by to sit in on the new show. Weinberg said his health was better than ever but that the [...] "life-changing experience emotionally and spiritually" [...] of the surgery, a desire to remain in New Jersey with his family, and an interest in exploring new musical directions had all played a role in his departure from O'Brien.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury [...] {{continued}} his private campaigns in [...] parliament, saying [...] "I intend on every occasion to... hinder {{the progress of}} business". In April 1926 he and 12 other opposition MPs prevented {{a vote in the}} House of Commons by obstructing the voting lobbies; they were temporarily suspended by the Speaker. During frequent clashes in the House with Neville Chamberlain, the [...] Minister of Health responsible for Poor Law administration and reform, Lansbury referred to the [...] "Ministry of Death", and called the minister a [...] "pinchbeck Napoleon". However, within the Labour Party itself, Lansbury's status and popularity led to his election as the party's chairman (a largely titular office) in 1927–28. [...] Lansbury also became president of the International League Against Imperialism, where among his fellow executive members were Jawaharlal Nehru, Mme. Sun Yat-sen and Albert Einstein. In 1928, short of money following the failure of the family business, Lansbury published his autobiography, <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> <b>for</b> which he received what he termed [...] "a fairly generous cheque" [...] from the publishers, Constable & Co.|$|E

His brother Blake became an artist involved in the early New York hip hop scene, and his sister Mara became a photographer, writer, and translator. The family lived in a commune in the pre-gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood of North Gowanus (now called Boerum Hill). Despite the racial tensions and conflicts, he later described his bohemian childhood as [...] "thrilling" [...] and culturally wide-reaching. He gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the music of Bob Dylan, saw Star Wars twenty-one times during its original theatrical release, and read the complete works of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Lethem later said Dick’s work was [...] "as formative an influence as marijuana or punk rock—as equally responsible for beautifully fucking up <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>for</b> bending it irreversibly along a course I still travel." ...|$|E
