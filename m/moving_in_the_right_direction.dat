Commentators, including Gene Kerrigan and Vincent Browne, questioned its significance to the Irish economy, and many viewed it as a cosmetic public relations exercise. On 13 March 2013, Ireland managed to regain complete lending access on financial markets, when it successfully issued €5bn of 10-year maturity bonds at a yield of 4.3%. After having ended its bailout programme as scheduled in December 2013, {{there was no need for}} additional bailout support.|$|E

25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E

500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Of key {{important}} to Okabayashi's approach was a traditional concept of movement common to most koryū styles but {{not present in}} the teachings of most contemporary Daitō-ryū teachers. This concept was called 'hitoemi', and describes an idiosyncratic movement, readily seen in any Japanese period drama or koryū art, where the warrior class walk and perform techniques while lining their bodies up 'on one line' as they move forward. Okabayashi during his lengthy morning sessions acting uke, or receiver of techniques for Takeda noticed that his movements always seem to conform to this principle while other teachers, even {{those who had been}} taught by Tokimune did not always move so. When he asked the headmaster about this he reputedly replied obliquely saying [...] "The secret of Daitō-ryū {{is to be found in}} our sword. Study the sword movements and you will find the answers.

Chamberlain's further explanation about why Warren was in that position seemed to calm Sheridan at the time. Warren thought he was doing what he should to be sure that disengagement of his corps in close contact with the enemy was made carefully. Sheridan instructed Griffin to place his men [...] south of J. Boisseau's farm, while Ayres's remained [...] south of Griffin. Crawford's division arrived soon thereafter. After seeing Crawford off and checking for any men or wagons not <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> Warren and his staff then rode to join Griffin at about 9:00a.m. Meanwhile, Griffin had met Devin's cavalry division at J.

The Native Americans set fire to the prairie and began using the smoke for cover as their attacks intensified. Wright now turned east-northeast to the Spokane River where, with the water at his back, he could more effectively concentrate his fire and protect his men. To clear the way, Wright ordered Mullan and his 30 Niimíipu scouts to race through the smoke and scout the land ahead to ensure the column was <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> They did so repeatedly for the next eight hours. [...] To protect the column as it moved, Wright ordered three companies to move forward in a skirmish line to the front and right, breaking up the Indian attacks. They were followed by Wright's cavalry, which charged into the disordered enemy and scattered the warriors. Whenever Native Americans attempted to regroup in the forest to Wright's left, the howitzers and cannon would rake the trees. By nightfall, the column had reached the river and the Native American combatants had fled.
