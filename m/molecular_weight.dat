What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth.

5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E

25|$|While {{inert gas}} reduces {{filament}} evaporation, it also conducts {{heat from the}} filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher.

25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> distribution {{consists of}} several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed.

The higher <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance.

40|$|By {{the use of}} a rat IgG {{monoclonal}} antibody (mab), a mouse mab and human serum containing an IgM mab, all of which react with isolated human myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) on immunoblots and bind only to proteins with relative mobilities identical to MAG and dMAG on immunoblots of homogenates of adult human spinal cord, we demonstrated the following: in homogenates of central nervous system tissue from human fetuses of gestational ages that antedate myelination, the anti- MAG antibodies react only with proteins with <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of 250, 000 or larger. During myelination the <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of proteins with which the anti-MAG antibodies react shift towards the lower <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> found in adult myelin.

25|$|The viral {{thymidine}} kinases differ completely {{from the}} mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors {{that do not}} inhibit the mammalian enzymes. The genes of the two human isoenzymes were localized in the mid-1970s. The gene for TK1 was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding protein has a <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of about 25 kD. Normally, it occurs in tissue as a dimer with a <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of around 50 kD. It can be activated by ATP.

25|$|Metallocene {{polyethylene}} (PE-M) {{is prepared}} {{by means of}} metallocene catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> distribution, exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E
25|$|The diverse {{material}} behavior {{of different types}} of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. <b>Molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and crystallinity are having the biggest impact, the crystallinity in turn depends on <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. The crystallinity is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within crystallites polyethylene has a density of 1.0nbsp&g·cm−3, in the amorphous regions of 0.86nbsp&g·cm−3. Thus, an almost linear relationship exists between density and crystallinity.|$|E
