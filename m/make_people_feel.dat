They're not so busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E

He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
25|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} that infrasound may cause feelings of awe or fear in humans. It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, it may <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place. Engineer Vic Tandy provided such an explanation in his investigations in the 1980s. Tandy, while working in his laboratory, started to feel uneasy and as if a supernatural presence was with him. Later, he could attribute these feelings to a broken metal fan that was causing noises of a frequency that triggered them. The noise could not be perceived by the human ear, but Tandy's body reacted to the 19Hz sounds.|$|E

25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E
500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> bad." ...|$|E

The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.

5000|$|Lyrically, Something Worth Saving {{seems to}} be {{inspired}} by a girl (evidenced by songs like “Kite Like Girl,” “You Make My Heart Sing Louder,” and “Making Love With the Radio On”). When an interviewer from BUILD Series in New York asked Gavin how life was going after jokingly listing track names from the album, Degraw answered “I know some people, they like to make music that is strictly sexy. Some <b>people</b> like to <b>make</b> stuff that sounds {{a little bit more}} aggressive. I like pretty music, and I like music that <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> uplifted and empowered. I think that <b>people</b> need to <b>feel</b> empowered and (love) <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> empowered. So for the most part, that’s the type of thing I enjoy writing about. I enjoy writing about something that <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> like things are going their way rather than being in their way.” [...] Understandably, Degraw is known for being tight-lipped about his relationships or his social life in public. You don’t hear him speak about much other than his music. So even if there was a girl who inspired this album, {{it would be difficult to}} know. There is a track on the album called “Annalee” about a mystery girl whose “eyes are bright as chandeliers” and “got them falling from the roof hypnotized and paralyzed” but there has been no answer as to who Annalee is. Of all the rumors about Degraw’s romantic life, none have been confirmed by him over the years.|$|R
500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> uneasy." ...|$|E
500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{were two}} of the first three games Ubisoft {{released}} for the My Coach series; the other game was My Word Coach.

Ubisoft announced {{the creation of a new}} division to create the My Coach series on May 21, 2007, and that Pauline Jacquey, the producer of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Rayman series, would lead the division. When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series, Jacquey said that she was [...] "developing projects that <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that playing games is worth their while, allowing them to spend quality time with family and friends, learn a new skill, or improve their daily lives". Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that, “The timing is right for us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn, grow and feel better in an entertaining way". All three games were released on November 6, 2007 in North America. Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach, releasing it in North America on October 7, 2008; Wii versions of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30, 2007. The European releases for My French Coach, titled My French Coach Level 1: Beginners, and My Spanish Coach, renamed My Spanish Coach Level 1: Beginners, were accompanied by My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, the next games in the series.|$|E

From her personal experience, what older generations of African Americans had endured had to be put into historical context to be fully understood as the silent, courageous resistance that it was. She then decided to create a present-day character and send her (originally it was a him) back to slavery to explore how hard it would be for a modern person to survive in such harsh conditions.

40|$|Being out of {{the loop}} is a form of partial ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they are {{out of the}} loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations of being {{out of the loop}} on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> worse or whether being familiar <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> better. This study also looked at whether people need to be told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether the feeling of failure associated with feeling out of the loop can be eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions of being out of the loop on pop culture: who people are out of the loop from, what people are out of the loop on, and when people are out of the loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when out of the loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> better 2) failure and feeling out of the loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless of who they are out of the loop from, what they are out of the loop on, and when they are out of the loop.

For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that [...] "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.".
