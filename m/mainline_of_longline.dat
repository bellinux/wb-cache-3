40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fishing {{can be understood}} as a case study of the cultural, economic, environmental and social impacts of unsustainable fishing technology. While much attention has been attributed to the impact <b>of</b> industrial <b>longlines</b> on the marine ecosystem, {{little is known about the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing on local food security, employment, cultural belief systems and traditions, revenue generation from marine tourism and climate change. New data demonstrate that the contributions of Marine Protected Areas, marine tourism and recreational fishing to local coastal economies dwarf the contributions <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing. When combined with the impact of overfishing on coastal fishing communities and fish consumers, policies promoting sustainable fisheries must be expanded to take these other factors into account along with issues <b>of</b> biodiversity. <b>Longline</b> fishing Sea turtles Recreational fishing Marine tourism...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{and deep}} sea fishing are the main sub sectors of Sri Lankan fishery industry. The deep sea {{fisheries}} in Sri Lanka have been in existence since the early 1980. Sri Lanka coastal fishing sector mainly uses conventional methods with less capital investments. Dispute of this, coastal fish production of Sri Lanka {{is higher than the}} deep sea fish production. Longline and gillnet are the two widely use fishing methods in {{deep sea fishing}} sector. In this paper economic efficiency, Post Harvest Fish Lost (PHFL) <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing are evaluated and identified. Similar evaluation is conducted for gillnet fishing to compare the position <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing in the deep sea fishing sector. Research methodology for economic efficiency and PHFL was developed using the findings of literature survey. Primary data were collected from 150 deep sea vessels operated in Negombo fishery harbour. 3, 346 deep sea fishing vessels are operated in Sri Lanka in the year 2010 according to the fishery statistic 2010, issued by Ministry of fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD). Data collection was done during February through October of 2011 in Negombo fishery harbour. Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) measures the net gain from a capital investment. ARR is use to evaluate and identify the economic efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing and gillnet fishing. To calculate ARR, capital investments, fix costs, variable costs, revenues, number of fishing trips per years are used. Further this paper investigates the trend <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing in the Sri Lanka. Secondary data from MFARD and FAO were used to evaluate and identify the trend. Findings indicate that the ARR for longline fishing are attractive and comparatively higher than gillnet fishing. It is found that PHFL <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> Fishing is very less. PHFL <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing is found as around 12. 5 % of gillnet fishing. Further deep sea fishing sector demonstrates impressive improvement during last few years. Hence the results conclude that high return and high quality standard <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing. This will make longline fishing more popular and attractive in deep sea fishery sector. Further Deep sea fishing will dominate Sri Lanka fishery sector as implied in trend analysis. Hence longline fishing will be very significant in Sri Lanka fishery sector. It is suggested that in order to improve the fisher sector in Sri Lanka, longline fishing should be promoted by placing right credit mechanism to the fishermen, easy and affordable access to modern technology and right infrastructures for longline vessels in fishery harbours...|$|R

Spatial extent of the effects was investigated by comparing the catch rates <b>of</b> <b>longlines</b> set at various distances from the survey tracklines, and duration of the effects was studied by analysing the catch rates <b>of</b> <b>longlines</b> soaked after the sound emissions ended.

40|$|I {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} 11 variables on the catchability <b>of</b> pelagic <b>longlines,</b> which are used to catch tunas and billfishes in the open ocean. Extension of the depth range and the duration <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> operations have reduced the catchability of several epipelagic species, such as mako sharks (Isurus spp.), since industrial longlining commenced in the tropical Pacific Ocean in the early 1950 s. Reductions in the body size of many species also resulted in reduced searching for food and fewer encounters with longline hooks. By contrast, the catchability of commercially valuable species, like bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), increased substantially {{as a result of}} the extension of the depth range <b>of</b> <b>longlines</b> and the longer duration of fishing operations. Stronger and less visible line materials, new bait species, and skipper experience also contributed to increased catchability. Dedicated surveys should be used to obtain fishery independent estimates of abundance. Another option is to use surveys to measure variations in the relationship between longline catch rates and animal abundance...|$|R
