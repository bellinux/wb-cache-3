5|$|The Maldives {{participated in}} eight Summer Olympics between {{its debut in}} the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Maldivians {{participating}} at any single Summer Games was seven at the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea and the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain. No <b>Maldivian</b> has ever won a medal at the Olympics. All of <b>Maldivian</b> participants competed at the Games through universality slots from the International Association of Athletics Federations and FINA. Shajan was chosen to be The Maldives's flag bearer during the parade of nations of the opening ceremony while Ismail bore the flag during the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Maldives competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's eighth {{consecutive}} {{appearance at}} the Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes: Hassan Saaid and Afa Ismail, as well as swimmers Ibrahim Nishwan and Aminath Shajan. Both Shajan and Ismail were returning competitors from the 2012 London Olympics, with the former leading the <b>Maldivian</b> squad as the flag bearer in the opening ceremony. The Maldives, however, has yet to win its first ever Olympic medal.|$|E
5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional <b>Maldivian</b> woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E

The Police tried their best to control the situation, but needed the help of the Military. The Military helped the Police in their full strength and finally brought the situation under control. That was on 15 May 1933.|$|R
25|$|<b>Maldivian</b> mariners {{knew the}} Chagos Islands well. In <b>Maldivian</b> lore, {{they are known}} as Fōlhavahi or Hollhavai (the latter name in the closer Southern Maldives). According to Southern <b>Maldivian</b> oral tradition, traders and {{fishermen}} were occasionally lost at sea and got stranded {{on one of the}} islands of the Chagos. Eventually they were rescued and brought back home. However, these islands were judged to be too far away from the Maldives to be settled permanently by them. Thus, for many centuries the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours.|$|E

25|$|He {{was later}} alleged by the government, to have {{withheld}} {{information about a}} bombing plot. On 8 April 1992, {{he was sentenced to}} three years in prison on that charge. He was released in June 1993, then re-arrested in 1994 and 1995. In 1996 he was sentenced to two years imprisonment for an article he had written about the 1993 and 1994 <b>Maldivian</b> elections, and was again designated a prisoner of conscience. In all, he was arrested more than twenty times during Gayoom's rule, missing the births of both of his daughters. During his time in jail, he spent significant amounts of time studying, producing three books on <b>Maldivian</b> history.|$|E

50|$|<b>Maldivians</b> {{feel some}} {{affinity}} to Northern India through their language, which {{is related to}} the languages of North India. Most older generation or traditional <b>Maldivians</b> like to watch Hindi movies from the 1960s or 70s, and like to listen to the songs of those movies. The reason is that out of a similar language, similar rhythms and cadences develop. In fact, it is very easy for <b>Maldivians</b> to fit local lyrics to a Hindi tune because of this cultural closeness. For example, the Hindi words Ek din ("one day") are changed to E kudin (those kids) in Dhivehi, and in this manner a new local song develops.|$|R
25|$|Mohamed Nazim was {{reported}} to have been arrested and put in protective custody by the <b>Maldivian</b> Police. He later publicly reverted to Islam in custody after receiving two days of counseling by two Islamic scholars, but was held awaiting possible charges.|$|E

25|$|Deep ocean: {{which is}} by far the largest part of the <b>Maldivian</b> EEZ. This area is {{inhabited}} by pelagic fish, small schooling forage fish, sometimes called bait fish, and larger fish who prey on them, such as tuna and shark.

25|$|Acute accents are {{sometimes}} added to loanwords where a final e is not silent, for example, maté from Spanish mate, the <b>Maldivian</b> capital Malé, saké, and Pokémon from the Japanese compound for pocket monster, {{the last three}} from languages which do not use the Roman alphabet, and where transcriptions do not normally use acute accents.|$|E
25|$|As of August 2006, a {{total of}} 584 Twin Otter {{aircraft}} (all variants) remain in service worldwide. Major operators include: Libyan Arab Airlines (16), <b>Maldivian</b> Air Taxi (22), Trans <b>Maldivian</b> Airways (23), Kenn Borek Air (42) and Scenic Airlines (11). Some 115 airlines operate smaller numbers of the aircraft including Yeti Airlines in Nepal, Malaysia Airlines (which uses the Twin Otter exclusively for passenger and freight transportation to the Kelabit Highlands region in Sarawak), and in the United Kingdom, the FlyBe franchise operator Loganair which uses the aircraft to service the island of Barra in the Hebrides islands. This daily scheduled service is unique as the aircraft lands {{on the beach and}} the schedule is partly influenced by the tide tables. Trials in Barra with heavier planes than the Twin Otter, like the Short 360, failed because they sank in the sand. The Twin Otter is also used for landing at the world's shortest commercial runway on the Caribbean island of Saba, Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

50|$|The Maldive atolls {{are part}} of the long {{submerged}} mountain range that extends from the Laccadives, or Lakshadweep, in the north, to the Chagos in the south. Northern <b>Maldivians</b> used to visit often Maliku, Minicoy Island, before the 1960s when it was allowed for them to do so. In fact, Minicoy was called 'Avatteri Maliku', which means 'neighbor Maliku'. But even Northern <b>Maldivians</b> knew little about the Laccadive islands further north.|$|R
50|$|Mahl people {{refers to}} the ethnic <b>Maldivians</b> of India (i.e. People of Minicoy and migrant {{communities}} from Minicoy). They {{are one of the}} three subgroups of the <b>Maldivians</b> and speak the Mahl dialect of Divehi which {{is a member of the}} southern group of Indo-Aryan languages. All Mahls are native to Minicoy Island in the Union territory of Lakshadweep, India, which was formerly a part of the Maldive Islands.|$|R
25|$|Nasheed was {{reported}} to have taken refuge in the Indian High Commission office in Malé in February 2013 after a <b>Maldivian</b> court issued an arrest warrant against him and ordered the police to detain him. On March 2013, he was arrested on the charges of abuse of the office but was released a day later. Numerous stops and starts to his trial followed.|$|E
25|$|One modern {{national}} alphabet {{that has}} not been graphically traced back to the Canaanite alphabet is the <b>Maldivian</b> script, which is unique in that, although it is clearly modeled after Arabic and perhaps other existing alphabets, it derives its letter forms from numerals. Another is the Korean Hangul, which was created independently in 1443. The Osmanya alphabet was devised for Somali in the 1920s by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, and the forms of its consonants appear to be complete innovations.|$|E
25|$|In November 1988 speedboats {{carrying}} 80 armed militants of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam {{landed in}} Maldives {{and along with}} allies who had infiltrated the country, began taking over the government.
