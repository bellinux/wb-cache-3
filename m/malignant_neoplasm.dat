25|$|An {{osteosarcoma}} (OS) or {{osteogenic sarcoma}} (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, {{it is an}} aggressive <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.|$|E
25|$|Seminoma (also {{known as}} pure seminoma or {{classical}} seminoma) is a germ cell tumor of the testicle or, more rarely, the mediastinum or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> {{and is one}} of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.|$|E
25|$|If {{the general}} {{process by which}} {{sporadic}} colon cancers arise is {{the formation of a}} pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm.</b>|$|E
25|$|ICD-10 classifies {{neoplasms}} {{into four}} main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ <b>neoplasms,</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms,</b> and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. <b>Malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> are also simply known as cancers {{and are the}} focus of oncology.|$|R
40|$|Tobacco use and tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> {{are a large}} {{problem and}} {{cause of death in}} the United States. Tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> status varies between sex, race, age group and type of cancer. This essay aims to conduct an {{analysis}} of resident deaths due to tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> in Allegheny County for the year 2012, and to compare them with those for the United States and Pennsylvania. This essay will also include spatial analysis for 2012 and 2013 to show the geographic distribution of eight tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> in Allegheny County in 2012 and 2013. Age-adjusted mortality rates of eight <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> for Allegheny County residents age 25 or older in 2012 were calculated, adjusted for sex and race. These rates were compared with those of the State of Pennsylvania and the United States. Age-adjusted mortality rates of eight <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of all sexes and races in Allegheny County in 2012 and 2013 were calculated, by municipality, to show geographic patterns of tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms.</b> The age-adjusted mortality rates of tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> were similar among Allegheny County, State of Pennsylvania and the United States. The age-adjusted mortality rate of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of trachea, bronchus and lung is the highest in each race and sex groups. In general, males have higher age-adjusted mortality rates of tobacco-related cancers than females, and age-adjusted mortality rates of tobacco-related cancers in blacks are higher than those of whites. Based on spatial analysis, higher mortality rates seem to be concentrated in Pitcairn Borough, Millvale Borough, Etna Borough, Tarentum Borough, which present visible geographic patterns within Allegheny County in 2012 and 2013. These results indicate a need to address and develop tobacco cessation programs to improve policies and public health awareness of tobacco cessation and tobacco-related <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> prevention, and assist with reducing tobacco use and eliminating tobacco-related disease disparities in the population...|$|R

25|$|In every {{surgical}} and non-surgical procedure, {{the risk}} of medical complications exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), {{this is especially true}} in the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complicationsfat necrosis, calcification, and sclerotic noduleswhich directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications (2009), reported that the incidence of medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm3/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with 3-D volumetric and MRI visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and abnormal tissue masses (<b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm).</b> According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat graftsfat necrosis, calcification, hyalinization, and fibroplasia.|$|E

2500|$|Precancer Features of EIN (Table I). The {{cells of}} an EIN lesion are genetically {{different}} than normal and malignant tissues, {{and have a}} distinctive appearance under the light microscope. [...] EIN cells are already neoplastic, demonstrating a monoclonal growth pattern and clonally distributed mutations. [...] Progression of EIN to carcinoma, effectively a conversion from a benign neoplasm to a <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm,</b> is accomplished through acquisition of additional mutations and accompanied by a change in behavior characterized by the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize to regional and distant sites.|$|E
2500|$|Gastric cancer {{develops}} within areas (field defects) of {{the stomach}} with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia: these lesions represent the cancerization ﬁeld in which (intestinal-type) gastric cancers develop. [...] In one study, the field defect was clearly demonstrated in gastric carcinogenesis using miRNA high throughput data from normal gastric mucosa (from patients who {{had never had a}} gastric <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm),</b> non-tumor tissue adjacent to a gastric cancer, and gastric cancer tissue. Greater than 5-fold reductions were found in four miRNAs in tumor-adjacent tissues and gastric cancers as compared to those miRNA levels in normal gastric tissues.|$|E
2500|$|In the colon, a field defect {{probably}} arises {{by natural}} selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells {{at the base of}} one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells {{by natural selection}}. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise. [...] The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. [...] Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> (cancer).|$|E

These neoplasms are also indicated (in the diagram below the photo) by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). [...] The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). [...] The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon. [...] In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.|$|E
