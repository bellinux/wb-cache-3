They produce the widespread, {{noticeable}} defoliation that forest landowners, foresters, and the general public can easily recognize. Classification Forest insect defoliators can be classified or described in several ways: defolia-tion pattern on individual leaves, structures that they create from which to feed, the scientific insect order, and time of the growing season that feeding occurs. Defoliation Pattern Defoliators create many patterns of defoliation on the individual leaf. Some insects completely eat the leaf blade leaving only the large veins. Some create a “shot hole ” pattern by eating holes in the leaf blade. Other insects make “leaf mines ” by eating the middle layer of the leaf. And, one group makes a “skeleton” of the leaf by eating everything but the large and small veins. “Shot hole ” defoliation in sugar maple leaves.
