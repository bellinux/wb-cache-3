500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied. Some women {{admired her}} strength and poise in private matters {{that were made}} public, some sympathized with her {{as a victim of}} her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands <b>me</b> <b>better</b> and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power, Marcus Reeves said that Fear of a Black Planet [...] "was {{as much a}} musical assault on America's racism {{as it was a}} call to blacks to {{effectively}} react to it". According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won't screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand <b>me</b> <b>better</b> and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira {{felt it was}} {{something}} she had not [...] "tapped into {{for the past three}} years," [...] and its inclusion in the album resulted in [...] "very intense, very romantic" [...] songs. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] is one such song from the album. The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar. According to Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily, its [...] "softer" [...] production helps in putting the focus on Shakira's voice, which she opined had been [...] "stripped to its sensitive core." [...] The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of [...] "longing, regrets and loneliness." [...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it's right there in the songs. I've decided that I'm not going to explain every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain <b>me</b> <b>better</b> than I can explain them." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know <b>me</b> <b>better</b> now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E

His emphasis on cooking fresh, nutritious food continued as he created Jamie's Ministry of Food, a television series where Oliver travelled to inspire everyday people in Rotherham, Yorkshire, to cook healthy meals. Another television series is Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution (2010–11), where he travelled first to Huntington, West Virginia and then to Los Angeles {{to change the way}} Americans eat, and address their dependence on fast food.|$|E
2500|$|Unitas {{actively}} {{lobbied for}} another NFL team {{to come to}} Baltimore. After the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996 and changed their name to the Ravens, Unitas {{and some of the}} other old-time Colts attended the Ravens' first game ever against the Raiders on Opening Day at Memorial Stadium. Unitas was frequently seen on the Ravens' sidelines at home games (most prominently in 1998 when the now-Indianapolis Colts played the Ravens) and received a thunderous ovation every time he was pictured on each of the huge widescreens at M Bank Stadium. He was often seen on the 30-yard line on the Ravens side. When the NFL celebrated its first 50 years, Unitas was voted the league's best player. Retired Bears quarterback Sid Luckman said of Unitas, [...] "He was better than <b>me,</b> <b>better</b> than Sammy Baugh, better than anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows <b>me</b> <b>better</b> than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E

2500|$|Strait {{began the}} decade {{with the release}} of his tenth studio album, Livin' It Up, which {{featured}} two No.1 hits including [...] "Love Without End, Amen", his first multi-week hit, and [...] "I've Come to Expect It From You". Both songs remained No.1 for five weeks in 1990. Chill of an Early Fall shortly followed in 1991, and received positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly noted that the album marked a shift for Strait from [...] "repeating himself" [...] in his previous works to producing different material. It produced the No.1's [...] "If I Know Me" [...] and [...] "You Know <b>Me</b> <b>Better</b> Than That", but ended his streak of 31 straight top ten hits with the cover of [...] "Lovesick Blues", which peaked at No.24. The record blocked his run of eight top charting albums with its peak of No.4. In the spring of 1992, Holding My Own was released. It did not produce any No.1s but did include two top five songs including [...] "So Much Like My Dad".|$|E

[...] Rettig later recalled, [...] "...I was called in for an interview. At that time I was screen-tested, I read for the part and evidently I impressed some people.

[...] So the decision as to who got the role was essentially left up to Lassie...I spent a week with Rudd [...] and Lassie out in North Hollywood at the Weatherwax's home. The other finalists did, too. [...] The fact was that Lassie liked <b>me</b> <b>better</b> than he did the other two kids. I loved animals, and this seemed to be very important to Rudd, too." ...|$|E

[...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge."
