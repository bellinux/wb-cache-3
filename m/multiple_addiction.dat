50|$|Addiction {{recovery}} {{groups are}} voluntary associations {{of people who}} share a common desire to overcome drug addiction. Different groups use different methods, ranging from completely secular to explicitly spiritual. Some programs may advocate {{a reduction in the}} use of illegal drugs rather than outright abstention, although this is typically not a sustainable treatment plan in the long term. One survey of members found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety. The survey found group participation increased when the individual members' beliefs matched those of their primary support group (often people will be members of <b>multiple</b> <b>addiction</b> recovery groups). Analysis of the survey results found a significant positive correlation between the religiosity of members and their participation in twelve-step addiction recovery groups and SMART Recovery, although the correlation factor was three times smaller for SMART Recovery than for the twelve-step addiction recovery groups. Religiosity was inversely related to participation in Secular Organizations for Sobriety.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} The aims {{of this study}} were (a)  to {{describe}} the prevalence of single versus <b>multiple</b> <b>addiction</b> problems in a large representative sample and (b)  to identify distinct subgroups of people experiencing substance-related and behavioral addiction problems. Methods A random sample of 6, 000 respondents from Alberta, Canada, completed survey items assessing self-attributed problems experienced in the past year with four substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cocaine) and six behaviors (gambling, eating, shopping, sex, video gaming, and work). Hierarchical cluster analyses were used to classify patterns of co-occurring addiction problems on an analytic subsample of 2, 728 respondents (1, 696 women and 1032 men; M age [*]=[*] 45. 1 years, SD age [*]=[*] 13. 5 years) who reported problems with {{one or more of the}} addictive behaviors in the previous year. Results In the total sample, 49. 2 % of the respondents reported zero, 29. 8 % reported one, 13. 1 % reported two, and 7. 9 % reported three or more addiction problems in the previous year. Cluster-analytic results suggested a 7 -group solution. Members of most clusters were characterized by <b>multiple</b> <b>addiction</b> problems; the average number of past year addictive behaviors in cluster members ranged between 1 (Cluster II: excessive eating only) and 2. 5 (Cluster VII: excessive video game playing with the frequent co-occurrence of smoking, excessive eating and work). Discussion and conclusions Our findings replicate previous results indicating that about half of the adult population struggles with at least one excessive behavior in a given year; however, our analyses revealed a higher number of co-occurring addiction clusters than typically found in previous studies...|$|E

Methods The present study investigated {{use of a}} matrix measure approach among former alternative high school youth (average age = 19. 8 years) at risk for addictions. Lifetime and last 30 -day prevalence {{of one or more}} of 11 addictions reviewed in other work (Sussman, Lisha & Griffiths, 2011) was the primary focus (i. e., cigarettes, alcohol, other/hard drugs, eating, gambling, Internet, shopping, love, sex, exercise, and work). Also, the co-occurrence of two or more of these 11 addictive behaviors was investigated. Finally, the latent class structure of these addictions, and their associations with other measures, was examined. Results We found that ever and last 30 -day prevalence of {{one or more of these}} addictions was 79. 2 % and 61. 5 %, respectively. Ever and last 30 -day co-occurrence of two or more of these addictions was 61. 5 % and 37. 7 %, respectively. Latent Class Analysis suggested two groups: a generally Non-addicted Group (67. 2 % of the sample) and a “Work Hard, Play Hard”-addicted Group that was particularly invested in addiction to love, sex, exercise, the Internet, and work. Supplementary analyses suggested that the single-response type self-reports may be measuring the addictions they intend to measure. Discussion and Conclusions We suggest implications of these results for future studies and the development of prevention and treatment programs, though much more validation research is needed on the use of this type of measure...|$|R

40|$|Substance {{dependence}} or {{addiction is}} a complex environmental and genetic disorder that results in serious health and socio-economic consequences. Multiple substance dependence categories together, rather than any one individual addiction outcome, may explain the genetic variability of such disorder. In our study, we defined a composite substance dependence phenotype derived from six individual diagnoses: addiction to nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates or other drugs as a whole. Using data from several genomewide case-control studies, we identified a strong (Odds ratio  =  1. 77) and significant (p-value =  7 E- 8) association signal with a novel gene, PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 2 (PKNOX 2), on chromosome 11 with the composite phenotype in European-origin women.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and pathological profile of young patients with {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of tongue. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised record of patients 20. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 17 (58. 6 %) were men and 12 (41. 3 %) were women. The overall mean age at presentation was 29. 6 +/- 4. 4 years. All patients (100 %) {{had some sort of}} addiction, with 15 (51. 7 %) having more than one addiction. Of the total, 20 (68. 9 %) patients had moderately differentiated carcinoma. At presentation, 20 (68. 9 %) had advanced stage (III-IV) disease. Surgery was the primary modality used in all the patients (100 %). Median follow-up period was 36 months (range: 1 - 6 years).

40|$|Aims : Explore {{client and}} staff {{views of the}} most and least useful aspects of {{residential}} rehabilitation. Methods : A qualitative study, involving interviews with clients who had attended residential rehabilitation {{and a range of}} relevant staff, conducted in the Wiltshire and Swindon areas of the UK. Findings : All interviewees agreed there were many benefits to be gained from Residential Rehabilitation. There was considerable diversity of clients' experiences of the help provided to them in the community, and most criticism was reserved for what happened before and after residential rehabilitation. Conclusions : Arrangements for care need to be considered before admission, not just before discharge, taking a comprehensive holistic approach to client needs, including childcare, housing, training and education, employment, family and relationship concerns. This implies skilled key‐working, effective inter‐agency collaboration and the setting of clear standards of quality.

40|$|Addiction {{to drugs}} {{is a widely}} {{acknowledged}} problem in South Africa. Newer developments {{in the study of}} addiction include behaviours such as gambling and sex {{as part of a broader}} syndrome. International research has established that most people with one addiction are at risk for co-occurring addictions which are frequently undiagnosed and untreated. <b>Multiple</b> <b>addictions</b> (MA) have been shown to combine in specific patterns to produce addiction interaction disorder (AID) resulting in a more complex, treatment- resistant illness. This was the first study South Africa to investigate if people with substance use disorders had other addictions. The research had three aims: to establish if in-patients admitted to three drug rehabilitation centres had other addictions, to investigate the extent of the MA and AID and to determine whether the treatment programmes managed them appropriately. The study employed the mixed methods research design and was located at three in-patient facilities in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. During the first phase, discussion groups were held with professionals that explored their perceptions of MA, AID and current treatment programmes.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between drug use and adherence to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) among HIV-positive people, with two alternative measures of drug use: a set of drug uses considered independent and patterns capturing combinations of drug uses. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey conducted among a nationally representative sample of 4963 HIV-positive people randomly recruited in 102 French hospital departments delivering HIV care. The researchers modelled non-adherence to HAART with a set of binary indicators of drug use (model I) or comprehensive patterns obtained with a cluster analysis (model II). RESULTS: In model 1, heroin use, injection drug use, and cocaine/amphetamine/ecstasy use were not significant predictors of poor adherence in contrast with nicotine dependence, cannabis use, and amyl nitrate use. In model II, non-adherence to HAART was more prevalent among profiles characterised by alcohol abuse and <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions,</b> including nicotine dependence and use of various illicit drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine dependence, cannabis use, and amyl nitrate use are associated with non-adherence only if they are embedded in drug use patterns characterised by alcohol abuse or heroin use. The results also illustrate the interest in investigating the effects of drug use patterns on behavioural outcomes, rather than measuring independent effects of various drug use indicators that are highly correlated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} framework by way of exploring addiction interaction in terms of addressing the following key ques-tions: What happens when a patient population of sex addicts is as-sessed for other comorbid disorders? What conceptual foundations might we look to in terms of possible etiology and clinical inter-vention? Are there ways these addictions interact making the whole {{more than just the}} “sum ” of the addictions themselves? Can we ex-plain these interactions from what is known from neurobiology? Finally, are these interactions comprehensible to patients? In order for the paradigm to be useful to patients, they {{have to be able to}} recognize them. Clinicians who achieve a basic understanding of addiction interactions and relevant neurobiological background will be in a better position to serve the needs of their client. The emerging understanding of sex addiction as a mental health problem has paralleled a growing acceptance of <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions,</b> including both chemical and behavioral addictions. Some researchers have noticed how these extreme behaviors would be “balanced ” by extreme deprivation or avoidance behaviors. Thus from a treatment perspective, clinicians have long noted that sex addiction was woven into an intricate web of addictions, compulsions, and avoidance strategies. Across the behaviors one is struck by how both polythetic and monothetic characteristics coexist. That is, each addiction or deprivation/avoidance has not only unique qualities but also remarkably similar characteristics. Thus the same patterns of loss of contro...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{extension}} of the rational addictions model does away with the two main criticisms brought against this model in the literature. Simply allow-ing {{for more than one}} addictive good or habit in the utility function allows the model, first, to generate any type of cyclical patterns in consumption (damped, explosive, or persistent) under no special conditions and, second, to generate both abrupt and smooth decisions to cessate strong addictions. Thus, this in-nocuous {{extension of}} the model is able to explain the observed relapses, binges, and episodic consumption of addictive goods. Empirically, <b>multiple</b> habits and <b>addictions</b> would seem to be the rule rather than the exception. Yet, theoreti-cally and empirically each addiction has been treated individually in most of the literature. <b>Multiple</b> habits and <b>addictions</b> also have fundamental implications for drug policy analysis, the theory of consumption with habit persistence, and the econometric specification of empirical models of addiction. ∗I am indebted for helpful comments to Harl Ryder and Ana I.

40|$|Background and Aims Recent {{work has}} studied addictions using a matrix measure, which taps <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions</b> through single {{responses}} for each type. This {{is the first}} longitudinal study using a matrix measure. Methods We investigated {{the use of this}} approach among former alternative high school youth (average age = 19. 8 years at baseline; longitudinal n = 538) at risk for addictions. Lifetime and last 30 -day prevalence of one or more of 11 addictions reviewed in other work was the primary focus (i. e., cigarettes, alcohol, hard drugs, shopping, gambling, Internet, love, sex, eating, work, and exercise). These were examined at two time-points one year apart. Latent class and latent transition analyses (LCA and LTA) were conducted in Mplus. Results Prevalence rates were stable across the two time-points. As in the cross-sectional baseline analysis, the 2 -class model (addiction class, non-addiction class) fit the data better at follow-up than models with more classes. Item-response or conditional probabilities for each addiction type did not differ between time-points. As a result, the LTA model utilized constrained the conditional probabilities to be equal across the two time-points. In the addiction class, larger conditional probabilities (i. e., 0. 40 – 0. 49) were found for love, sex, exercise, and work addictions; medium conditional probabilities (i. e., 0. 17 – 0. 27) were found for cigarette, alcohol, other drugs, eating, Internet and shopping addiction; and a small conditional probability (0. 06) was found for gambling. Discussion and Conclusions Persons in an addiction class tend to remain in this addiction class over a one-year period. ...|$|R

The suit settled for an undisclosed amount in December 2012. A 2004 state suit against the school had been dismissed due to the statute of limitations, but U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Block subsequently ruled that portions of the suit could proceed in federal court because administrators may have lied about when they learned of the abuse. Plaintiffs' attorney Kevin Mulhearn cited the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in alleging that past and current administrators engaged in a coverup of the abuse.

The present paper briefly re-views earlier reports in this area and describes eighteen cases with parenteral Pentazocine abuse seen in a general ho-spital of Delhi over a short period of time. These cases form a spectrum from isolated abuse in patients with chronic-pain to Pentazocine being just another drug in the setting of <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions.</b> Recommendat ion is made for more judicious use of Pentazocine in view of its high dependence potential. History of Medicine is replete with examples of substances which were in-troduced as harmless drugs, but later proved to have considerable abuse and de-pendence potential. Heroin and Pethidine are two well known drugs of this type. With the introduction {{of a large number of}} synthetic and semisynthetic opiate congen-ers the chances of such pharmaceutical mis-adventures have increased substantially. Fuller realization of the abuse potential of a drug frequently comes after it has been used for a number of years or even decades.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to further an {{understanding}} of eating disorders in men. The intention was {{to contribute to the}} literature on this subject by providing a forum where men with body image and/or eating disorders could openly and candidly tell their stories. [...] A qualitative research approach was utilized by conducting a series of semi-structured, individual interviews with a variety of men, 18 years of age and older. Paramount in this group were men who had disclosed eating disorders and who have initiated a recovery process. Focus was also given to men who expressed concern over body image and masculinity. Interviews were audio-taped and then transcribed. Candidates were obtained from referrals by counsellors, and word-of-mouth procedures with each participant giving prior permission for the referral. Consent forms were signed and anonymity offered via pseudonyms. [...] The thesis is organized into three sections. Part One examines the changing attitudes of men towards eating, body image, and masculinity. It includes findings {{from a wide variety of}} sources, providing insight into society's evolving messages to males. It examines some of the reasons why men with eating disorders are hesitant to seek help and often fail to identify their condition. It also examines the escalating pressure on males to adopt unrealistic body images as portrayed in contemporary media. [...] Part Two, the core of the thesis, gives voice to the men who, with eloquence, shared their struggles with these issues. It explores the diversity of symptoms and behaviours experienced by these men, many of which challenge conventional stereotypes of eating disorders. It examines a variety of topics that the men identified, including: <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions,</b> sexual abuse, compulsive exercise, early rejection from peers and role models, and a poorly defined sense of masculinity. [...] The third and final section sheds a brief light on the individual recovery process, as experienced by the men who shared their stories in Part Two. It explores their attempts to find self acceptance by adopting healthier definitions of masculinity, separate from their addiction and pain. [...] Interestingly, all the men who were approached for the study were eager to participate and told their stories, some for the first time, with remarkable candour. While men are often alleged to be disconnected from their feelings, all of the men who were interviewed spoke of a long history of having access to, and an awareness of wide spectrum of emotions with an amazing repertoire of vocabulary to verbalize them...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS. Based on neurochemical {{and genetic}} evidence, {{we suggest that}} both {{prevention}} and treatment of <b>multiple</b> <b>addictions,</b> such as dependence to alcohol, nicotine and glucose, should involve a biphasic approach. Thus, acute treatment should consist of preferential blocking of postsynaptic Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) dopamine receptors (D 1 -D 5), whereas long term activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system should involve activation and/or release of Dopamine (DA) at the NAc site. Failure to do so will result in abnormal mood, behavior and potential suicide ideation. Individuals possessing a paucity of serotonergic and/or dopaminergic receptors, and an increased rate of synaptic DA catabolism due to high catabolic genotype of the COMT gene, are predisposed to self-medicating any substance or behavior that will activate DA release, including alcohol, opiates, psychostimulants, nicotine, gambling, sex, and even	excessive internet gaming. Acute utilization of these substances and/or stimulatory behaviors induces a feeling of well being. Unfortunately, sustained and prolonged abuse leads to a toxic" pseudo feeling" of well being resulting in tolerance and disease or discomfort. Thus, a reduced number of DA receptors, due to carrying the DRD 2 A 1 allelic genotype, results in excessive craving behavior; whereas a normal or sufficient amount of DA receptors results in low craving behavior. In terms of preventing substance abuse, one goal would be to induce a proliferation of DA D 2 receptors in genetically prone individuals. While in vivo experiments using a typical D 2 receptor agonist induce down regulation, experiments in vitro have shown that constant stimulation of the DA receptor system via a known D 2 agonist results in significant proliferation of D 2 receptors in spite of genetic antecedents. In essence, D 2 receptor stimulation signals negative feedback mechanisms in the mesolimbic system to induce mRNA expression causing proliferation of D 2 receptors. PROPOSAL AND CONCLUSION. The authors propose that D 2 receptor stimulation can be accomplished via the use of Synapatmine™, a natural but therapeutic nutraceutical formulation that potentially induces DA release, causing the same induction of D 2 -directed mRNA and thus proliferation of D 2 receptors in the human. This proliferation of D 2 receptors in turn will induce the attenuation of craving behavior. In fact as mentioned earlier, this model has been proven in research showing DNA-directed compensatory overexpression (a form of gene therapy) of the DRD 2 receptors, resulting in {{a significant reduction in}} alcohol craving behavior in alcohol preferring rodents. Utilizing natural dopaminergic repletion therapy to promote long term dopaminergic activation will ultimately lead to a common, safe and effective modality to treat Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) behaviors including Substance Use Disorders (SUD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Obesity and other reward deficient aberrant behaviors. This concept is further supported by the more comprehensive understanding of the role of dopamine in the NAc as a "wanting" messenger in the meso-limbic DA system.

40|$|Abstract — Aims:Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is {{of great}} clinical importance {{not only because of}} its high preva-lence but also due to the frequent comorbid illnesses that are connected with this disorder. Several studies were able to demonstrate that ADHD constitutes a significant risk factor for the exacerbation of habit-forming illnesses, i. e. addictions. Methods: We conducted a study on 152 adult patients with alcohol dependence (n = 91) or <b>multiple</b> substance <b>addiction</b> (n = 61) {{to determine whether or not}} these patients were affected by ADHD. For retrospective assessment of childhood ADHD, the WURS-k was used as well as the DSM-IV symptom checklist for ADHD. The CAARS was used to assess the persisting symptoms of ADHD in adults. Results: 20. 9 % (WURS-k) or 23. 1 % (DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) of the alcohol-dependent patients showed evidence of retrospective ADHD affliction in child-hood. With the help of CAARS, ADHD was proved to be persistent in 33. 3 % of the adult patients. In the group of substance-addicted patients 50. 8 % (WURS-k) and 54. 1 % (DSM-IV) presented with diagnostic criteria for ADHD in childhood and 65. 5 % (CAARS) showed evidence of ADHD persisting in adulthood. Conclusions: These results reveal that habit-forming illnesses can be associated with a high comorbidity with ADHD, expressed in the form of alcohol abuse and also in consumption of illegal drugs. The results underline the great importance of early and adequate diagnostics and therapy of ADHD for the prevention of habit-forming illnesses...|$|R
