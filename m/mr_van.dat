5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's owner, Dee Garrett, bred {{her to his}} {{champion}} stallion Vandy, {{and produced}} three world champions: Vandy's Flash, Vanetta Dee, and Vannevar. Vansarita Too set a new track record and Vandy's Betty and Miss Vanity earned AAA speed ratings. Her first foal was Vandy's Betty, {{who went on to}} earn an AAA rating on the race track and became the dam of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Van</b> Deck. Her next foal was Vanetta Dee, who racked up 94 starts with 31 wins, 20 seconds and 16 thirds in six years of racing. Her total earnings were $83,325 (approximately $ in current dollars). Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing Gelding in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first gelding named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, who was never raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, who was never raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the gelding was never raced.|$|E
25|$|Like Butt-Head, Beavis shares scorn for Stewart and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Van</b> Driessen. Though {{he shares}} Butt-Head's mutual hatred for Coach Buzzcut {{for the way}} he {{exploited}} their lack of intelligence, manliness and strength, Beavis has a little respect for him. He has shown some level of respect for Daria, as she is the only student who tolerates the duo the most without losing her cool.|$|E

25|$|Slaves of lighter {{complexion}} sometimes bought {{passage on}} the B railroad to reach Pittsburgh. Other slaves crossed the narrow panhandle of Maryland by foot to reach Pennsylvania. A {{large number of}} free blacks worked with Quakers in this area to facilitate escape.

25|$|As {{far back}} as <b>Mr.</b> <b>van</b> Heerwarden's account of Orang Pendek, people have speculated that the animal {{may in fact be}} a hominin. In October 2004, {{scientists}} published claims of the discovery of skeletal remains of a new species of human (Homo floresiensis) in caves on Flores (another island in the Indonesian archipelago) dating from perhaps as recently as 12,000 years ago (later revised to 50,000 years ago). The species was described as being roughly one meter tall. The recency of Homo floresiensis continued existence and the similarities between its physical description and the accounts of Orang Pendek have led to renewed speculation in this respect.|$|E
500|$|In April, the Whigs {{used the}} House of Representatives {{for an attack}} on President Van Buren. Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania, a law student and {{political}} disciple of Thaddeus Stevens, utilized a debate on White House renovations to spend three days accusing Van Buren of living in luxury at considerable public expense, asking, [...] "If he is vain enough to spend his money in the purchase of rubies for his neck, diamond rings for his fingers, Brussels lace for his breast, filet gloves for his hands, and fabrique de broderies de bougram à Nancy handkerchiefs for his pocket—if he chooses to lay out hundreds of dollars in supplying his toilet with 'Double Extract of Queen Victoria', Eau de Cologne, Corinthian Oil of Cream ... if, I say, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Van</b> Buren sees fit to spend his cash in buying these and other perfumes and cosmetics for his toilet, it can constitute no valid reason for charging the farmers, laborers and mechanics of this country with bills for HEMMING HIS DISH RAGS, FOR HIS LARDING NEEDLES, LIQUOR STANDS, AND FOREIGN CUT WINE COOLERS". Democrats called Ogle's address the [...] "Omnibus of Lies"; Whigs called it the [...] "Gold Spoons speech" [...] and reprinted it in large numbers, attempting to paint Van Buren, who was in fact of far more humble birth than Harrison, as an aristocratic dandy being challenged by {{a man of the}} people.|$|E

[...] Mulholland stated that it appeared that there had been major movement in the hills forming the western buttress of the dam, adding that three eminent geologists, Robert T. Hill, C. F. Tolman and D. W. Murphy, had been hired by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners to determine if this was the cause. It was noted that no tremors had been reported at seismograph stations, ruling out an earthquake as the cause of the break.|$|E

2500|$|Cornholio is an {{alter ego}} of Beavis. Though the Cornholio {{character}} {{was developed in}} the episode [...] "The Great Cornholio", Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in [...] "Generation in Crisis". Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar and/or caffeine. In [...] "Holy Cornholio", the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises his forearms in a 90-degree angle next to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently the name is derived from the word [...] "cornhole"). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting [...] "I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!" [...] in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet. In [...] "Vaya Con Cornholio" [...] he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt {{to make sense of the}} gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of [...] "bunghole". In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with [...] "Nicaragua". Nicaragua may be one of the few things Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis' teacher <b>Mr.</b> <b>Van</b> Driessen refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in [...] "The Great Cornholio", after which Beavis repeats the word while pacing back and forth in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in Bungholio, Lord of the Harvest, which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. He prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt-Head.|$|E
