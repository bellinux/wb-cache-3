5|$|The Duesenberg <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine valvetrain from horizontal overhead valves to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters and factory from New Jersey to Indiana. The <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> when the Model J was introduced.|$|E
5|$|A {{symbol of}} the Institute's {{academic}} and collegiate tradition, the old <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> is often dispatched to special events on campus. It is always present when new buildings are opened or dedicated. On December 5, 2006, the Wreck became the first car to drive across the new Fifth Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the <b>model,</b> <b>a</b> maximum of 3 {{at any given}} time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E

5|$|After 1994, Reck Club {{restored}} the wheels and brakes to original <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 {{that saw the}} car repainted and the motor rebuilt. Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the electrical generator with a more efficient Nu-Rex alternator.|$|E
5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang {{is the result of a}} collision between branes; and the cyclic <b>model,</b> <b>a</b> variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E

5|$|Holliday's {{original}} model {{assumed that}} heteroduplex DNA would be present on both chromosomes, but experimental data on yeast refuted this. An updated model by Matt Meselson and Charley Radding in 1975 introduced {{the idea of}} branch migration. Further observations in the 1980s led to the proposal of alternate mechanisms for recombination such as the double-strand break model (by Jack Szostak, Frank Stahl, and others) and the single-strand annealing <b>model.</b> <b>A</b> third, the synthesis-dependent strand annealing model, did not involve Holliday junctions.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E

5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 Ford <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> Sport coupe {{that serves}} as the {{official}} mascot of the student body at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions. Its most noticeable role is leading the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin' Reck Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} model {{proposed for}} the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism.

50|$|In economics, <b>a</b> <b>model</b> is <b>a</b> {{theoretical}} construct {{that represents}} economic processes {{by a set}} of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them.

Structural parameters are underlying parameters in <b>a</b> <b>model</b> or class of <b>models.</b> <b>A</b> <b>model</b> may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.|$|R
5|$|The {{first model}} in production, in June 1935, was the <b>Model</b> <b>A.</b> It {{contained}} {{most of the}} features {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of drawbars for each manual, and one for the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} of the fake Wrecks is a 1931 Ford <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> Cabriolet known as the Centennial Wreck. This vehicle was {{refurbished}} along with the real Wreck in 1985. The vehicle followed the Ramblin' Wreck onto the field all of the 1985 football season and was raffled for $250,000 by Pete George and Georgia Tech in 1986.|$|E
5|$|There is a 1930 Ford <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> Sports Coupe shell in the Georgia Tech Hotel. This car has {{not worked}} since it has been on campus.

5|$|To address {{concerns}} that {{the sound of the}} Hammond was not rich enough to accurately mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included a chorus generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this. Production of the old <b>Model</b> <b>A</b> cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E
5|$|Beverly Chappell founded The Dougy Center in 1982 {{in tribute}} to Dougy Turno, who died of a brain tumor at age thirteen. In August 1981, Dougy {{wrote a letter to}} {{psychiatrist}} and author Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies, on the subject of his own death. This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross <b>model</b> (<b>a</b> series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed skepticism about the model.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station <b>model.</b> <b>A</b> station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station.
