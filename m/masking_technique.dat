40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present {{an insight into}} the use of {{spectral}} <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> in time-frequency domain, as a preprocessing step for the speech signal recognition. Speech recognition systems have their performance negatively affected in noisy environments or {{in the presence of}} other speech signals. The limits of these <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> for different levels of the signal-to-noise ratio are discussed. We show the robustness of the spectral <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> against four types of noise: white, pink, brown and human speech noise (bubble noise). The main contribution of this work is to analyze the performance limits of recognition systems using spectral masking. We obtain an increase of 18 % in the speech hit rate, when the speech signals were corrupted by other speech signals or bubble noise, with different signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 1, 10 and 20 dB. On the other hand, applying the ideal binary masks to mixtures corrupted by white, pink and brown noise, results in an average growth of 9 % in the speech hit rate, with the same differents signal-to-noise ratios. The experimental results suggest that the spectral <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> are more appropriate when applied to bubble noise, which is produced by human speech, than to white, pink and brown noise.

We evaluated video blurring, an image masking method long touted to balance privacy and awareness. Results show that video blurring is unable to balance privacy with awareness for risky situations. Reactions by participants suggest that other popular image <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> will be problematic as well. The design implication is that image <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> will not suffice for privacy protection in videobased telecommuting situations. Other context-aware privacy-protecting strategies are required, as illustrated in our prototype context-aware home media space...|$|R

5|$|Ultimate {{released}} Knight Lore {{third in}} the Sabreman series despite having completed it first. The Stamper brothers withheld its release for a year to position the company advantageously {{in anticipation of the}} game's effect on the market. Knight Lore novel image <b>masking</b> <b>technique,</b> Filmation, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without their contents colliding. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not natively support. By delaying Knight Lore release, Ultimate protected sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf and created another Filmation game before other developers could copy the style. Ultimate released the original Sabreman trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. Knight Lore came last, in November. Ports followed for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Famicom Disk System. The game was later included in compilations including Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

30|$|Most of {{the work}} has been done for {{handling}} scalability issue while preserving data privacy for outsourced data i.e. for secure data storage and computation at a third party. But for sanitization techniques like hiding sensitive co-occurring patterns or masking restricted rules, scalability is still an issue. <b>Masking</b> <b>techniques</b> {{play a crucial role in}} privacy preservation as even after anonymization or encryption, mined rules can generate certain patterns which may expose sensitive information. Hence, it is equally important for <b>masking</b> <b>techniques</b> to be scalable and fast enough such that data privacy can be preserved in both ways. Further, we will discuss some primary data hiding techniques and their limitations to understand the background of the problem.|$|R

50|$|In the {{aperture}} <b>masking</b> <b>technique,</b> the bispectral analysis (speckle masking) method is typically applied to image data taken through masked apertures, {{where most of}} {{the aperture}} is blocked off and light can only pass through a series of small holes (subapertures). The aperture mask removes atmospheric noise from these measurements, allowing the bispectrum to be measured more quickly than for an un-masked aperture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently, binary <b>mask</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been}} pro-posed {{as a tool}} for {{retrieving}} a target speech signal from a noisy observation. A binary gain function is applied to time–frequency tiles of the noisy observation in order to suppress noise dominated and retain target dominated time–frequency regions. When im-plemented using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) <b>techniques,</b> the binary <b>mask</b> <b>techniques</b> {{can be seen as a}} special case of the broader class of DFT-based speech enhancement algorithms, for which the applied gain function is not constrained to be binary. In this context, we develop and compare binary <b>mask</b> <b>techniques</b> to state-of-the-art continuous gain techniques. We derive spectral magnitude minimum mean-square error binary gain estimators; the binary gain estimators turn out to be simple functions of the continuous gain estimators. We show that the optimal binary estimators are closely related to a range of existing, heuristi-cally developed, binary gain estimators. The derived binary gain estimators perform better than existing binary gain estimators in simulation experiments with speech signals contaminated by several different noise sources as measured by speech quality and intelligibility measures. However, even the best binary mask method is significantly outperformed by state-of-the-art contin-uous gain estimators. The instrumental intelligibility results are confirmed in an intelligibility listening test...|$|R

40|$|Unsharp masking is a {{well-known}} image sharpening technique. Given an image and its smoothed version, amplifying high frequencies of the image via unsharp masking is achieved by linear extrapolation of the input images. In this paper, we adapt the unsharp <b>masking</b> <b>technique</b> for 3 D shape deblurring purposes. Consider a blurred shape represented by a triangle mesh. Usually such a shape results from a 3 D data corrupted by noise and then oversmoothed. First we apply unsharp masking to the mesh normals. To smooth the filed of mesh normals we use several local averaging iterations applied to the mesh normals (iterative mean filtering). Then we apply linear extrapolation of the original and smoothed fields of normals. Finally we reconstruct the deblurred mesh by integrating the field of extrapolated normals. We also give a quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsharp <b>masking</b> <b>technique.</b> To perform the evaluation, we use $L^ 2 $ error metrics on mesh vertices and normals. Experimental {{results show that the}} unsharp <b>masking</b> <b>technique</b> is effective for shape deblurring...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for scheduling real-time periodic tasks on a multiprocessor system under fault-tolerant requirement. Our approach incorporates both the redundancy and <b>masking</b> <b>technique</b> and the imprecise computation model. Since the tasks in hard real-time systems have stringent timing constraints, the redundancy and <b>masking</b> <b>technique</b> are more appropriate than the rollback techniques which usually require extra time for error recovery. The imprecise computation model provides flexible functionality by trading off {{the quality of}} the result produced by a task with the amount of processing time required to produce it. It therefore permits the performance of a real-time system to degrade gracefully. We evaluate the algorithm by stochastic analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the algorithm is resilient under hardware failures...|$|E
