40|$|Abstract. There {{is little}} {{information}} concerning the physical properties of various commercialized water-based temporary filling materials. In this study, the setting characteristics of 5 water-based temporary filling cements, i. e., Caviton, HY-seal, Lumicon, Cavit-G, and Cavit-W, were examined. Reinforced plastic pipes were filled with the test materials, and the specimens were then immersed in distilled water at 37 ˚C. Setting time of each specimen was determined by a penetration test using a Vicat penetrometer; and setting layer depth was measured with <b>micrometer</b> <b>calipers.</b> Cavit-W exhibited the fastest setting time, whereas Caviton and HY-seal demonstrated the slowest setting time. These {{results indicate that the}} setting properties of these materials used in this study were significantly different for each material, which showed some changes on the surface and the internal part after the start of water absorption...|$|R

5000|$|John Edson Sweet (Pompey, New York, October 21, 1832 - Syracuse, New York, May 8, 1916) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer, inventor, professor, {{business man}} {{and president of}} the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1884-85.

50|$|The first {{documented}} {{development of}} handheld micrometer-screw calipers was by Jean Laurent Palmer of Paris in 1848; {{the device is}} therefore often called palmer in French, tornillo de Palmer ("Palmer screw") in Spanish, and calibro Palmer ("Palmer caliper") in Italian. (Those languages also use the micrometer cognates: micromètre, micrómetro, micrometro.) The <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> {{was introduced to the}} mass market in anglophone countries by Brown & Sharpe in 1867, allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop. Brown & Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer's design. In 1888 Edward W. Morley added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{comparing}} {{the accuracy of}} implant impression techniques with methods such as <b>micrometers,</b> Vernier <b>calipers,</b> strain gauges, or measuring microscopes could merely carry out two-dimensional measurements [5, 34 – 36]. However, when the measurements are two dimensional only, relevant information is lost. Therefore, CMM {{was used as the}} measuring device in this study because it made three-dimensional evaluation of any distortion possible. When points from different implant casts have a common reference within a coordinate system, the 3 D orientation of analogs can be recorded [37].|$|R

5000|$|A {{micrometer}} ( [...] ), sometimes {{known as}} a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for precise measurement of components in mechanical engineering and machining {{as well as most}} mechanical trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame), which is why <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> is another common name. The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.|$|E

40|$|A {{study in}} applied {{psychology}} of various factors affecting torque discrimination {{and accuracy of}} micrometer measurement. The standard one-inch vernier <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> and special apparatus constructed by the author were used. A brief training program is described. ^ The literature on accuracy of micrometer measurement was reviewed, including several unpublished studies. A definite trend was noted toward increased recognition of psychological factors. ^ Difference limens for torque discrimination for 37 college students were established and compared with the torque required for zero micrometer measurements. Accuracy of 28 journeymen and 32 apprentice toolmakers and machinists was determined, and divided into reading accuracy and setting accuracy. The accuracy of use of personal and of unfamiliar micrometers was compared. ^ A brief training program in micrometer measurement was established, using five college students as subjects. Errors {{at the end of}} the program were about one-third the size of those made by journeymen, but a test ten days later indicated regression of accuracy to about the mean of the industrial group. ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} feature of gauge blocks {{is that they can}} be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultra-flat surfaces to cling together. A small number of gauge blocks can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or [...]3000 to [...]3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). Gauge blocks were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson. [...] They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as <b>micrometers,</b> sine bars, <b>calipers,</b> and dial indicators (when used in an inspection role). Gauge blocks are the main means of length standardization used by industry.|$|R
40|$|Background: Increased {{in utero}} {{exposure}} to testosterone (T) has long-lasting consequences on development. A {{large body of}} literature suggests prenatal T exposure to influence psychological and biological parameters. Aging is associated with various changes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Measuring one of the balances of these endocrine axes, the cortisol–testosterone ratio (CTr), {{can be used as}} indicator of endocrine health. An imbalance of these two systems (increased C and lower T), can compromise sexual function. Aim: Besides the assessment of the CTr and sexual function, we investigated the moderating effect of prenatal T exposure (i. e. digit-ratio) on the association of the CTr and sexual function in aging males. Methods: All 236 healthy men were between 40 and 75 years. Participants provided saliva samples under standardized conditions at 08 : 00 AM. Digit-ratios were measured, using a digital <b>caliper</b> <b>Micrometer.</b> Sexual function was assessed using the subscale of the aging-male-symptom-scale. Results: Analyses yielded a moderating effect of the digit ratio on the association between the CTr and sexual function for higher than average CTr. Discussion: The results indicate an effect of prenatal testosterone exposure on the association of CTr and sexual function in middle aged and older men. Lower prenatal T (i. e. higher digit-ratio) and higher CTr (increased C and lower T) seem to be associated with decreased sexual function. Implications: Balanced endocrine systems buffer an age-related deterioration of sexual function in middle aged and older men. Based on these functions, preventive interventions could be developed to keep the endocrine system in balance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{previous}} studies on the genetics of tooth formation and movement timing 1 ' 2 we have encountered evidence suggestive of X-mediated inheritance. 8 -' These findings have {{raised the question of}} whether calcification, movement, and apical closure alone indicated sex-chromosomal involvement or whether tooth size and tooth morphology might also reveal evidence of X-chromosomal mediation. The present report, therefore, is concerned with tooth size in siblings of like-sex and unlike-sex. The mesiodistal tooth measurements were completed before the specific hypothesis was advanced for testing and therefore were free of unconscious bias in this respect. Materials and Methods This study is based upon vernier <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> measurements of the mediodistal crown diameters of the permanent teeth of participants in the Fels Longitudinal Studies, as taken on plaster casts from alginate impressions. All measurements were read to the nearest 0. 1 mm., transferred to pre-coding forms, and then to standard 80 column IBM punch cards, especially coded to include family number, sex, and birth order. After verifying the punched data against the precoding forms, like-sex and cross-sex correlations were calculated for individual left and right and upper and lower teeth, respectively, for 73 subject pairs using the IBM 1620 Electronic computer at th...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: A-mode {{ultrasound}} scanning with coded signals allows bone thickness measurements {{at the site}} of bone-anchored hearing aid surgery as compared to computed tomographic scanning and mechanical measurements. Background: Adequate bone thickness is a prerequisite for successful, long-lasting osseointegration of titanium fixtures for bone-anchored hearing aids. Computed tomography can be used to measure bone thickness but has several drawbacks. Material: Bone thickness was measured {{at the site of}} bone-anchored hearing aids surgery in 28 formaldehyde-preserved human cadaver temporoparietal bones. Four blinded investigators used a hand-held, A-mode ultrasound system with direct coupling at 2. 25 MHz transducer using coded signals (SonoPointer) and repeated the measurements twice. Comparisons were made with high-resolution computed tomographic scanning and mechanical <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> measurements. Results: There was significant anatomical variation in the temporoparietal bones. Computed tomography was in good agreement with the mechanical reference. All specimens could be measured by the SonoPointer. The mean difference between the mechanical control and {{ultrasound scanning}} averaged for all measurements by all investigators was 0. 3 mm (standard deviation, 1. 2 mm). Trained ultrasound experts yielded better results (mean difference, 0. 3 mm; standard deviation, 1. 0 mm). Agreement was best for bone thickness up to 5 mm. Outliers occurred in bones thicker than 7. 5 mm. Conclusion: The SonoPointer is a promising, noninvasive, hand-held tool for real-time measurement of bone thickness in bone-anchored hearing aid surgery, especially for children. Even disregarding the absolute thickness reading, the SonoPointer could be used to searc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stress-strain {{curves of}} {{some kinds of}} {{materials}} at high strain-rate conditions were able {{to be determined by}} a drop weight experiment system which has only to measure the force-time relation using a load-cell but not to measure directly the deformation or deformation-rate of specimen. To evaluate the strain-rate or the strain of the specimen it had been necessary to measure the motion, i. e. the velocity or the displacement of tup and anvil so far. In this new method the velocity and the displacement of the tup and the anvil which contacted the both end surfaces of specimen were calculated using a personal computer {{on the basis of the}} equations of motion for the tup and the anvil, respectively. The differential equations, in which the measured dynamic-force versus time characteristics were contained, were integrated by Runge-Kutta method using the personal computer. In the differential equation of motion of the anvil, a spring coefficient K for the rubber cushion beneath the anvil is used. For the first approximation of the coefficient K is assumed to be the value determined by the oscillation method of cantilever beam. The spring coefficient K with high accuracy is determined when the computed strain of the specimen on the basis of the method described above is almost equal to the measured strain of it by using a <b>micrometer</b> <b>caliper</b> after the dynamic compression. The coefficient K with the higher accuracy can be obtained the incremental compression experiment using some kinds of hard stop ring in the prescribed height...|$|E
