25|$|Many {{rock bands}} claim folk influences. Žalvarinis is a folk metal band from Vilnius. Their music is {{typically}} very slow-paced with exclusively Lithuanian lyrics. Another folk-rock band Atalyja is worth <b>mentioning</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> context.|$|R
25|$|Convergence in {{distribution}} is the weakest form of convergence, {{since it is}} implied by all other types of convergence <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article.

25|$|Thus, {{according}} to Meyer, {{it is clear}} that without Jesus, the rituals and mysteries <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> gospel would have no context.

25|$|Yellow {{and pink}} are {{a mix of}} red and green or blue. Other shades of red as well as orange may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is {{moderately}} common.

40|$|Some years ago, Lokhorst {{proposed}} an intuitionistic reformulation of Mally's deontic logic (1926).

25|$|The 8th century BL Add. 14,643 was {{published}} by Wright who first brought to attention the mention of an early date of 947 AG (635-6 CE).

25|$|However, the Faroese ting <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> saga {{must have}} been a well {{introduced}} institution in the 10th century, for it was held each year and is not described as something new or unusual.

It is possible that the Faroese ting is older than that of Iceland, which was founded in 930.|$|E
