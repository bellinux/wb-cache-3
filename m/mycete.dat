40|$|In {{the period}} 1980 - 1998, 181 cases of tinea capitis {{out of a}} total of 1480 cases of {{dermatophytosis}} were observed in Siena, Italy; 176 cases were children (mean age 6 years, range 45 days to 14 years; 91 boys, 85 girls) and the other five cases were postmenopausal women. Diagnosis was made on the basis of culture which was positive in 179 cases, and direct microscopic observation which was positive in 155 of 179 cases. In two cases, positive direct microscopic results were not confirmed by the culture. The most frequently isolated <b>mycete</b> was Microsporum canis (162 cases, 90. 5 %) and the main source of infection was the cat, which was often a healthy carrier. The second most frequent <b>mycete</b> was Trychophyton mentagrophytes. Trichophyton violaceum, a dermatophyte practically absent from our province since the 1960 s, was isolated in five patients. All patients were successfully treated. One adult was treated with oral ketoconazole and the other four with oral itraconazole.

During spring 2013, distinct dark brown spots were observed on pomegranate fruits, from which a fungus was isolated on standard potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin (0. 05 % w/v). The mycelium was white- grey turning olive green over time, and produced oval to cylindrical, hyaline, unicellular, aseptate conidia measuring 5 - 13 × 1. 5 - 4 μm. Based on these morphological characters the <b>mycete</b> was tentatively identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of r-DNA was then amplified using the primers ITS 5 /ITS 4 sequenced locally and deposited under GeneBank accession No. KJ 769129. A sequence similarity search performed using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) algorithm available via GenBank confirmed the identification as C. gloeosporioides. Pathogenicity tests were carried out by placing agar-discs from a six-day-old culture of the fungus onto five artificially injured pomegranate fruits, which were placed inside sterile plastic bags.

In all the three streams the kill crayfish were in different state of preservation and only just died or moribund crayfish with or without apparent lesions were collected and submitted to mycological, parasitological, bacteriological, virological, and hystopatological analyses. In the rivers examined Extended Biotic Index (EBI) and chemical-physical and bacteriological water analyses were carried out. During the surveys, saprophytes, ectosymbionts and ectocommensal organisms were frequently observed in crayfish. No virus was found. Fusarium sp. was the most frequently isolated <b>mycete</b> and it occurred in pure culture from the specimens coming from Rio Selve creek. Furthermore Mucor sp. and Penicillium sp were detected on the crayfish from the Rossenna river, while Trichoderma sp., Alternaria sp., Gliocladium sp. and Mucor sp. from Lerna specimens. At Bacteriological investigation Hafnia alvei was isolated both from Lerna and Rio Selve samples, while Aeromonas hydrophila from Lerna. At the histology, all the crayfish showed severe fungal hyphae infiltrations of exoskeleton and superficial skeletal muscle through the hypodermis with inflammation and melanization.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of candidiasis and cryptococcosis {{is based on}} the use of antimycotic drugs such as amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, miconazole and fluconazole. Isoliquiritigenin {{is a member of the}} flavonoids and data in scientific literature assert that these compounds can modulate the biosynthesis of endogenous sterols, which are known to be very important for the survival of <b>mycete.</b> In this study we investigated the antifungal effect of isoliquiritigenin on strains of Candidae spp and C. neoformans cultured on Sabouraud medium. Amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, miconazole and fluconazole were chosen as reference drugs. Sensitivity tests were performed in according with the NCCLS method for agar dilution and MIC values were calculated for all the substances. No antifungal activity was evident in cultures treated with isoliquiritigenin (MIC values > 100 mg/L) while, very interesting results came from the combination: isoliquiritigenin/ antifungal drugs used at inhibitory and sub-inhibitory concentrations on yeast cultures (isoliquiritigenin 50 - 10 mg/L, amphotericin B 10 - 0. 1 mg/L, 5 -fluorocytosine 2. 5 - 0. 5 mg/L, miconazole 0. 25 - 0. 05, fluconazole 10 - 0. 1 mg/L). The FIC index used to estimate the interactions outcomes was also calculated. The association of isoliquiritigenin with the antimycotic often resulted in a synergic effect with addition (0. 55 <FIC index< 1). In few cases we observed indifference (1 <FIC index< 2). Antagonism never appeared. Finally, we performed the MTT test on Vero cells to evaluate the toxic effect of the dosages used in the combinations. The results from the MTT test performed on Vero coltures added with the drugs used alone or in association showed the low toxicity of the combinations...|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane {{not only}} has {{applications}} including tires and in-sulation, but also is {{an essential element of}} our lives. Based on previous reports, some strains of fungus including Pestalo-tiopsis microspora have been reported to degrade this plastic. The ultimate objective is to create a genetically engineered variant of Pichia pastoris which will digest polyester polyure-thane (PUR) using the enzyme responsible for PUR degrada-tion from Aspergillus flavus; this year we aim to identify the esterase, believed to be responsible for the biodegradation. The degradation of TPU (a granular form of thermoplastic PUR) and water-based PUR by A. flavus, was tested using incubation with shaking for one month. Although no significant weight loss was observed, the fungus was capable of grow-ing on the water-based PUR as a food source. Esterase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the water-based PUR, was observed in the water-based PUR lane of the Na-tive PAGE gel and has a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa. Since the only difference between the experimental wa-ter-based lane and experimental TPU lane, was the esterase band, it can be confirmed that the degradation of the plastic and growth of fungus {{can be attributed to the}} esterase. Le polyuréthane a non seulement des applications dans la fabrication des pneus et pour l’isolation, mais est aussi un élément essentiel à notre vie.

With Pithecia leucocephala the young likewise resemble the females, which are brownish-black above and light rusty-red beneath, the adult males being black. The ruff of hair round the face of Ateles marginatus is tinted yellow in the male and white in the female. Turning to the Old World, the males of Hylobates hoolock are always black, {{with the exception of a}} white band over the brows; the females vary from whity-brown to a dark tint mixed with black, but are never wholly black.[361] In the beautiful Cercopithecus diana the head of the adult male is of an intense black, whilst that of the female is dark grey; in the former the fur between the thighs is of an elegant fawn-colour, in the latter it is paler. In the equally beautiful and curious moustache monkey (Cercopithecus cephus) the only difference between the sexes is that the tail of the male is chesnut and that of the female grey; but Mr. Bartlett informs me that all the hues become more strongly pronounced in the male when adult, whilst in the female they remain as they were during youth. According to the coloured figures given by Solomon Müller, the male of Semnopithecus chrysomelas is nearly black, the female being pale brown. In the Cercopithecus cynosurus and griseo-viridis one part of the body which is confined to the male sex is of the most brilliant blue or green, and contrasts strikingly with the naked skin on the hinder part of the body, which is vivid red.|$|R
