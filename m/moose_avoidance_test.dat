40|$|Goal, Scope and Background: The {{earthworm}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> is {{a sensitive}} screening test. Currently, two test designs, a two-chamber {{system and a}} six-chamber system, are under standardization. In {{the scope of the}} present study, the two test systems are compared. To assess the results, two procedures are applied, which are based on a threshold value and a statistical method. Moreover, the sensitivity of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> is compared with the sensitivity of the reproduction <b>test.</b> Methods: The <b>avoidance</b> behaviour of E. fetida towards five chemicals (Cd, Cu, PCP, TBT, TNT) was tested in a sandy and a loamy soil. The ecotoxicological test was performed according to the draft guideline ISO/DIS 17512 - 1. The results were compared with the number of offspring determined in the reproduction test carried out according to ISO 11268 - 2. Results and Discussion: The results demonstrate that the avoidance behaviour towards organic chemicals and heavy metals is a suitable screening method showing first tendencies of a chemical’s effects on the habitat function of soils. Effects caused by chemical substances become visible at low concentrations and within short test periods. The sensitivity of the reproduction <b>test</b> and the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> is principally comparable; in some cases, the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> showed more sensitive reactions. The dose-response-relationships were more pronounced in the two-chamber test than in the six-chamber-system. Recommendation and Outlook: The two-chamber-system proved to be more feasible than the six-chamber-system. As the sensitivity of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> and the reproduction test is comparable, the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> can be considered as a suitable screening test as well. A possible field of application may be the selection of soil samples for which the reproduction assay seems necessary. To assess contaminated or remediated soils, the earthworm reproduction test is recommended as an indicator for the habitat function of the soils. To reduce costs, the labour intensive reproduction test could be largely replaced by the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> in performing the earth-worm reproduction test only for relevant samples. Before the Draft International Standard of the guideline will be adopted as an ISO Guideline, there will be sufficient time left to gain further international experience required to finalize the method...|$|R

In this study, effects of lithium on sumatriptan-induced memory impairment have been determined in a two-trial recognition Y-maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests.</b> Male mice weighing 25 - 30 g were divided into several groups randomly. In Y-maze test, effects of lithium (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 mg/kg) and sumatriptan (1, 5, 10 mg/kg) were assessed on memory acquisition, then lithium (0. 1, 1, 10 mg/kg) and sumatriptan (1, 10 mg/kg) were studied in passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test.</b> Effects of lithium (1 mg/kg) on sumatriptan (10 mg/kg) -induced memory impairment were studied in both of tests.

Such an evaluation therefore is essential to complement the chemical analysis that, although required by law, is clearly insufficient. Using a tiered approach in the toxic evaluation {{of sewage sludge}} allows for characterization of toxicity in a timely manner. According to the literature, reproduction tests with Folsomia candida are suitable tools for the toxic assessment of organic sludges. Therefore, the inclusion of Collembola <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests</b> at a screening level (low tier), and acting as a trigger for longer-period tests (high tier; e. g. reproduction test), may provide a successful strategy, and may complement the currently proposed test battery. To evaluate the use of both <b>avoidance</b> and reproduction <b>tests</b> with collembolans in such a tiered approach, three sewage sludges (urban, olive and electroplating industries) were mixed in with a field-collected soil at different concentrations. <b>Avoidance</b> and reproduction <b>tests</b> were performed with the soil-sludge mixtures after 0, 4 and 12 weeks of incubation. The tests detected no toxicity in soil-sludge mixtures of urban and olive sludges at any incubation period. Mixtures with sludge from the electroplating industry induced toxicity only in the <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests</b> with freshly prepared and 4 -week incubated samples.

40|$|Intention, Goal, Scope, Background. The habitat {{function}} of soils is often assessed using the reproduction test with Eisenia fetida. As {{this test is}} rather labour-intensive, an alternative is needed which is less cost-intensive in terms of duration and workload, but gives reasonable results. The <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> with E. fetida is a suitable screening test meeting these criteria. However, before a novel test system can be generally recommended {{it has to be}} ensured that comparable results are acquired from different laboratories {{on the basis of the}} respective test guideline. Objective. The <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> with E. fetida was performed as laboratory comparison test. The results were compared with those of the earthworm acute and reproduction test carried out with the same soils. Methods. The three tests were performed by three laboratories using eight contaminated soils and three control soils. The contaminated soils were mixed with the control soils to obtain different concentrations of the contamination. Results and Discussion. The results of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> show that despite the partially considerable standard deviations a 72 % agreement in the assessment of soils was reached with a toxicity criterion of > 80 % avoidance response.

Thirty-two male mice were fed either a control (palm oil, control group) diet or a diet of 20 % dried mackerel (mackerel group) for three months. Learning behav-ior was assessed using a passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test,</b> and the tissue fatty acid composition was measured after the behavioral test. The lack of experience with electronic foot shocks resulted in both the control and mackerel groups showing shorter latency during the acquisition trial (Day 1). The avoidance latencies of each group subsequently increased after multiple acquisition trials. The mackerel group showed a significantly longer avoidance latency on day 2 than {{was the case with the}} control group (p < 0. 05). In terms of the fatty acid composition of the serum and nervous tissues such as the brain and retina, the mackerel group showed increased percentages of total n- 3 fatty acids, and especially docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids. Meanwhile, the control group showed decreased DHA levels, but increased docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn- 6) levels.

One option for assessing earthworm avoidance behavior is a two-section test, which consists of earthworms being given the choice to move between a test soil and a control substrate. For ecological relevance, tested soils should be field contaminated soils. For practical reasons, artificial soils are commonly used as the control substrate. Interpretation of the test results compromised when the test soil and the artificial substrate differ in their physico-chemical properties other than just contaminants. In this study we identified the physico-chemical properties that influence avoidance response and evaluated the usefulness of adjusting these in the control substrate in order to isolate metal-driven avoidance of field soils by earthworms. A standardized two-section <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> with Eisenia fetida was performed on 52 uncontaminated and contaminated (Cu> 155 mg kg− 1, As> 19 mg kg− 1) agricultural soils from the Aconcagua River basin and the Puchuncaví Valley in Chile.

Interestingly, the level of CREB phosphorylation and BDNF expression in hippocampal tissue of scopolamine-treated mice was significantly increased by the administration of fermented C. lanceolata. These results indicate that fermented C. lanceolata can ameliorate scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mouse and may be an alternative agent {{for the treatment of}} AD...|$|R

Codonopsis lanceolata (Campanulaceae) have been traditionally used to treat lung inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. The present study was performed to evaluate the cognitive-enhancing effects of steamed and fermented C. lanceolata in scopolamine-induced memory impairments in mice. Cognitive abilities were determined by the Morris water maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests.</b> Mice orally received fermented C. lanceolata extract at doses of 100, 300, or 500 mg/kg body weight. Fermented C. lanceolata extract (500 mg/kg body weight, p. o.) significantly shortened the escape latency times that were increased by scopolamine on the 4 th day of trial sessions in the Morris water maze task. In addition, it exerted longer step-through latency times {{than those of the}} scopolamine-treated group in the passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of fermented C. lanceolata extract on glutamate-induced neurocytotoxicity were investigated in HT 22 cells. Fermented C. lanceolat...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the neuropharmacological effects of Gongjin-Dan (GJD) on the memory impairment caused by scopolamine injection. BALB/c mice were orally treated with GJD (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg, daily) or tacrine (THA, 10 mg/kg) for 10 days, and scopolamine (2 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally. The radial arm maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests</b> {{were performed to}} evaluate the animal's learning and memory. Scopolamine increased the task completing time, the number of total errors (reference and working memory error) in the radial arm maze task, and the latency time in the passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test,</b> which were significantly ameliorated by treatment with GJD. The GJD treatment also attenuated the scopolamine-induced hyperactivation of acetylcholinesterase activity, and suppression of the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and their receptors in the hippocampus. These effects of GJD were supported by both the doublecortin (DCX) -positive staining and Nissl staining, which were used to measure hippocampal neurogenesis and atrophy, respectively. These findings strongly suggest that GJD exerts a potent anti-amnesic effect, and its underlying mechanism might involve the modulation of cholinergic activity...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Epilepsy is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder in which patients experience spontaneous recurrent seizures and deficiency in learning and memory. Although {{the most commonly}} recommended therapy is drug treatment, some patients do not achieve adequate control of their seizures on existing drugs. New medications with novel mechanisms of action are needed to help those patients whose seizures are resistant to currently-available drugs. While alpha-lipoic acid as a antioxidant has some neuroprotective properties, but this action has not been investigated in models of epilepsy. Therefore, the protective effect of pretreatment with alpha-lipoic acid was evaluated in experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy in male rats. Methods: In the present study, Wistar male rats were injected intrahippocampally with 0. 9 % saline(Sham-operated group), kainic acid(4 μg) alone, or α-lipoic acid (25 mg and 50 mg/kg) in association with kainic acid(4 μg). We performed behavior monitoring(spontaneous seizure, learning and memory by Y-maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test),</b> intracranial electroencepholography (iEEG) recording, histological analysis, to evaluate the anti- epilepsy effect of α-lipoic acid in kainate-induced epileptic rats.   Results: Behavior data showed that the kainate rats exhibit spontaneous seizures, lower spontaneous alternation score inY-maze tasks (p< 0. 01), impaired retention and recall capability in the passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> (p< 0. 05). Administration of alpha-lipoic acid, in both doses, significantly decrease the number of spontaneous seizures, improved alternation score in Y-maze task (p< 0. 005) and impaired retention and recall capability in the passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>test</b> (p< 0. 01) in kainite rats. Moreover, lipoic acid could improve the lipid peroxidation and nitrite level and superoxid dismutase activity. Conclusion: This study indicates that lipoic acid pretreatment attenuates kainic acid-induced impairment of short-term spatial memory in rats probably due to its antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|Backround : Oxidative {{stress can}} cause death of hippocampal cells {{associated}} {{to the deficit}} of learning and memory function. Turmeric rhizome contains curcuminoid which has antioxidant activity that can prevent oxidative stress, thus it was expected to prevent the deficit of learning and memory function on trimethyltin (TMT) -induced rat models. Objectve : This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of turmeric rhizome extract on cognitive learning and memory fuction which was tested using radial arm maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests</b> on Wistar rats injected with TMT. Methods : A total of 30 Wistar rats, male, 8 - 12 weeks of age were divided into 6 groups. The first (normal) group was given CMC-Na, the second (TMT) group was given CMC-Na, the third-the fifth groups were given turmeric rhizome extract (TRE) orally in the dosage of 120 mg/kgBW (TRE 120), 240 mg/kgBW (TRE 240) and 480 mg/kgBW (TRE 480), respectivelly. The sixth (P 500) group was given piracetam in the dosage of 500 mg/kgBW. Treatments were given for 8 days orally. At day- 9 th, excluding the first group, all rats were injected with 12 mg/kgBW TMT solution intraperitoneally. One day after TMT injection, the cognitive learning and memory function was measured using radial maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests.</b> The datas of cognitve function tests were analyzed statistically by ANOVA test followed by LSD test at significance level 0. 05. Results : The results of radial maze and passive <b>avoidance</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the TRE 240 group was not statistically significant different with TMT group(p> 0. 05). However there were significant difference between TRE 120 and TMT groups, as well as between TRE 480 and TMT groups (p 0. 05). Conclusion : It can be concluded that the administration of 480 mg/kgBW of TRE can improve cognitive learning and memory function of Wistar rats injected by TMT...|$|R
