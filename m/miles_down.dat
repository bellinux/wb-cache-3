5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the road.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E

25|$|As {{the highway}} {{approaches}} Bridgeport {{from the south}} it joins up with US26 to cross the North Platte River. On {{the south side of}} town, US26 continues to the west where it passes Chimney Rock National Historic Site just twelve <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the road. Continuing north across the river the two highways diverge, with US26 heading east towards Broadwater and Ogallala while US385 resumes its northward heading. For a brief few miles the roadway is, again, surrounded by agricultural fields, brought to life with center pivot irrigation north of Bridgeport. The highway transitions into slightly rugged terrain as it climbs back up, 400 feet, out of the valley.|$|E

He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding, two <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the road from Leighton Bromswold, to found the remarkable community with which his name has ever since been associated. Herbert raised money (including the use of his own) to restore the neglected church building at Leighton.|$|E

25|$|The {{most intense}} action amongst these six captures {{occurred}} off Santiago de Cuba on 14 March when Loring saw a privateer schooner in a bay. He sent boats {{to bring her}} out but the enemy had established fortifications on the two heights that guarded the bay. From there, the enemy was able to repulse the attack, killing the lieutenant {{in command of the}} boats. Lark then put ashore a landing party some ten <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the coast. This landing party marched up the coast and attacked the privateer from the rear with the result that when Loring led boats back into the bay he found the landing party had already captured the quarry. The privateer had two carriage guns and Loring destroyed her rather than bring her out.|$|E
25|$|After {{reaching}} the Great Slave Lake using the standard HBC route, Franklin took a reconnaissance trip 1,000 <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the Mackenzie and on 16 August 1825, became the second European {{to reach its}} mouth. He erected a flagpole with buried letters for Parry. He returned to winter at Fort Franklin on the Great Bear Lake. The following summer he went downriver and found the ocean frozen. He worked his way west for several hundred miles and gave up on 16 August 1826 at Return Reef {{when he was about}} 150 miles east of Beechey's Point Barrow. Reaching safety at Fort Franklin on 21 September, he left Fort Franklin on 20 February 1827 and {{spent the rest of the}} winter and spring at Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. He reached Liverpool on the first of September 1827. Richardson's eastward journey was more successful.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, President Madison and Secretary Jones {{returned}} to Washington, but by August 27 British naval forces {{under the command}} of Captain James Gordon advanced on the capital a second time, making their approach by way of the Potomac River with two frigates and a number of smaller vessels reaching Fort Washington, twelve <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> river from the capital. The fort was abandoned when fired upon; the American forces retreated to Alexandria, five miles up river, just seven miles outside of Washington. On August 29, Gordon advanced on and captured this town and port, seizing supplies which were then loaded aboard the invading vessels. Upon receiving orders to join Admiral Cockburn's squadron to the south, Gordon's flotilla sailed down river but was delayed due to adverse winds near Fort Washington. Fearing the British had further designs on the capital, Secretary Jones again began preparing defensive forces. On August 29, he sent Rodgers orders to proceed to Bladensburg from Baltimore with 650 seamen and marines. The day before, Rodgers had ordered Porter to Washington; Porter's 100 sailors and a handful of officers arrived on August 30 with the purpose of guarding the capital. The next day Rodgers and Porter together arrived at Bladensburg where Rodgers met with Secretary Jones. As the American forces were regrouped and in strong defensive positions, the British decided to withdraw. The American forces commanded by Porter and Perry began harassing the retreating British while Rodgers was attacking the British fleet with fireships. Rodgers had previously improvised his fireships at the Washington Navy Yard. On September 3, he proceeded down the Potomac in a Gig closely followed by his fireships and barges, the latter being manned with 60 marines armed with muskets and swords. When they reached Alexandria, Rodgers entered the abandoned town and ordered the American flag hoisted.|$|E

500|$|The Ambrose {{leader cable}} was an armored cable {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E

During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.|$|E
