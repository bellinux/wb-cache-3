5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium <b>mineral</b> <b>salts.</b> Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

25|$|If the {{cladogram}} {{above is}} correct it {{has implications for}} the evolution of land plants. The earliest diverging polysporangiophytes in the cladogram are the Horneophytopsida, a clade at the 'protracheophyte' grade that is sister to all other polysporangiophytes. They had essentially an isomorphic alternation of generations (meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes were equally free living), which might suggest that both the gametophyte-dominant life style of bryophytes and the sporophyte-dominant life style of vascular plants evolved from this isomorphic condition. They were leafless and did not have true vascular tissues. In particular, they did not have tracheids: elongated cells that help transport water and <b>mineral</b> <b>salts,</b> and that develop a thick lignified wall at maturity that provides mechanical strength. Unlike plants at the bryophyte grade, their sporophytes were branched.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are {{comparatively}} short streams {{fed by the}} snows of {{the several}} ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the Tarim Basin, the Tarim, which has been dammed {{at a number of}} locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the Lop Lake. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into Lake Manas. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of <b>mineral</b> <b>salts</b> (used e.g., in the manufacturing of potassium fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of supplementation with protein enriched <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> in behavior and productive performance of heifers of native breeds during the Spring and Summer in a Mediterranean climate. The study was conducted between April and August, during 150 days. Two homogeneous groups of heifers (± 8 months of age) were formed and assigned in two treatments: without <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> (NS) and with <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> (WS). The animals were placed in two adjacent fences with approximately 4 ha each. The test was divided into two periods: P 1 (from April to 15 th June) and P 2 (from 16 th June to late August). In P 1 animals ate only natural grassland, while in P 2 animals were supplemented with hay of poor quality. Behavior observations were made using focal methodology every 5 minutes, from 7 a. m. to 8 p. m. Observed activities were: grazing, ruminating and leisure; and events: water intake and <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> intake (this last only in treatment WS). Grazing is the activity that takes longer throughout the day, followed by leisure and rumination. Supplementation with the <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> resulted in no change in the duration of activities. Environmental variables, i. e. the high summer temperatures were most responsible for changing behavior patterns, determining that food intake occurred preferentially during the cooler periods.

Thirty male sheep fed tifton grass hay, water, and faveleira fodder salt were randomly allocated into five treatments with six replicates each. The treatments consisted of diets with different inclusion levels of faveleira hay in the fodder salt composition: Treatment 1 (1 % <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> + 99 % faveleira hay), Treatment 2 (3 % <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> + 97 % faveleira hay), Treatment 3 (5 % <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> + 95 % faveleira hay), Treatment 4 (7 % <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> + 93 % faveleira hay), and Treatment 5 (Control - 100 % <b>mineral</b> <b>salt).</b> Intake of dry matter, tifton hay and water, average daily gain, feed conversion, and feed efficiency were not affected by fodder salt supplementation (P > 0. 05). There {{was a significant difference}} (P < 0. 05) in fodder salt intake between Treatments 4 and 5, and daily intake was higher in animals submitted to Treatment 4 (61. 0 g day- 1). <b>Mineral</b> <b>salt</b> intake increased significantly with increasing <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> levels in the diet. However, no significant difference was observed in average daily gain across treatments, indicating that faveleira hay, even in small quantities, and tifton hay were able to meet the nutritional requirements of animals to support a good average daily gain. The inclusion of up to 99 % faveleira hay in fodder salt formulations did not affect voluntary intake of forage, water and dry matter, average daily gain, feed conversion, and feed efficiency. Lambs supplemented with faveleira fodder salt had average daily gains within the optimal range for slaughter and high feed conversion and feed efficiency values.

25|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{nature of the}} arthropod exoskeleton limits its ability to stretch or change shape as the animal grows. In some special cases, such as the abdomens of termite queens and honeypot ants means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into {{a period of time}} when the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or ecdysis, which is under the control of a hormone called ecdysone. Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and <b>mineral</b> <b>salts</b> are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. A newly molted arthropod typically is pale in colour; in that state it is said to be teneral or a callow. It generally darkens or otherwise gains colour as its exoskeleton hardens.|$|E

500|$|Deserts contain {{substantial}} mineral resources, sometimes {{over their}} entire surface, giving them their characteristic colors.

Similarly, evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes, creating dry lake beds or playas rich in minerals.
