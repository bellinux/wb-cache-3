5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Justice,</b> which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
