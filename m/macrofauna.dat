25|$|Cold seeps and {{hydrothermal}} vents of deep oceans are {{communities that}} do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production. These systems are largely driven by chemosynthetic derived energy. Both systems share common characteristics such {{as the presence of}} reduced chemical compounds (H2S and hydrocarbonates), local hypoxia or even anoxia, a high abundance and metabolic activity of bacterial populations, and the production of autochthonous, organic material by chemoautotrophic bacteria. Both hydrothermal vents and cold seeps show regularly, highly increased levels of metazoan biomass in association with a low local diversity. This is explained through the presence of dense aggregations of foundation species and epizooic animals, living within these aggregations. Community-level comparisons reveal that vent, seep and organic-fall <b>macrofauna</b> are very distinct in terms of composition at the family level, although they share many dominant taxa among highly sulphidic habitats.|$|E

Although the faunas here listed comprise the largest macrofossil collections yet made from Cenozoic deposits of the Dry Valley region of Antarctica, they are sparse with the pectinid Adamussium colbecki (SMITH, 1902) being the predominant taxon. Six molluscan species are recorded for the first time from the New Harbor deposits.

40|$|The first Carboniferous and ?Permian marine <b>macrofaunas</b> {{from the}} Antarctic {{continent}} are described from three sites near Mount King, Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula. They include bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, gastropods, a possible monoplacophoran, nautiloids {{and a possible}} serpulid or microconchid. Overall the faunas of two localities are Carboniferous in age and compare well with the Levipustula levis Zone of Argentina and eastern Australia, and are of Namurian (Serpukhovian–Bashkirian) age, based mainly on the brachiopod and bryozoan faunas. Less positive brachiopod evidence from a third locality indicates {{the presence of a}} linoproductid fauna of possible Carboniferous or Permian (Gzhelian–Artinskian) age, having affinities with the Argentinian Cancrinella fauna. The lithological and structural characteristics of the Mount King beds are comparable to the accretionary complex of the LeMay Group (hitherto of only proven Jurassic–Cretaceous age) of Alexander Island, in which they are provisionally placed. However, the beds may also correlate with the Trinity Peninsula Group (Carboniferous–Triassic) of the northern Antarctic Peninsula.

40|$|The Cretaceous {{period is}} often {{regarded}} as one of "greenhouse" warmth, with perhaps its acme occurring in the late Albian stage (100 Ma ago). However, it is now apparent that, even at this time, there were significant meridional temperature gradients and distinct temperate biotas in the highest latitude regions. This is particularly so in the Southern Hemisphere, where an extensive Albian fossil record from Antarctica, Australia and New Zealand has revealed the presence of austral floras and faunas. With the recent improvements in stratigraphical correlations, it has become possible to trace the later Cretaceous palaeoenvironmental record in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Unfortunately, resolution of the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian–Coniacian stages) is still imprecise; there are some indications of strongly differentiated palynological assemblages, but studies of both <b>macrofaunas</b> and palaeotemperature estimates are incomplete. By the Santonian–Campanian, high-latitude biotas are well developed in the James Ross Island region and their enhancement through the final stages of the Cretaceous can be linked to a phase of global cooling. The persistence of low diversity temperate communities in high latitude regions may be of considerable ecological and evolutionary significance. For example, there is evidence to suggest that these communities may have been more resistant to mass extinction events; they may also have been important source regions for replacement taxa that arose after such events...|$|R

40|$|A strange {{paradox is}} {{presented}} by the great abundance of body fossils of spatangoid echinoids in Cretaceous to Recent rocks and the extreme rarity of burrows attributable to them. The <b>macrofaunas</b> of the Miocene sediments of Malta are dominated by spatangoid body fossils, but a search for corresponding trace fossils proved fruitless. Similarly, species of Micraster occur commonly at some horizons in the Upper Cretaceous chalk of NW Europe, but burrows attributable to these spatangoids have not been detected. In contrast, the Pleistocene Rhodos Formation of Rhodes, Greece, has been bioturbated almost exclu-sively by the spatangoid Echinocardium cordatum, five specimens {{of which have been}} retrieved {{at the end of their}} burrows in life position. The burrows are well preserved owing to selective calcite cementation, which has emphasized their meniscate backfill structure. The single drain and uncommon vertical funnels have also been cemented. Distribution of the cement corresponds to that of mucus as observed in burrows of E. cordatum today. Survival of the burrows of E. cordatum in the Rhodos Formation is considered to be due to the fact that this spatangoid burrowed to a depth of some 15 cm below the seafloor. In contrast, most spatangoids burrow relatively shallowly, and the general failure of pre-servation of their traces is probably due to their subsequent destruction by the activity of more deeply burrowing organisms.

It also provides quantitative evidence that the ages of the paleontologically defined boundaries, based on conodont unitary association zones in Meishan and on <b>macrofaunas</b> in Dongpan, are identical and coincide with the age of the formational boundaries. The age model also confirms the extreme condensation around the PTB in Meishan, which distorts the projection of any stratigraphic points or intervals onto other more expanded sections by means of Bayesian age–depth models. Dongpan and Penglaitan possess significantly higher sediment accumulation rates and thus offer a greater potential for high-resolution studies of environmental proxies and correlations around the PTB than Meishan.

40|$|The Capertee High in the Mudgee-Capertee {{region was}} a Late Silurian to {{earliest}} Middle Devonian shallow marine to subaerial palaeogeographic unit {{to the east}} of the Hill End Trough, north-east Lachlan Fold Belt, southeastern Australia. Rocks of the Capertee High occur in structurally-complex sequences along with Ordovician basement, thick Late Devonian siliciclastic sequences, and Middle Carboniferous granitic intrusions. Flat-lying Permian-Mesozoic sequences overlap the High in the east and north. Early Devonian sequences associated with the Capertee High can be broadly subdivided into two categories: (a) Platform sequences, which were deposited on the shallow marine to subaerial platform areas of the Capertee High and have been collectively defined as the approximately 4000 m thick Kandos Group; and (b) Western Platform Margin Sequences, which were deposited in slope and base-of-slope settings along the western margin of the Capertee High platform and have been subdivided into the Queens Pinch and Limekilns Groups. The latter sequences are transitional westwards with strata of the eastern Hill End Trough. This thesis focuses on: (a) elucidating the stratigraphy, depositional processes and environments, and palaeogeography of the Kandos Group (particularly in the Rylstone-Cudgegong area); (b) establishing a biochronological framework for the Early Devonian succession by obtaining conodont faunas from the carbonates; (c) attempting correlation of the Kandos Group with platform margin units and Hill End Trough sequences; and (d) producing a synthesis of Early Devonian sedimentation and volcanism on the Capertee High and eastern Hill End Trough. Results show that the Kandos Group spans almost the entire Early Devonian and is separated from Late Silurian sequences by a widespread unconformity. The Kandos Group can be accurately correlated with the western platform margin sequences which are also dated by conodonts; however, correlation with the Hill End Trough succession is imprecise and relies on a small number of SHRIMP U/Pb zircon dates (which are inaccurately aligned with conodont zones) and rare <b>macrofaunas.</b> The Lochkovian portion of the Kandos Group is a transgressive to regressive shallow marine sequence deposited on a west- to southwest-sloping shelf flanked to the east by eroding sedimentary basement and active silicic volcanoes, and passing to the west into deepwater facies along the western margin of the High (basal Mullamuddy Formation) and in the eastern Hill End Trough (upper Crudine Group). Sedimentation in the Kandos Group began in the early Lochkovian woschmidti Zone and comprised (in ascending order) : a transgressive sequence of wave-dominated, fan-deltaic elastics (Warrah Conglomerate); a unit of transgressive biostromal to biohermal carbonates (Clandulla Limestone; woschmidti to eurekaensis Zones); a transgressive to regressive muddy, storm-influenced shelf deposit (Yellowmans Creek Formation; eurekaensis to delta Zones); and a thick regressive unit of storm-dominated siliciclastics deposited in middle shelf to nearshore settings (Roxburgh Formation; delta to pesavis or early sulcatus Zones). Facies prograded west during the late Lochkovian regression, culminating in shelf exposure and some erosion in the east. The early Lochkovian transgression may reflect a eustatic sea-level rise, whereas the late Lochkovian regression more likely indicates uplift of nearshore areas ahead of increasingly proximal volcanism. Thick sequences of dacitic to rhyolitic pyroclastics and volcaniclastics (Riversdale Volcanics and Huntingdale Volcanics) demonstrate that the Capertee High was dominated by subaerial silicic pyroclastic volcanism during the early to mid Pragian sulcatus and kindlei Zones. Medium-scale calderas, centred southeast of Cudgegong and in the eastern Capertee Valley, were flanked by extensive, shallowly-dipping sheets o f silicic ignimbrites and epiclastics which probably overlapped, forming a continuous sheet. Short-lived transgressions on the platform resulted in minor carbonate deposition during volcanically quiescent periods. Huge volumes of volcanic detritus were transported to the west and deposited as lowstand fans and aprons along the margin of the Capertee High (Mullamuddy and Kingsford Formations) and in the Hill End Trough (Merrions Formation). The Carwell Creek Formation overlies the Riversdale Volcanics and represents a possibly eustatic transgression in the latest Pragian to earliest Emsian (pireneae to dehiscens Zones) which initially reworked then drowned the existing volcanic topography, creating a broad southwest-sloping shelf with local eroding volcanic islands. Sedimentation in this setting was dominated by a laterally and temporally extensive regime of storm- and tidally-influenced nearshore to shelf siliciclastic sequences deposited in barrier island settings, along with local biostromal and biohermal carbonate buildups deposited in lagoonal and open-marine environments (Carwell Creek Formation, Myrtle Grove Formation and basal Mt Frome Limestone). Transgression cut off the supply of clastic detritus from slope and basin areas, and condensed mudstone sequences were deposited along the margin of the Capertee High (Warratra Mudstone and 2 ̆ 7 Rosedale Shale 2 ̆ 7) and in the Hill End Trough (basal Cunningham Formation). A transgressive pulse in the perbonus Zone was followed by regression, local platform exposure and erosion of platform areas in the middle Emsian (late perbonus to inversus Zones), and a number of carbonate aprons developed along the western margin of the High (basal Sutchers Creek Formation and Inglebum Formation). A transgression (possibly eustatic) resulted in further deposition of carbonates on the Capertee High during the late Emsian serotinus Zone (middle to upper Mt Frome Limestone and unpreserved equivalents). Regression later in the serotinus Zone resulted in erosion of some of these platform carbonates and redeposition in fans along the western margin of the Capertee High (Jesse Limestone and upper Sutchers Creek Formation). This regression probably continued into the earliest Eifelian partitus Zone, when carbonates of the Mt Frome Limestone were replaced by wave-dominated shoreline and shelf elastics of the Boogledie Formation. Deposition of this clastic sequence continued for an unknown length o f time into the early Eifelian before it was terminated by uplift and regression related to the mildly manifested Middle Devonian Tabberabberan deformation which effectively ended the depositional history of the Capertee High. Modem analogues for the Early Devonian Capertee High-Hill End Trough-Molong High exist in the Sumisu Rift (off the southeast coast of Japan), the southern Havre Trough (north of New Zealand), and the Sulu Sea (between Borneo and the Philippines).
