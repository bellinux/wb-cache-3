5|$|In 1734, he {{switched}} sides {{and joined the}} supported Augustus III. After several years of distrust, August III started treating Poniatowski {{as one of his}} major advisers. Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans for reform and strengthening the Commonwealth, however <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings. Those failures likely resulted in the his apathy, and he became much less active on the political scene in the 1750s. On 6 June 1752 he received the office of castellan of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} {{processing}} elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> a near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.|$|E

Odd, extraneous creatures, often a little depressed, feeling life slip away from them. The cinema was killing them.|$|R

5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive. The {{most stable}} {{of them are}} 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6days, 143Ce with a half-life of 33.04days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5days. All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Beonna's coins {{are known}} from two {{separate}} hoards, {{as well as}} from a number of individual finds. Until 1968, only five of his coins were known. Several more coins came to light over the next decade, before a hoard of sceattas and other coins were discovered in 1980 at Middle Harling, north-east of Thetford and close to the border between the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, {{protested the}} CIA's {{outsourcing}} of jobs. Previously in 2015, {{the school had}} terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut wages and benefits. Later that year, CCA joined the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU {{in order for the}} union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group. The workers are in grounds-keeping, recycling and painting at the school, where <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been employed for at least 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> oriel windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} not as many as those of Pandyas; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend {{and all of them}} depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses {{to participate and}} repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay {{if he does not}} meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing in}} Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, {{the number of}} {{documents}} written locally increased in the 7th century; though <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been lost. By {{the end of the}} 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to {{become an integral part of}} Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the Daigakuryo ("University") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.|$|E
