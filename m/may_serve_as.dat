5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised.

PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Mayfly nymphs <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some {{of these}} affect the nymphs' behaviour {{in such a}} way that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are {{responsible for most of}} the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> long as one who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a sound resonator.|$|E

5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
