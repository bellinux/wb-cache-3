40|$|Six Arabs {{subjects}} (three postpubertal, two prepubertal and one pubertal) {{from three}} interrelated Omani families with male pseudohermaphroditism due to 5 alpha-reductase- 2 deficiency were evaluated. These subjects {{had been raised}} as girls since birth as they were born with a clitoral-like phallus and ambiguous external genitalia of pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias with separate urethral and vaginal orifices. They underwent variable degrees of increased <b>muscular</b> <b>habitus</b> and phallic enlargement during puberty and beyond. Gynaecomastia was absent and the body and facial hair was insignificant. After diagnosis, a transition to male social sex occurred in two cases, {{one of which was}} interventional. Two retained the female social sex, one of which was also interventional, while the other two maintained an equivocal gender status. This report provides new data on the characterisation of 5 alpha-reductase- 2 deficiency in various clusters...|$|E
40|$|Robertsonian translocations {{are usually}} ascertained through {{abnormal}} children, making proposed phenotypic effects of apparently balanced translocations difficult {{to study in}} an unbiased way. From molecular genetic studies, though, some apparently balanced rearrangements are now known {{to be associated with}} phenotypic abnormalities resulting from uniparental disomy. Molecular explanations for other cases in which abnormality is seen in a balanced translocation carrier are being sought. In the present paper, an infant is described who has retarded growth, developmental delay, gross <b>muscular</b> hypotonia, slender <b>habitus,</b> frontal bossing, micrognathia, hooked nose, abundant wispy hair, and blue sclerae. Cytogenetically, she appeared to be a carrier of a balanced, paternally derived 14; 21 Robertsonian translocation. Analysis of DNA polymorphisms showed that she had no paternal allele at the D 14 S 13 locus (14 q 32). Study of additional DNA markers within 14 q 32 revealed that her previously undescribed phenotype results from an interstitial microdeletion within 14 q 32. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to show that this microdeletion had occurred de novo on the Robertsonian translocation chromosome. These observations may reactivate old suspicions of a causal association between Robertsonian translocations and de novo rearrangements in offspring; a systematic search for similar subcytogenetic rearrangements in other families, in which there are phenotypically abnormal children with apparently balanced translocations, may be fruitful. The clinical and molecular genetic data presented also define a new contiguous gene syndrome due to interstitial 14 q 32 deletion...|$|R
