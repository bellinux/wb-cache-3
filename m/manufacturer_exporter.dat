40|$|This study {{deals with}} the role of two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) to {{eliminate}} the child labor from garment industry Bangladesh and enroll those into schooling program. The first MoU signed in 1995 and the second MoU signed in 2000. This study focused on the initiatives taken to remove child labor and the programs that bring them into rehabilitation process. It is a secondary research and the study done in a mixed method way. Basically, it is a qualitative research and relies on content analysis of research. The information, about two MoUs and various programs taken to achieve the objectives of MoUs, was collected from the secondary sources. A tripartite and triangular model of social dialogue has been applied in the analysis. It is found from the study that the two MoUs achieved a contingent success during its operation. It has been done an outstanding job to remove under-aged children from the formal garment factories. The Bangladesh Garment <b>Manufacturer</b> <b>Exporter</b> Association recently declared that the formal garment is now free of child labor. However, the study indicates that child labor is still employed in both formal and informal garment factories. The study reveals that child labor rehabilitation programs was ineffective for many reasons. Firstly, there was no effective co-ordination between the partners during the two MoUs. The study also indicates that there was lack of management in the second MoU. Moreover, a small percentage of removed children received education and skill training. Secondly, lengthy rehabilitation projects approval and implementation of the projects encouraged children to leave rehabilitation programs and find another job. In addition, UNICEF, the leading partner of the two MoUs, had a small role during the second MoU due to the presence of small numbers of children in the school. All these factors hampered to ensure long-term benefit for the removed children...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{there has been a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the use of remote-controlled copters – often given the convenient but misleading epithets of unmanned aerial vehicles or “drones” – by recreational users to capture aerial photographs and videos on an unprecedented scale. Asia is no exception. The convergence of cutting-edge technological developments in gyroscopic gimbals, long-range wireless transmissions, GPS-enabled stabilisation, GPS-enabled flightpath-preprogramming, first-person-views, and compact digital imaging has led to the proliferation of affordable camera-carrying “drones” that even hobbyists can pilot with reasonable safety. Thus far, despite purported controversies there have not been any reports of serious mishaps involving the use of these rotor-propelled copters – mainly because these copters are incapable of heavy payloads and, in any event, have a series of fail-safe tools. Yet, there has been a consistent stream of public concern relating to issues of safety, privacy, and even the protection of monopolised commercial interests. Lost in the paranoid cacophony is a question that warrants proper legislative reflection: how can such tools be regulated {{in a way that is}} proportionate and sensible? There are some jurisdictions that have already tabled legislation to regulate recreational droning, while many others are planning to introduce the same, while some are relying on clearly anachronistic legislation as a stop-gap measure. Can the law keep pace with new technology, or is the challenge too formidable? How is Asia – the principal <b>manufacturer,</b> <b>exporter,</b> and user of many of these copters – responding to the situation? This paper, presented at the 2015 ASLI Conference, will examine some of the laws in the region and beyond to demonstrate how the right balance between the freedom of expression and freedom to create art, and the purported competing demands of safety, privacy, and commercial interests can be struck – or not. Questions relating to the appropriate height, distance, weight, airbase-proximity, and line of sight limits; the necessity of a licensing and/or training scheme; and the supposed problems of privacy intrusion and obstruction of commercial interests will be addressed. Ultimately, however, what is needed first and foremost is a complete mind-set shift in the legislators before one goes down the path of no return...|$|E

The report also indicated that building owner Sohel Rana may have been able to corrupt municipal officials by offering bribes.|$|R
