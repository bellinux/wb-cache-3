The <b>Moonies</b> are a three piece who hail from The Beatles end of Liverpool, but if you’re expecting their location to be obvious in their sound, then you’re going to be disappointed. Taking their cues from the antics of Keith Moon and the sound of The Who and Ash, The <b>Moonies</b> are a hedonistic hit band waiting to happen. 'Blue' is melodic rock with Americana vocals that repeat ‘I’m so blue, without you’ over pop chords and a cute use of scratching to cover swearing. 'So Good', meanwhile, is a three-minute whirlwind of Buzzcocks guitar and lilting harmonies that belong in your finest emo effort. You may not have heard of the <b>Moonies</b> yet, but judging by the exuberance and pop sensibilities of their debut, you’ll be hearing of them in the future. — 7/10" [...] — Natalie Boxall, BBC Manchester, 13 May 2002 ...|$|E
