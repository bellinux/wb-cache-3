40|$|This paper {{describes}} the high precision digital sun sensor under {{development at the}} University of Naples. The sensor determines the sun line orientation in the sensor frame from the measurement of the sun position on the focal plane. It exploits CMOS technology and an original optical head design with <b>multiple</b> <b>apertures.</b> This allows simultaneous multiple acquisitions of the sun as spots on the focal plane. The sensor can be operated either with a fixed or a variable number of sun spots, depending on the required field of view and sun-line measurement precision. Multiple acquisitions are averaged by using techniques which minimize the computational load to extract the sun line orientation with high precision. Accuracy and computational efficiency are also improved thanks to an original design of the calibration function relying on neural networks. Extensive test campaigns are carried out using a laboratory test facility reproducing sun spectrum, apparent size and distance, and variable illumination directions. Test results validate the sensor concept, confirming the precision improvement achievable with <b>multiple</b> <b>apertures,</b> and sensor operation with a variable number of sun spots.

40|$|AbstractAmblyopes {{exhibit a}} global motion anomaly that implicates {{processing}} beyond the local motion analysis of V 1 possibly involving areas MT and MST in the extra-striate cortex. Here, {{we sought to}} further investigate this deficit by measuring the perception of moving plaid stimuli by amblyopic observers, since there is good physiological evidence that the motion of such stimuli is determined by processes beyond V 1. The conditions under which the two moving components constituting the plaids were seen to cohere or move transparently over one another were investigated by manipulating their relative spatial frequencies. Percepts were measured using both short presentation durations, where both the percept and the direction of motion were reported, and long presentation durations where the bi-stability of the stimulus was directly measured. In addition, we measured the ability of amblyopic eyes to perceive globally coherent motion in a <b>multiple</b> <b>aperture</b> stimulus. We found a small increased tendency for both amblyopic and fellow-fixing eyes to perceive short duration plaid stimuli as coherent relative to control eyes, but no difference for long duration plaids. In addition, amblyopic eyes saw less coherence in <b>multiple</b> <b>aperture</b> stimuli than fellow-fixing eyes but were not reliably different from control eyes. We therefore conclude that the neural mechanisms underlying plaid perception are only subtly abnormal in amblyopia...|$|R

40|$|When {{the iris}} of a {{conventional}} camera {{is replaced by a}} mask with <b>multiple</b> <b>apertures,</b> a composite image is formed. Unlike binocular stereopsis, the views from each aperture are superimposed, so that conventional methods in stereo vision do not apply. Still, the local displacement between corresponding points in these views is related to their distance from the camera. This depth cue provides the basis for a new paradigm in passive range sensing [...] monocular stereopsis. This thesis presents a technique for computing a dense range image from one composite image acquired with a <b>multiple</b> <b>aperture</b> camera. The formation of the composite image is modelled as an echo process, where the depth of a point in the scene {{is directly related to the}} spatial delay of its visual echo. Cepstral analysis is the method used to detect this echo. A model of the composite image cepstrum allows measurement of monocular disparity to subpixel precision, as well as an estimate of its associated error distribution. This data, computed over a dense grid, is used to generate a piecewise planar representation of surfaces in the scene, based on a maximum likelihood criterion. Borrowing techniques from visual psychophysics, the spatial resolution of this result is evaluated in terms of an intelligent agent making decisions about its environment. This new range imaging technique is successfully applied to real-world scenes to demonstrate its potential for mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance...|$|R
