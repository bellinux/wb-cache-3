5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> are being themselves. Some LARPs encourage players to stay consistently in character except in emergencies, while others accept players being out-of-character at times. In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know may be viewed as cheating.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} World War II was over, the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into disrepair. They had been {{neglected}} throughout the Great Depression and wartime. In 1959, the City of Minneapolis presented {{a plan for}} the Seward neighborhood, which listed the houses on Milwaukee Avenue in 'deteriorated' condition, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> had no indoor plumbing or were severely battered.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E
50|$|Leptons are {{particles}} of spin-, <b>meaning</b> that <b>they</b> are fermions. They carry an electric charge of −1 e (charged leptons) or 0 e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry colour charge, <b>meaning</b> that <b>they</b> do not experience the strong interaction. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, <b>meaning</b> that <b>they</b> {{are subject to}} the weak interaction. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.|$|R

5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E

5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> replace {{legs and}} feet that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

5|$|The spores are elliptical, {{wrinkled}} {{or slightly}} warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5μm. They are nonamyloid, <b>meaning</b> <b>they</b> {{have a negative}} color reaction with the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing structures, the basidia, are elongated or club-shaped, hyaline (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5μm. G.clavatus does not contain cystidia, the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|Troels Brun Folmann {{composed}} the main {{theme of the}} game, and was the music supervisor for Underworld while Colin O'Malley was scoring {{the bulk of the}} music.

The score is made more of musical fragments, similar to the first five games of the Tomb Raider series, and there is less constant music than in Legend.|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career.

His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E
