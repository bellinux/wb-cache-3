40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of a system can start {{with the creation of}} a specification. Following this viewpoint, we claim that often a specification can be constructed from the combination of specifications which can be seen as composition. Event-B is a formal method that allows modelling and refinement of systems. The combination, reuse and validation of component specifications are not currently supported in Event-B. We extend the Event-B formalism using shared event composition as an option for developing (distributed) systems. Refinement is used in the {{development of}} specifications using <b>composed</b> <b>machines</b> and we prove that properties and proof obligations of specifications can be reused to ensure valid composed specifications. The main contributions of this work are the Event-B extension to support shared event composition and refinement including the proof obligations <b>for</b> a <b>composed</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

[...] Burder is also noted for a series of letters, combined into a work entitled Burder's Letters from a Senior to a Junior Physician: on the Importance of Promoting the Religious Welfare of his Patients. After he had retired from his practice, a suggestion from James Hope induced him to author the letters, which eventually appeared in the Evangelical <b>Magazine</b> <b>for</b> 1836. <b>Composed</b> at Tilford in Surrey, they were popular reading material among 19th century British medical students and physicians.

40|$|UML-B is a UML-like {{graphical}} {{front end}} for Event-B that provides support for object- oriented modelling concepts. In particular, UML-B supports class diagrams and state machines, concepts {{that are not}} explicitly supported in plain Event-B. In Event-B, refinement is used to relate system models at different abstraction levels. The same abstraction-refinement concepts can also be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the notions of refined classes, refined state machines and extended classtypes to en- able refinement of classes and state machines in UML-B. This work makes explicit the structures of class and state machine refinement in UML-B. This work also introduces seven refinement techniques which are, adding new attributes and associations, adding new classes, elaborating state, elaborating transition, moving a class event (or a state machine transition), adding new attributes and associations, and adding new classtypes. In Event-B, decomposition is used to decompose a system into components. The same decomposition concepts can be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the techniques of flattening state machines and state grouping to facilitate a decomposition of a UML-B machine. This work also introduces the notion of <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> which <b>composes</b> the component <b>machines.</b> The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> refines a machine which is being decomposed. The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> is used to ensure {{the composition of the}} component machines is a valid refinement. Together with the <b>composed</b> UML-B <b>machine,</b> the notions of included <b>machine,</b> <b>composed</b> event and constituent event are introduced. The UML-B drawing tool and Event-B translator are extended to support the new refinement and decomposition concepts. A case study of an auto teller machine (ATM) is presented to validate the extensions of UML-B with regards to the above notions. The ATM case study also demonstrates the above techniques introduced in refinement and decomposition. In addition, this work provides guidelines for performing refinement and decomposition in UML-B and presents a number of generic invariants that may be used when refining a middleware. The middleware is a component via which a requesting component such as an ATM and a responding component such as bank interact in a distributed system.

40|$|As {{we enter}} the era of {{petascale}} computing, system architects must plan <b>for</b> <b>machines</b> <b>composed</b> of tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} processors. Although fully connected networks such as fattree configurations currently dominate HPC interconnect designs, such approaches are inadequate for such ultra-scale concurriencies due to the superlinear growth of component costs. Traditional low-degree interconnect topologies, such as 3 D tori, have reemerged as a competitive solution due to the linear scaling of system components relative to the node count; however, such networks are poorly suited for the requirements of many scientific applications at extreme concurrencies. To address these limitations, we propose HFAST, a hybrid switch architecture that uses circuit switches to dynamically reconfigure lower-degree interconnects to suit the topological requirements of a given scientific application. This work presents several new research contributions. We develop an optimization strategy for HFAST mappings and demonstrate that efficiency gains can be attained across a broad range of static numerical computations. Additionally, we conduct an extensive analysis of the communication characteristics of a dynamically adapting mesh calculation and show that the HFAST approach can achieve significant performance advantages, even when compared with traditional fat-tree configurations. Overall results point to the promising potential of utilizing hybrid reconfigurable networks to interconnect future petascale architectures, for both static and dynamically adapting applications. ...|$|R

We present our latest work on a hybrid switch architecture called HFAST that uses circuit switches to dynamically reconfigure a lower-degree interconnect to suit the topological requirements of each scientific application. This paper expands upon our prior work on the requirements of non-adaptive applications by analyzing the communication characteristics of dynamically adapting AMR code and presents a methodology that captures the evolving communication requirements. We also present a new optimization that computes the under-utilization of fat-tree interconnects for a given communication topology, showing the potential of constructing a ''fit-tree'' for the application by using the HFAST circuit switches to provision an optimal interconnect topology for each application. Finally, we apply our new optimization technique to the communication requirements of the AMR code to demonstrate the potential of using dynamic reconfiguration of the HFAST interconnect between the communication intensive phases of a dynamically adapting application...|$|R
