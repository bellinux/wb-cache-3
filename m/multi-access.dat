2500|$|DR's {{exist for}} the purpose of {{reducing}} network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a <b>multi-access</b> network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address 224.0.0.6. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address 224.0.0.5. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. [...] The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. [...] DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. [...] DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast <b>Multi-Access)</b> networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. [...] DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.|$|E
5000|$|In biology or medicine, a <b>multi-access</b> key is an {{identification}} key which overcomes {{the problem of}} the more traditional single-access keys (dichotomous or polytomous identification keys) of requiring a fixed sequence of identification steps.

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{distributed}}-queue dual-bus network (DQDB) is a distributed <b>multi-access</b> {{network that}} (a) supports integrated communications using a dual bus and distributed queuing, (b) {{provides access to}} local or metropolitan area networks, and (c) supports connectionless data transfer, connection-oriented data transfer, and isochronous communications, such as voice communications.|$|E

50|$|SOTELMA {{the state}} telecom, {{provides}} X.25 and dial-up telephone services. Many operators offer dial-up internet service, and wireless internet services. Most ISPs are small Bamako based providers with a VSAT connection, a cyber cafe and use wireless systems (Alviron, 802.11a,b, g, Motorola) {{to share their}} service with their clients. Bamako has at least 21 wireless providers, ranging from small VSAT operators, to sophisticated, <b>multi-access</b> point, full services providers.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{identification}} keys {{have most}} commonly taken {{the form of}} single-access keys. These work by offering a fixed sequence of identification steps, each with multiple alternatives, the choice of which determines the next step. If each step has only two alternatives, the key {{is said to be}} dichotomous, else it is polytomous. Modern <b>multi-access</b> or interactive keys allow the user to freely choose the identification steps and their order.|$|E
50|$|Almost every {{household}} is able {{to access}} dial-up, thanks to Chorus inheriting the formerly state-owned copper phone network. For the ten thousand most remote households, their phone lines are connected back to the exchange via a radio system called customer <b>multi-access</b> radio (CMAR). These households can only access 14.4 kbit/s speeds. As of October 2015, there were 53,000 dial-up connections (3% of all connections), down from 99,000 (5%) in 2013, and 127,000 (7%) in 2012.|$|E
50|$|OS4000 Rel 3 arrived around 1980, and {{included}} Linked-OS — support for Linked OS4000 operating systems to enable multi-node systems to be constructed. The main customer {{for this was}} the central computing service of University College London (Euclid), where a multi-node system consisting of a Hub file server and multiple Rim <b>multi-access</b> compute server systems provided service for over 100 simultaneous users. Linked-OS was also used to construct fail-over Process control systems with higher resilience.|$|E
50|$|Online {{transaction}} processing (OLTP) {{is characterized by}} a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in <b>multi-access</b> environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually 3NF). Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.|$|E
50|$|Since {{traditional}} PPP {{connections are}} established between two end points over a serial link or over an ATM virtual circuit {{that has already}} been established during dial-up, all PPP frames sent on the wire are sure to reach the other end. But Ethernet networks are <b>multi-access</b> where each node in the network can access every other node. An Ethernet frame contains the hardware address of the destination node (MAC address). This helps the frame reach the intended destination.|$|E
