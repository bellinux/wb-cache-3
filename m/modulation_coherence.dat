Am. 86, 2148 - 2159 (1989) ] found that when three simultaneous vowels at different pitches were presented with subaudio frequency modulation, subjects judged them as being more prominent than when no vibrato was present. In a normal voice, when the harmonics of a vowel undergo frequency modulation they also undergo an amplitude modulation that traces the spectral envelope. Hypothetically, this spectral tracing {{could be one of the}} criteria used by the ear to group components of each vowel, which may help explain the lack of effect of frequency <b>modulation</b> <b>coherence</b> among different vowels in the previous study. In this experiment, two types of vowel synthesis were used in which the component amplitudes of each vowel either remained constant with frequency modulation or traced the spectral envelope.

40|$|The masking release {{associated}} with coherent amplitude modulation of the masker {{is dependent on}} the degree of envelope coherence across frequency, with the largest masking release for stimuli with perfectly comodulated envelopes. Experiments described here tested the hypothesis that the effects of reducing envelope coherence depend on the unique envelope features of the on-signal masker as compared to the flanking maskers. Maskers were amplitude-modulated tones (Experiments 1 and 3) or amplitude-modulated bands of noise (Experiment 2), and the signal was a tone; across-frequency masker coherence was manipulated to assess the effects of introducing additional modulation minima in either the on-signal or flanking masker envelopes of otherwise coherently modulated maskers. In all three experiments, the detrimental effect of disrupted <b>modulation</b> <b>coherence</b> was more severe when additional modulation minima were introduced in the flanking as compared to on-signal masker envelopes. This was the case for both ipsilateral and contralateral flanking masker presentations, indicating that within-channel cues were not responsible for this finding.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{detection}} of distributed faults in ball bearings. In literature most of the authors focus their attention on the detection of incipient localized defects. In that case classical techniques (i. e. statistical parameters, envelope analysis) are robust in recognizing {{the presence of the}} fault and its characteristic frequency. In this paper the authors focalize their attention on bearings affected by distributed faults, due to the progressive growing of surface wear or to low-quality manufacturing process. These faults can not be detected by classical techniques; in fact, in this case the signal does not contain impulses at the fault characteristic frequency, but more complex components with strong non-stationary contents. Distributed faults are here detected by means of advanced tools directly derived from the theory of cyclostationarity. In particular three metrics - namely Integrated Cyclic Coherence (ICC), Integrated Cyclic <b>Modulation</b> <b>Coherence</b> (ICMC) and Indicator of Second-Order Cyclostationarity (ICS 2 x) - have been calculated in order to condense the information given by the cyclostationary analysis and to help the analyst in detecting the fault in a fast fault diagnosis procedure. These indicators are applied on actual signals captured on a test rig where a degreased bearing running under radial load developed accelerated wear. The results indicated that all the three cyclostationary indicators are able to detect both the appearance of a localized fault and its development in a distributed fault, whilst the usual approach fails as the fault grows...|$|E

40|$|Networks of {{synchronized}} fast-spiking interneurons {{are thought}} to be key elements in the generation of gamma (Œ≥) oscillations (30 - 80 Hz) in the brain. We examined how such Œ≥-oscillatory inhibition regulates the output of a cortical pyramidal cell. Specifically, we modeled a situation where a pyramidal cell receives inputs from Œ≥-synchronized fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. This model successfully reproduced several important aspects of a recent experimental result regarding the Œ≥-inhibitory regulation of pyramidal cellular firing that is presumably associated with the sensation of whisker stimuli. Through an in-depth analysis of this model system, we show that there is an obvious rhythmic gating effect of the Œ≥-oscillated interneuron networks on the pyramidal neuron's signal transmission. This effect is further illustrated by the interactions of this interneuron network and the pyramidal neuron. Prominent power in the Œ≥ frequency range can emerge provided that there are appropriate delays on the excitatory connections and inhibitory synaptic conductance between interneurons. These results indicate that interactions between excitation and inhibition are critical for the <b>modulation</b> of <b>coherence</b> and oscillation frequency of network activities.

40|$|In {{this article}} we used biologically {{plausible}} simulations of coupled neuronal populations to address the relationship between phasic and fast coherent neuronal interactions and macroscopic measures of activity that are integrated over time, such as the BOLD response in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Event-related, dynamic correlations were assessed using joint peristimulus time histograms and, in particular, the mutual information between stimulus-induced transients in two populations. This mutual information {{can be considered as}} an index of functional connectivity. Our simulations showed that functional connectivity or dynamic integration between two populations increases with mean background activity and stimulus-related rate modulation. Furthermore, as the background activity increases, the populations become increasingly sensitive to the intensity of the stimulus in terms of a predisposition to transient phase locking. This reflects an interaction between background activity and stimulus intensity in producing dynamic correlations, in that background activity augments stimulus-induced <b>coherence</b> <b>modulation.</b> This is interesting from a computational perspective because background activity establishes a context that may {{have a profound effect on}} eventrelated interactions or functional connectivity between neuronal populations. Finally, total firing rates, which subsume both background activity and stimulus-related rate modulation, were almost linearly related to the expression of dynamic correlations over large ranges of activities. These observations show that under the assumptions implicit in our model, rate-specific metrics based on rate or <b>coherence</b> <b>modulation</b> may be different perspectives on the same underlying dynamics. This suggests that activity (averaged over all peristimulus times), as measured in neuroimaging, may be tightly coupled to the expression of dynamic correlations...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{decoherence}} of electron spins in semiconductors due {{to their}} interaction with nuclear spins is of fundamental interest as they realize the central spin model and of practical importance for using electron spins as qubits. Interesting effects arise from the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear spins with electric field gradients, which {{have been shown to}} suppress diffusive nuclear spin dynamics. One might thus expect them to enhance electron spin coherence. Here we show experimentally that for gate-defined GaAs quantum dots, quadrupolar broadening of the nuclear Larmor precession can also reduce electron spin coherence due to faster decorrelation of transverse nuclear fields. However, this effect can be eliminated for appropriate field directions. Furthermore, we observe an additional <b>modulation</b> of spin <b>coherence</b> that can be attributed to an anisotropic electronic $g$-tensor.

40|$|Neuronal {{oscillations}} are {{a characteristic}} feature of neuronal activity and are typically investigated through measures {{of power and}} coherence.

We use this method to identify the sensorimotor alpha and beta rhythms in ongoing magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, and to study their attentional <b>modulation.</b> Using lagged <b>coherence,</b> the sensorimotor rhythms become visible in ongoing activity as local rhythmicity peaks that are separated from the strong posterior activity in the same frequency bands.

We go on to show that the attentional modulation of these rhythms is also evident in lagged coherence and moreover, that in contrast to power, it can be visualised even without an experimental contrast.

We made multi-channel microelectrode recordings of multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from striate cortex (V 1) during BR while the monkey indicated his perception by pushing a lever. We analyzed spectral power and coherence of MUA and LFP over 4 ‚Äì 90 Hz. As in previous work, coherence of Œ≥-signals in most pairs of recording locations strongly depended on grating orientation when stimuli were presented congruently in both eyes. With incongruent (rivalrous) stimulation LFP power was often consistently modulated in consonance with the perceptual state. This was not visible in MUA.

Nine seated subjects were perturbed in lateral direction on a motion platform while GVS was simultaneously applied.

For the motion perturbations, two direction and two amplitude variations were included. The GVS signal was applied in a bilateral bipolar configuration at 4 mA. During trials subjects had their eyes closed and were asked to perform a natural stabilization task. Displacements of the head, torso and platform were recorded using a motion capture system. System identification techniques were used to identify the relationship between respectively inputs GVS and torso motion and output head motion. Results show that it is feasible to apply low-level torso perturbations together with continuous galvanic stimulation in studying the head-neck system as high coherencies and consistent behavior are found for the transfer functions from mechanical and galvanic inputs to head motion over all subjects.

Brain and behavioral responses to optic flow undergo considerable postnatal maturation, but relatively little brain imaging evidence describes {{the time course of}} development in motion processing systems in early to middle childhood, a time when psychophysical data suggest that there are changes in sensitivity. To fill this gap, electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were recorded in 4 - to 8 -year-old children who viewed three time-varying optic flow patterns (translation, rotation, and radial expansion/contraction) at three different speeds (2, 4, and 8 deg/s). Modulations of global motion coherence evoked coherent EEG responses at the first harmonic that differed by flow pattern and responses at the third harmonic and dot update rate that varied by speed. Pattern-related responses clustered over right lateral channels while speed-related responses clustered over midline channels. Both children and adults show widespread responses to <b>modulations</b> of motion <b>coherence</b> at the second harmonic that are not selective for pattern or speed.

Long coherence times due to their weak interactionwith the environment and the electrical tunability of the semiconductor quantum dot have allowed GaAs-based spin qubits to {{play a central role in}} demonstrating the keyoperations of semiconductor spin qubits, such as initialization, read-out, universal control and two-qubit gates. Furthermore, spins {{confined in}} semiconductor nanostructuresprovide a solid-state approach to quantum computation which leverages current, well established semiconductor production technology for device fabrication and potential scalability. However, the interaction with nuclear spins in the GaAs host material complicates not only the preservation of qubit coherence, but also the precise control of the electronspins. As both these properties, the coherence time and the fidelity of gate operations, play a crucial role as prerequisites for quantum computing, the focus of this thesis areexperiments addressing these challenges on the basis of two-electron spin qubits. Interesting effects arise from the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear spins with electric field gradients. We show experimentally that quadrupolar broadening of the nuclear Larmor precession reduces electron spin coherence via faster decorrelation of transversenuclear fields. However, this effect disappears for appropriate field directions. Furthermore, we observe an additional <b>modulation</b> of <b>coherence</b> attributed to an anisotropicelectronic g-tensor. These results complete our understanding of dephasing in gated quantum dots and point to mitigation strategies. A key requirement for quantum computation are high-fidelity single qubit operations, which so far have not been demonstrated for encoded qubits in GaAs. Here, we realize such accurate operations by iteratively tuning of the all-electrical control pulses. Using randomized benchmarking, a well established characterization method, we find anaverage gate fidelity of F = (98. 5 ¬± 0. 1) % and determine the sum of gate leakage out of and back into the computational subspace to be L = (0. 4 ¬± 0. 1) %.

How does this selection process occur {{and how does it}} affect the flow of sensory processing within the hierarchically structured networks? How does our brain know which information to discard and which to enhance, and more crucially, in which order to operate these two sides of the selection process? Previous studies in the non-human primate brain have shown how selective spatial attention to a visual target positively modulates overall time-averaged coherence values across electrode groups implanted in the sensory visual cortex. In this study, we focus on the modulation of neural activity, and specifically on neuronal communication between distant networks within visual processing streams within and beyond the human primary visual cortex through the scope of human intracranial recordings performed in epileptic patients. We specifically focus on the temporal profile of the modulation of local oscillatory power responses and distant <b>coherence</b> <b>modulations</b> between recording sites, in a frequency range from theta to high-gamma (4 ‚Äì 80 Hz). We show that selectively orienting spatial attention through endogenous cuing (left versus right) on bilateral dynamic gratings may produce a response pattern that in time first actively inhibits long-distant communication in the ipsi-lateral hemisphere, which processes distractor information, before enhancing communication in the contra-lateral hemisphere, which processes the selected target. We show these effects are frequency specific and reveal the underlying mechanism for selectively routing sensory visual information across brain networks...|$|R
