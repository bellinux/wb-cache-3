40|$|The {{rates of}} {{utilization}} of energy-yielding substrates (glucose and oxygen) by Penicillium chrysogenum in glucose-limited chemostat cultures were resolved into requirements or ‘rations ’ {{for growth and}} maintenance. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> of glucose was almost all oxidized to carbon dioxide. Over the growth rate range 0. 023 - 0. 075 hr-l only vegetative growth occurred; although the filamentous growth form predominated, the occurrence of pellets and swollen organisms increased with growth rate. At growth rates of 0. 014 hr-l and below, conidiation occurred and was maximal at a specific growth rate of 0. 009 hr-l (average doubling time 78 hr). After growth in chemostat culture the organism could be maintained in a non-growing state by supplying only the <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> of glucose (0. 022 g. glucose/g. mycelial dry wt/hr). When growth in the chemostat was suddenly stopped by stopping the glucose feed, the mould autolyzed; autolysis was prevented by supplying the <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> of glucose. When the glucose feed rate in chemostat cultures was decreased to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration,</b> mycelial differentiation occurred. Differentiation involved increased hyphal vacuo-lation, a decreased degree of oxidation of glucose, breakdown and re-synthesis of nucleic acids and conidiation. The rates at which these changes occurred {{were inversely related to}} the growth rate prior to stopping growth. For maximum conidia formation there was an optimal glucose feed rate about 0. 038 g. glucose/g. mycelial dry wt/hr, that is 1 - 7 x <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration.</b> The <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> of glucose was shown {{to play a role in}} pre-venting autolysis and facilitating conidiation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{effects of}} {{temperature}}, temperature fluctuation, and fish size {{on the growth}} of juvenile steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) were studied in experiments which lasted 10 to 25 days. Groups of fish were fed at ration levels varying from near-starvation to repletion. Decelerating, curvilinear relationships between rates of food consumption and growth were defined {{in most of the}} experiments. At <b>ration</b> levels near <b>maintenance,</b> temperatures elevated 3 and 6 C above the seasonal ambient temperatures decreased the growth of the trout. As feeding rate increased, the detrimental effect of temperature on growth was ameliorated. At repletion feeding levels, elevation of temperature up to approximately 17 C increased trout growth rates by increasing the maximum food consumption rates of the fish. With temperature increase from 6. 9 to 22. 5 C the <b>maintenance</b> <b>rations</b> of the trout increased from 2. 2 to 7. 4 % body weight/day. Large diel temperature fluctuations of 4 and 8 C did not increase growth rates and in some cases decreased growth rates to levels below those of fish kept at constant temperatures. Increase of fish size from 0. 58 to 3. 36 g decreased the <b>maintenance</b> <b>rations</b> (per gram of tissue) of the trout. This decrease was attributed to decreases in metabolic rate that are associated with increases in fish size. As a consequence of this size-dependent change in metabolic rate, large fish grew faster than small fish at low ration levels. However, at ration levels greater than 9 %/day, small fish grew faster than large fish. At the highest ration levels fed (9 - 12 %/day) gross food conversion efficiency of the large fish began to decline, while efficiencies of small fish continued to increase with increases in ration size. Periodic sampling of steelhead trout in a small coastal stream indicated that growth rates of these wild trout ranged from - 0. 18 to 1. 6 %/day. Food consumption rates of the wild trout were estimated to range from 2. 0 to 7. 6 %/day; considerably less than the maximum consumption rates of trout kept in the laboratory.

Supplementation with lupin grain significantly increased ovulation rate by 37 % by increasing the proportion of ewes with two ovulations. Similar increases in ovulation rate were achieved by increasing the supply of digestible protein post-ruminally in the casein and casein + starch-supplement groups. Increasing the intake of digestible energy separately in the starch-supplement group did not increase ovulation rate. It is concluded that increases in ovulation rate in ewes fed a lupin supplement are the result of significant increases in the amount of protein digested post-ruminally...|$|E

The factorial model was subsequently used to calculate theoretical changes in the optimum ratio of DP:DE (g DP MJ DE− 1) and estimate changes in the theoretical feed conversion ratio (FCR) or feed intake with increasing fish size. Growth of S. lalandi was described by the function; growth (g fish− 1 d− 1) = 0. 268 ± 0. 33 BW (g) 0. 52 ± 0. 2. Body weight exponents for protein or energy loss in S. lalandi {{were found to be}} statistically similar to 0. 7 or 0. 8, respectively. Maintenance requirements for DP were found to be 1. 70 g DP BW (kg) − 0. 7 d− 1 while those for DE were found to be 87. 44 kJ BW (kg) − 0. 8 d− 1. Utilisation coefficients for DP or DE estimated from linear regressions which incorporated data above and below <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> were 0. 51 and 0. 65, respectively. However, regressions which excluded data below <b>maintenance</b> <b>ration</b> returned coefficients of 0. 41 (DP) and 0. 55 (DE). The partial energetic efficiencies of protein (KP) and lipid (KL) deposition as estimated by multiple linear regression were 0. 61 and 0. 83, respectively. Piecewise linear regression analysis was applied to the curvilinear response of DP:DE on increasing fish weight in order to differentiate key growth stages in the production of S. lalandi. Three stages were identified; a juvenile stage ≤ 200 g, an intermediate stage between 200 and 1000 g and a stage for fish ≥ 1000 g. These stages corresponded to DP:DE requirements of 38, 31 and 24 g DP MJ DE− 1, respectively. Practical diet formulations that would best meet the DP:DE criteria for fish ≤ 200 g are those which contain approximately 456 g DP kg− 1 and 12 MJ DE kg− 1. For fish growing between 200 and 1000 g a diet containing 465 g DP kg− 1 and 15 MJ DE kg− 1 would be suitable while a diet containing 432 g DP kg− 1 and 18 MJ DE kg− 1 would be appropriate for fish ≥ 1000 g.

The deprived groups were reduced to a mean mass of c. 80 % of controls. The compensatory growth response shown when ad libitum feeding was resumed was independent of the trajectory by which the three-spined sticklebacks had reached the reduced body mass. The compensatory response was sufficient to return the deprived groups to the mass and length trajectories shown by the control group within 4 weeks. There was full compensation for dry mass and total lipid, but incomplete compensation for lipid-free dry mass. Hyperphagia and increased growth efficiency {{were present in the}} re-feeding phase, but there was a lag of a week before the hyperphagia was established. The consistency of the compensatory response of immature three-spined sticklebacks provides a potential model system for the analysis and prediction of appetite and growth in teleosts.

40|$|Deer {{foraging}} on tree seedlings {{is recognized}} as the most widespread detriment to reforestation efforts. Non-lethal approaches to reduce deer damage to seedlings are highly desirable. Avoidance of natural secondary metabolites contained in conifers may provide feasible means to develop non-lethal measures. Other {{studies have demonstrated that}} sheep and goats fed diets with high protein-to-energy ratios, or allowed to select between concentrates high in either energy or protein, ate much more of a high-terpene diet and of a high-tannin diet than when they were fed diets high in energy-to-protein ratios. Thus, manipulating foraging options for deer may impact their ability to ingest terpenes contained in coders. We conducted a series of studies to determine whether deer acceptance of terpene-containing foods can be affected by altering the ratio of energy and protein in their maintenance diet. We determined relative consumption of a high-energy and low-protein diet, and a low-energy and high-protein diet, when deer are given the opportunity to self-regulate their intake. We also determined if deer modified their relative intake of these diets when offered an alternative terpene-treated diet. Penned deer were offered variable diets (e. g., high energy-low protein, low-energy-high protein, or both foods), then their acceptance of terpene- and tannin-containing foods was determined Deer consumed more and demonstrated a strong preference for the high-energy diet relative to the high-protein diet. However, the varied diets did not appear to affect their intake of terpene or tannin-containing foods. This paper discusses the potential of manipulating <b>maintenance</b> <b>rations</b> as a non-lethal tool, presents initial results and possible explanations for differences between our study with deer and prior work with domestic ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Cereal crop {{residues}} (straw, chaff, etc.) are important components of <b>maintenance</b> <b>rations</b> for ruminant livestock {{in many parts}} of the world. They are especially important in small-holder crop-livestock production systems in the sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid tropics and subtropics where most of the world's poorest livestock producers and consumers are found. Taking as examples tropically adapted cereals in the crop improvement mandate of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), namely pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], this paper explores opportunities for using marker-assisted crop breeding methods to improve the quality and quantity of cereal {{crop residues}} for use as ruminant livestock feedstuffs. In the case of pearl millet, ICRISAT has been heavily involved with several UK-based collaborating research institutes, in development and initial application of the molecular genetic tools for marker-assisted breeding. We have obtained some useful experience in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for stover yield, foliar disease resistance, and in vitro estimates of the nutritive value of various stover fractions for ruminants. In sorghum, ICRISAT has focused on initiating a large-scale high-throughput marker-assisted backcrossing program for the stay-green component of terminal drought tolerance - a trait that is likely to be associated not only with more stable grain and stover yield, but which is also expected to contribute to maintenance of ruminant nutritional value of stover produced under drought stress conditions. Conventional and marker-assisted breeding for foliar disease resistance is recommended for dual-purpose cereal improvement, or indeed for improvement of the nutritional value of residues for any crop in which these are used as feedstuffs for ruminant livestock. Practical problems faced and proposed ways of dealing with these are discussed...|$|R
