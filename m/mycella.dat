50|$|In {{the city}} of Antheum, carried by a magical beast called Anthedon (a large skybound whale), young Princess <b>Mycella</b> prayed in the mystic Chamber of Rites to summon a hero who will save her world from the growing threat posed by Gandrake Enterprises. However, Rothschild {{interrupts}} the ritual, which causes the summoned hero - Musashi - to land just a bit off course. He's found by old martial artist Master Mew, who immediately takes him under his wing. Once Musashi's ready, Master Mew sends him {{into the heart of}} evil Gandrake Enterprises to rescue the captured Princess and thereby save the world.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} two fungi (Scopularlopsis brevlcaulis & Phaeolus schweinitzii) to {{accumulate}} arsenic (As) was investigated {{and the most}} tolerant species (S. brevicaulic) selected for further study, Growth on malt and Czapek-dox media was compared, together with the growth response {{to a change in}} medium concentration, pH. available light intensity, and the addition of arsenite, selenium, tellurium, and industrial effluent As. The maximum concentration (concn.) of arsenate tolerated by the fungus was defined. An ability to grow in petri dishes, shake flasks and a chemostat was tested, to determine the potential of this fungus for large scale production. Swab samples were taken from As contaminated, industrial areas to detect the presence of microorganisms. The potential uptake of As by mycelia growing in malt and floating on a 1 % glucose solution was monitored via the application of two As assays. Only mats of <b>mycella</b> floating on glucose exhibited a significant decline in medium As concn [...] A third test was employed to determine the amount of As taken up by the <b>mycella</b> and showed more As present in fungi grown on malt than the floating oats. The use of this test to detect the volatile end product of As accumulation (trimethylarslne) did not yield any conclusive results. Extracellular or Intracellular enzymes Involved in the uptake and volatilisation of As could not be found. A change in mediumviscosity, associated with growth In the presence of As. was found to be linked to qualitative rather than quantitative changes in medium components, by the use of biochemical tests, microscopic investigation and polyacrlamide gel electrophoresis...|$|E

The presence of the fields of the limited mixing of the components in <b>mycella,</b> low-temperature fields of the mixtures colloid solubility, has been established. The colloid-chemical principles of selection of the PAS - dispergators of the calcium soaps have been formulated. The synergic effect has been detected in preventing from calcium soap settlement for mixtures of the non-ionogeneous PAS with its anione derivatives, the mechanism of synergic action has been offered.

40|$|Based on the literature, {{the review}} shows {{the real value}} of breast milk as the most optimal type of {{postnatal}} feeding of infants. We describe biological mechanisms that are supposed to mediate  the influence of breastfeeding on maturation of  immune response, regulation of intestinal functions, trophic effect on small and large intestinal  mucosa, its microflora and somatic growth of an  infant. In infancy, the protective properties of  breast milk against intestinal infections are largely related to its prebiotic effect. According to the  results of the studies on the structure of the milk  fat <b>mycella</b> envelope, their protein not only participate in bacterial adhesion, but also exert substantial anti-microbial activity due to presence of  antimicrobial components. We discuss the role  of protective nutrients, such as zinc, iron, iodine,  selenium and vitamin A and review the results of studies performed in various countries and aimed at evaluation of an association between the type of feeding of an infant in the 1  year of life and the risk of development of somatic abnormalities. A strong influence of micronutrient deficiencies in the pregnant and breastfeeding woman on delay of in utero development has been shown, as well as its contribution to formation of congenital ab- st normalities of any organ or system, connective  tissue dysplasia, initiation and development of alimentary-related conditions in infants...|$|E
