We investigate the use of support vector machines to improve the classification of InftyReader, a free system for the OCR of mathematical documents. First, we compare the performance of SVM kernels and feature definitions on pairs of letters that InftyReader usually confuses. Second, we describe a successful approach to multi–class classification with SVM, utilizing the ranking of alternatives within InftyReader’s confusion clusters. The inclusion of our technique in InftyReader reduces its <b>misrecognition</b> <b>rate</b> by 41 %...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is one of}} the active bases of sample detection topics. The current study focuses on automatic detection and recognition of hand written Farsi characters. For this purpose; we proposed two different methods based on neural networks and a special post processing approach to improve recognition rate of Farsi uppercase letters. In the first method, we extracted wavelet features from borders of character images and learned a neural network based these patterns. In the second method, we divided input characters into five groups according to the number of their components and used a set of appropriate moment features in each group and classified characters by the Bayesian rule. In a post-processing stage, some structural and statistical features were employed by a decision tree classifier to reduce the <b>misrecognition</b> <b>rate.</b> Our experimental results show suitable recognition rate for both methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of a current voice recognition device (VRD) when used by naive speakers versus practiced speakers, in a speaker independent mode (one in which the VRD device relies on the speech patterns of individuals other than the current speaker). It is conceivable that in future applications of VR technology, it may be costly or impractical to provide practice and training to all users. The findings suggest that first time users of VR equipment, will obtain 96. 85 % recognition accuracy, a level at least as high as that obtained by users who have received training or practiced speaking to the VRD. Neither nonrecognitions (e. g., errors where the system rejects the input and responds, in effect, with I don't understand you, say it again) or misrecognitions (e. g., errors where the system accepts the input but mistakes it for a different input) differed significantly for naive speakers versus practiced speakers. Furthermore, the <b>misrecognition</b> <b>rate</b> for naive speakers was only 1. 11 %. It was concluded that training and practice may not always be necessary in order to obtain optimum performance in the human-VRD system. Without the need for practice, which implies modifying the human's behavior, the human-machine interaction is more natural, the friendliness of the VRD is enhanced, and the cost of the VR system use is reducedsupported and funded by the Naval Electronic Systems Command[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Interactive {{multimedia}} such {{as computer}} simulations and animations received increased attention {{over the years}} as supplementary teaching tools and have now become integral components of most engineering and science curriculums. We believe one way to boost the utility of such simulations and animations is to make them easier to use. In this paper, we describe a pen-based interface for constructing weighted and unweighted graphs which functions as a frontend to a shortest path and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm simulators that we have developed. We compare the usability of this pen-based interface to that of a WIMPbased interface and a hybrid interface that uses a mixture of pen-based and WIMP-based input methods. We report evaluation results on the usability of the three types of interfaces that we have developed. Our results show that a purely penbased approach to graph creation may actually suffer from the relatively higher <b>misrecognition</b> <b>rates</b> of the harder-torecognize symbols and inhibit usability. We conclude that a hybrid approach which combines a soft-keyboard with graph recognition outperforms interfaces that are purely pen-based or WIMP-based. 1 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of Korean's three-way voiceless stop contrast {{depends on the}} combination of a number of acoustic properties including closure duration, f 0, VOT and spectral slope. Production studies indicate that these same properties systematically vary according to a stop's position in the hierarchical prosodic structure of an utterance. This study investigated interactions between prosodic structure and the recognition of tense, lax and aspirated stops by using stimuli that contained stops produced at one position in the prosodic hierarchy cross-spliced into utterances at a different prosodic level. The results of the experiment showed that recognition of tense and aspirated stops remained high regardless of the degree of mismatch between the underlying prosodic position of a segment and the domain into which it was inserted. <b>Misrecognition</b> <b>rates</b> were higher for cross-spliced lax stops, and underlying Utterance and Intonation Phrase initial lax stops spliced into the syllable level were perceived as aspirated by a majority of listeners. These findings are interpreted in terms of Cho & Keating's (2001) study of domain-initial strengthening and the acoustic overlap that is observed between stop manner and prosodic position. These results are taken as preliminary evidence that could support Cho & Keating's (2001) suggestion that prosodically conditioned acoustic differences aid listeners in discerning intended phrasings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} the high accuracy rate of current voice recognitiion systems would be reduced significantly if speakers were required to enter utterances through a mask, as opposed to the boom microphone used with most conventional voice recognition systems. The findings suggest that no significant increase in non-recognitions (e. g., errors where the system rejects the input and says, in effect, (I don't understand you, say it again) is evident while using a mask. Misrecognitions (i. e., errors where the system accepts the input but mistakes it for a different input) do increase significantly under masked conditions. However, the data also indicate that prior experience with speaking into masks or microphones may be a significant moderator of this relationship; subjects that reported having had little or no experience speaking into masks or microphones showed significantly more misrecognition errors than those that reported having some or considerable experience speaking into masks or microphones. Moreover, the data indicate that, when using masks, those subjects that reported having had experience with speaking into masks and microphones (e. g., pilots, communicators) displayed <b>misrecognition</b> error <b>rates</b> still statistically different from but much more comparable to the error rates displayed by subjects under no-mask conditions 9 th Infantry Division Fort Lewis, WA[URL]...|$|R
