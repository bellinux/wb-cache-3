5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side of}} the castle to make it look <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Deeply {{shocked and}} {{upset by the}} accident, Wilbur {{determined}} to make even <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> flight demonstrations; in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, {{and for a time}} they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly.|$|E
5|$|In {{his third}} year as an FSU athlete he won four NCAA Division I titles, {{starting}} with a 200m win indoors. In the 2007 NCAA East Regional final, he won the 100m dash in 10.05seconds. His performance in the 200m was <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> however: he set the all-time collegiate record of 19.69seconds in the 200m, breaking Joe DeLoach's record that had stood since 1988. This made him the sixth fastest 200m runner ever {{and it was the}} seventh fastest run in history at the time.|$|E

5000|$|In this sense, the Soviet deep battle, in {{the words}} of one historian, [...] "was radically {{different}} to the nebulous 'blitzkrieg'" [...] method, although it produced similar if <b>more</b> strategically <b>impressive</b> results.|$|R
50|$|Blind {{or false}} dormer: A dormer {{that is only}} visible externally, i.e. does not provide any extra space or light internally. These are often {{used to make the}} house appear <b>more</b> aesthetically <b>impressive.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since 343 Industries {{developed}} Halo 4 concurrently {{with the}} anniversary edition, {{it decided to}} use Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary to link the original trilogy with the upcoming Reclaimer trilogy by means of in-game collectibles similar to Halo 3s terminals, s audio logs, and Halo: Reachs data pads. While the other games' collectibles were aimed at and enjoyed by serious Halo fiction fans, 343 Industries wanted to make Anniversarys terminals higher-budget, <b>more</b> <b>impressive,</b> and accessible to all players.|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E
50|$|Cutscenes {{became much}} more common {{with the rise of}} CD-ROM as the primary storage medium for video games, as its much greater storage space allowed {{developers}} to use <b>more</b> cinematically <b>impressive</b> media such as FMV and high-quality voice tracks.|$|R
50|$|The playing side of {{the game}} is similar in style to Sensible Soccer and Kick Off; {{offering}} a 2D, top-down perspective on the match. It has been praised for this style, as it values successful gameplay <b>more</b> than <b>impressive</b> graphics.|$|R

5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{were the}} observances {{attendant}} upon the Governor's morning stroll to the post-office. How much <b>more</b> magnificent, <b>impressive,</b> and spectacular, then, {{was the scene}} at public functions when the General would lead forth the silver-haired relic of former greatness, like some rare and fragile waxwork figure, and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens! ...|$|R

50|$|Two <b>more</b> rather <b>impressive</b> seasons {{were spent}} at Blundell Park before Donovan {{confirmed}} the Grimsby supporters' worst fears {{and left to}} join rivals Barnsley. His time at Oakwell was mainly blighted by injury problems,and he experienced relegation with the club, {{and at the end}} of the 2002/2003 season he was released by The Tykes. During his spell at Barnsley he scored once against Walsall in December 2001.|$|R

5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. <b>More</b> <b>impressive</b> are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit <b>more</b> <b>impressive,</b> and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} in The Age Neil Jillet noted {{that with this}} novel [...] "George Turner ends his Treelake (Wangraratta ?) trilogy, one of the <b>more</b> quietly <b>impressive</b> {{achievements}} of Australian postwar literature." [...] He did, however, have some reservations: [...] "if the flesh of this novel is rather weak, its bones are in first-class order. Mr. Turner knows how Australians think and act, {{even though he has}} forgotten how they speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|If it be solemn {{to behold}} from this new City of the Dead, with its dark smoke {{hanging in the}} clear sky, how much <b>more</b> awful and <b>impressive</b> is it, viewed from the ghostly ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii! ...|$|R
50|$|The Passage {{graves of}} Orkney, Ireland's Boyne Valley, and north Wales are even <b>more</b> complex and <b>impressive,</b> with cross-shaped {{arrangements}} of chambers and passages. The workmanship {{on the stone}} blocks at Maeshowe for example is unknown elsewhere in northwest Europe at the time.|$|R

5|$|Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque style {{relatively}} late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much {{of the best}} Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact {{of time and the}} Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration {{can be seen in the}} illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Yates {{cared about}} much <b>more</b> than an <b>impressive</b> building. She {{expanded}} library {{services for the}} disabled, ethnic groups, and prisoners. She brought the library into the Fulton County jail, making the jail the first penal institution {{in the country with}} a public library branch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{training}} {{exercises are}} {{split into two}} groups: the [...] "Core Training" [...] and the [...] "Sports Training." [...] The Core Training games were described as the type of tests seen at an optometrist's office. [...] The [...] "Sports Training" [...] involved strengthening vision through sports games such as table tennis, basketball, and baseball. For instance, in baseball, players tap the screen when the baseball enters the strike zone. Reviewers found the Sports Training games to be <b>more</b> visually <b>impressive</b> than the Core Training games.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{have almost}} {{unanimously}} agreed with James' disowning of Watch and Ward {{as his first}} novel {{in favor of the}} infinitely <b>more</b> substantial and <b>impressive</b> Roderick Hudson. While Nora gets kudos as a pleasant enough ingénue, the other characters are forgettable and the plot is too often silly.|$|R

5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> {{when one considers that}} he had been suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} graphics; GamePro called Seasons [...] "bright and colorful" [...] with [...] "surprisingly {{expressive}} and well-designed" [...] animations, and Gaming Target said Ages is [...] "beautiful and creative", with [...] "meticulous attention to detail". Gaming Age called both games [...] "the pinnacle of good graphics on the Game Boy Color system". Although the two share graphics {{to a large}} extent, Seasons is distinguished by swapping the color palette to reflect the current season. IGN felt that the expressive colors used for the changing seasons made Seasons the <b>more</b> graphically <b>impressive</b> of the two.|$|R
40|$|The Woman Warrior is {{the first}} book of Maxine Hong Kingston. In this book, there are {{different}} narrators in telling the stories. As a deviance, in the fourth chapter, At the Western Palace, the third person narration presents a <b>more</b> vivid and <b>impressive</b> story. This deviance enhances the tragic end of the protagonists...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a zwischenzug is often listed as a tactic, but might {{properly}} be called a counter-tactic instead. The effect of a zwischenzug {{is to change the}} status quo before a tactic can come to fruition. The near ubiquity of the zwischenzug makes long combinations all the <b>more</b> rare and <b>impressive.</b>|$|R
