25|$|In his monograph, The Origins Of The Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939– March 1942, Christopher Browning {{argues that}} Nazi {{policy toward the}} Jews was radicalized twice: in September 1939, when the {{invasion}} of Poland implied policies of <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion</b> and massive loss of Jewish lives; and in spring 1941, when preparation for Operation Barbarossa involved the planning of mass execution, <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion,</b> and starvation – to dwarf {{what had happened in}} Jewish Poland.|$|E

25|$|There were <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> {{from the}} party, with Stalin {{commanding}} foreign communist parties to also purge anti-Stalinist elements. During the 1930s and 1940s, NKVD groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad; in August 1940, Trotsky {{was assassinated in}} Mexico, eliminating the last of Stalin's opponents among the former Party leadership.|$|R

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{ethnic cleansing}} also included Russians, Armenians, Greeks, moderate Abkhaz and other minor ethnic groups living in Abkhazia. More than 20,000 houses owned by ethnic Georgians were destroyed. Hundreds of Schools, kindergartens, churches, hospitals, historical monuments were pillaged and destroyed.

25|$|In 1864 {{until the}} early 20th century, another <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion</b> took place of Caucasian Muslims {{as a result of}} the Russian victory in the Caucasian War.

5000|$|Kidron's conclusion: [...] "In brief, the two descriptions, {{particularly}} when taken together, proved beyond any shadow of {{doubt that there}} were high-level directives for <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> of the Arab population, and that the decision-makers, evidently aware of the discreditable and unlawful nature of such a policy, were careful to leave no incriminating evidence about their personal and political responsibility." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 1947 Staudinger was {{amongst the}} signatories of a {{declaration}} by former Social Democratic Reichstag members that was printed in Time {{and in the}} Neue Volkszeitung, the leading German-language newspaper in the United States.

25|$|In 1941 Serov was {{promoted}} to become Deputy Commissar of the NKVD as a whole, serving under Beria {{as one of his}} primary lieutenants; in this function, Serov was responsible for the deportation of a variety of Caucasian peoples. He issued the so-called Serov Instructions, which detailed procedures for mass deportations from the Baltic States (For some time confused with the NKVD Order No. 001223 by historians.). He also coordinated the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion</b> of Crimean Tatars from the Crimean ASSR at the end of World War II.|$|E

5000|$|The Shanghai {{massacre}} of 1927 and the Night of the Long Knives of 1934, {{in which the}} leader of a political party turned against and killed a particular section or group within the party, are commonly called [...] "purges" [...] while <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> on grounds of racism and xenophobia, such as that of the Crimean Tatars and the Japanese-American internment are not.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{they were}} after 1945 the target of harsh {{reprisals}} and especially <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> from countries such as Hungary and Yugoslavia where many of these families had lived for centuries. The ones in Romania, such as Jäger, were spared wholesale expulsion; nevertheless, they faced considerable harassment and many were dispersed within Romania, or left its territory at their own initiative (see also the Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II).|$|R
5000|$|While in Poznań, Damzog was {{actively}} involved in the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> of Poles from Reichsgau Wartheland to General Government, including after the 1941 German attack across the Soviet zone of occupation. He personally selected staff for the killing centre in Chełmno extermination camp and supervised its daily operation.

2500|$|Pierce {{believed}} in a hierarchical society governed {{by what he}} saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy.

5000|$|Thousands of {{inhabitants}} of the East German border region were expelled en masse in 1952 in an action, codenamed Operation Vermin (Aktion Ungeziefer), intended to rid the border villages of so-called [...] "unreliable elements". In 1961, rumours of {{a new wave of}} <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> began circulating in Böseckendorf. Many inhabitants, particularly farmers who had resisted the forced collectivization policies of the GDR regime, feared that they were on Stasi blacklists of those slated for expulsion.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} October 1939, the Germans {{introduced}} {{the death penalty for}} active disobedience to the German occupation. Plans for <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> and the system of slave labour camps for up to 20 million Poles were made. Himmler thought of moving all Poles to Siberia. In May 1940 he wrote a memorandum; in it, he promised to eventually deport all Poles to the east. Most of them were intended to die during the cultivation of the swamps.|$|R
5000|$|Winston Churchill was {{not present}} {{at the end of}} the Conference, since the results of the British {{elections}} had made it clear that he had been defeated. Churchill later claimed that he would never have agreed to the Oder-Western Neisse line, and in his famous Iron Curtain speech declared that"The Russian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make enormous and wrongful inroads upon Germany, and <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> of millions of Germans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of are now taking place." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century there was a single Ottoman-Sephardic tradition (no doubt with local variations) covering Turkey, Syria, Palestine and Egypt. [...] Today the Jerusalem-Sephardic, Syrian, Egyptian and Baghdadi melodies recognisably belong to a single family. [...] For example, in these traditions the Torah reading is always or almost always in Maqam Sigah. [...] There are some variations, among individual readers as well as among communities: for example the Egyptian melody is related to the more elaborate and cantorial form of the Syrian melody and was transitioning toward Maqam Huzzam before the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion</b> in 1950. [...] The Karaite tradition, being based on the Egyptian, also forms part of this group.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{reaction}} to the expulsion of colonists, Czechoslovakia started to take countermeasures and declared that further expelled civilians would be settled on land belonging to members of the Hungarian minority and Hungarian state citizens (the Hungarian aristocracy owned 50,000 ha of agricultural land and 14,000 ha of woods in Slovakia). [...] Hungary promised that it would stop mass expulsions and was open to negotiations about property issues. Changes in Hungarian policy were driven by several factors. The new Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, István Csáky, advocated the opinion that Hungarian steps did not have the expected effects, increased anti-Hungarian moods, caused disillusionment of the last Hungarophiles and pushed the Slovak government into cooperation with the central Czechoslovak government. The Hungarian government continued with expulsion, but claimed that it was not <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion,</b> that Slovaks and Czechs left the territory voluntarily and that Hungary had not prevented them from doing so.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{editorial}} {{at the time}} The Economist, a British weekly newspaper, criticised the hypocrisy of both Britain and France for supporting the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations over its unprovoked attack against Finland in 1939 and for six years later cooperating with the USSR as a respected equal at Nuremberg. It also criticised the allies for their own double-standard at the Nuremberg Trials: [...] "nor should the Western world console itself that the Russians alone stand condemned at the bar of the Allies' own justice.... Among crimes against humanity stands the offence of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations. Can the Americans who dropped the atom bomb and the British who destroyed the cities of western Germany plead 'not guilty' on this count? Crimes against humanity also include the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsion</b> of populations. Can the Anglo-Saxon leaders who at Potsdam condoned the expulsion of millions of Germans from their homes hold themselves completely innocent?... The nations sitting in judgement have so clearly proclaimed themselves exempt from the law which they have administered." ...|$|E
25|$|In October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were {{expelled}} from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev {{were expelled}} from the Communist Party on 12 November.

Hillgruber had not supported Nolte, but the controversy over Zweierlei Untergang became linked with Nolte's views when Habermas and Wehler characterized both men as conservatives trying to minimize Nazi crimes.|$|R

5000|$|In 1857, Dmitry Milyutin first {{published}} {{the idea of}} <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> of Circassian natives. Miliutin argued that the goal was not to simply move them so that their land could be settled by productive farmers, but rather that [...] "eliminating the Circassians was to be {{an end in itself}} - to cleanse the land of hostile elements". Tsar Alexander II endorsed the plans, and Milyutin later would become the minister of war in 1861, and from the early 1860s expulsions began occurring in the Caucasus (first in the Northeast and then in the Northwest).|$|R
50|$|Tilman Zülch {{feels that}} it is an {{obligation}} to campaign for religiously and ethnically persecuted people, especially for Germany and Austria given the crimes of Nazi Germany. He feels that the way for Germans to deal with the past is not to stay silent in face of other crimes such as those of the Stalin era, the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> of Germans after 1945, or the genocides of today. For example, in the early 1990s he was fined for breaking into a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm warehouse in Munich to secure evidence of the company's covertly supplying the Iraqi air force; he repeatedly protested Russia's military actions in Chechnya, comparing the bombing of Grozny to Dresden in 1945; in 2005 in advance of the official visit of German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg, East Prussia) to celebrate the city's 750th anniversary, he demanded in an open letter that Schröder note the <b>mass</b> <b>expulsions</b> and deaths of Germans there and elsewhere in the former eastern territories of Germany under Stalin; he protested the 2008 Summer Olympics in China on behalf of Tibet, comparing it to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin under the Nazis; and he has been credited as one of those most responsible for the Sinti and Roma being recognized as a minority people in Germany. He is also the editor of the journal bedrohte völker (previously pogrom).|$|R
