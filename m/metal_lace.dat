50|$|Lace {{made using}} gold wire has been {{produced}} since antiquity, {{with examples of}} gold netting found in Egyptian and Assyrian tombs from 1500-1000 BCE. It was mainly produced as an embellishment for religious vestments and high status garments. <b>Metal</b> <b>lace,</b> including gold and silver point de Venise, was produced in Italy until the 15th century, when high taxation and sumptuary laws led to textile threads such as linen replacing the use of metal. To avoid these costs, the production of <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> moved to France, where a high demand by royalty and the French aristocracy led to Arras, Aurillac and other locations becoming renowned for gold lace production. From the 15th century on, most <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> {{was a combination of}} metal and textile threads, rather than made of pure metal.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary gold lace {{usually has}} a high silver percentage, which can {{be as high as}} 90%, with the actual gold content as low as 3%. Much modern gold (and other <b>metal)</b> <b>lace</b> is now {{manufactured}} in India. Modern Indian [...] "pure gold lace" [...] is technically made from silver that has been electroplated with gold.|$|E

50|$|Dō-maru were {{constructed}} from small scales of leather or <b>metal</b> <b>laced</b> into plates with cord and lacquered. Then each plate was laced {{together to form}} the armor. Due to the weight of iron, armour makers limited its use to the most vital parts of the armor and used leather for the remainder.|$|R

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>lace</b> {{describes}} {{a type of}} lace made from metal or metallic threads, such as gold, silver, or copper. The designs can be worked on a textile ground, or the lace can completely be made from metallic threads. It is mainly used as an embellishment for military uniforms, fashionable, ceremonial and theatrical dress, and ecclesiastical textiles.|$|E
50|$|Air {{and water}} are the {{structural}} and visual {{components of the}} eighteen elaborate silhouettes of the collection and have influenced the development of both the textiles and garment construction, which is reflected in their volumes, rippling patterning and translucent layering. Biomorphic structures include a feathery-light <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> of geodesic floral patterns in collaboration with Philip Beesley, which float around the body like a silver cloud. Echo waves of mylar bonded cotton ripple across the skin mapping {{the surface of the}} body and painting its contours. The shoes are made from a soft suede with a parametric welded metal heel, creating a delicate molecular lattice around the foot.|$|E
50|$|Jolimeau was an {{apprentice}} under Seresier Louis-Juste after high school, {{and joined the}} Centre d’Art, Haiti, in 1972 where he met his mentor Murat Brierre. He stands out with Gabriel Bien-Aimé {{as one of the}} most gifted metal sculptors (traditional sculptural art of carved metal, particularly from steel drums, inaugurated in Haiti by Georges Liautaud) of his generation. Jolimeau's stylization and fantastic complexity, grounded in voodoo inspiration, tends to produce works giving the impression of a <b>metal</b> <b>lace.</b> In 2009, Jolimeau along with Micah Ramil Remy and Toyin Folorunso were artists selected by Bill Clinton to create commemorative works for the Clinton Global Citizen Awards as part of the Clinton Global Initiative. At the end of 2010, following the Haiti earthquake and in cooperation with the Clinton Global Initiative, Macy's agreed to sell Croix-des-Bouquetes artisan created works from Jolimeau's shop in their stores throughout the United States. His artwork has been exhibited internationally since 1979. Jolimeau has participated in the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market annually since 2005.|$|E

40|$|The metal laces {{made using}} the bobbin lace {{techniques}} on Estonian national costumes have received unreasonably modest attention. Unlike {{other types of}} lace that have been studied in the 20 th and 21 st centuries, there is no information {{regarding the use of}} metal laces in Estonia. In order to better understand the background of national costumes decorated with metal laces, one needs to be familiar with the political, economic and educational life of the time. The research questions set in this article concern the spread of <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> used on Estonian national costumes, the technology used and the contemporary materials for making metal bobbin lace. I discuss the spread of laces and the purpose of use thereof; also, I provide an overview of the technological aspects that the makers of national costumes can rely on to create authentic national costumes. The items decorated with metal bobbin lace preserved in the Estonian National Museum date back to a period from 1714 (Kadrina pot-shaped cap ERM 16362) to around 1900. Hence our ancestors held the beauty of <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> in high esteem and used it to decorate their clothing for almost 200 years. During this period, present-day Estonia was divided in two – Estonia and Livonia – and the country had been under Russian rule since 1710. Metal bobbin lace is widespread primarily in northern and western Estonia and on the islands. The use of bobbin lace decreased after 1860 when crochet lace pushed it into the background, as the former required more time and more resources. This article examines the period from the early 18 th century to the late 19 th century. Based on the collections of the Estonian National Museum, I created a database of 223 items decorated with metal bobbin lace. Metal bobbin lace was used to decorate midriff blouses, head covers and aprons – in short, the technique was used to decorate items which {{play a central role in}} clothing. Items of clothing decorated with metal bobbin lace were considered fancy. The use of linen lace in Estonia has been documented, but there is no data on the making of <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> locally. In the course of my research, I was not able to find any reference to metal bobbin lace being made locally. The few explanations that can be found in the object legends in the museum refer to <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> as a purchased good. The need of the peasantry for beautiful items should be highly appreciated and the desire to decorate one’s clothes with remarkable details even more so – using expensive purchased goods like gold or silver lace. Trade connections between Tallinn and Russia were tight; therefore, we can claim for certain that goods produced in Russia, including <b>metal</b> <b>lace,</b> could have found their way into sales outlets in Tallinn. We find a series of references to gold and silver laces in the trilogy of source publications of the property lists of German merchants in Tallinn in the 18 th century. Unfortunately, most of the laces do not include references to their origins, and the information given is limited to the amount and material. Thanks to trade connections with foreign countries, even the peasantry had the possibility to purchase lace. In addition to town stores, they were also able to buy lace at fairs or from peddlers. As metal laces with slight variations in patterns were produced from the 17 th- 19 th centuries in several European lace centres, it is difficult to name the specific place from which the laces found in Estonia might originate. It is probable that the metal laces found here were imported from Europe. Many of the laces are similar. Wide laces consist of a wavy band whose waves are separated with a fan motif. Many of the laces have small teeth joined by a net. The edges of the lace can be wavy or straight, but with one exception they are all attached to textile, and not used as lace between the textile or on the end of the textile. In the article, I give an overview of different materials that have been used to make historic <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> and which are accessible to contemporary masters. The availability of suitable material enabled me to make new <b>metal</b> <b>lace</b> based on the examples. However, I do not dare to claim that the material used was authentic. In the future, the chemical composition and the origins of metal laces used on national costumes deserve further research...|$|E
50|$|Texture in {{painting}} is {{the look and}} feel of the canvas. It is based on the paint, and its application, or the addition of materials such as ribbon, <b>metal,</b> wood, <b>lace,</b> leather and sand. The concept of 'painterliness' also has bearing on texture. The texture stimulates two different senses; sight and touch. There are four types of texture in art: actual texture, simulated texture, abstract texture, and invented texture.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to model the {{behavior}} of a mixture of 30 % fly ash, 60 % black cotton soil, 30 % heavy <b>metal</b> <b>laced</b> industrial sludge, and 15 % cement for sorption of chromium and copper at different pH values. It was found that the mixture of 30 % fly ash, 60 % soil, 30 % sludge, and 15 % cement was the ideal combination found from extensive leaching experiments for heavy metals such as Cr+ 6 and Cu+ 6. Owing to practical difficulties of carrying out leaching tests over a wide range of pH values, visual minteq was used to simulate these conditions. It is found that the model predicts the retention behavior accurately and was further confirmed with the output of previous experimental work. A series of visual minteq simulations revealed that surface complexation and reduction play an important role in the sorption process. It was concluded that the hazardous sludge <b>laced</b> with heavy <b>metals</b> can be stabilized. The study would benefit the design engineers in understanding and in finding alternate means for treating industrial sludge waste...|$|R

[...] Gregory Heaney of AllMusic wrote [...] "Although the schtick can wear a bit thin at times, musically Triple Brutal is a solid album ready-made for the mosh pit, and those looking to get some cathartic metal that doesn't take itself too seriously, or maybe just a little more of The Governator, into their lives won't be disappointed." [...] D.X. Ferris of MetalSucks wrote [...] "Unlike its predecessors, Triple Brutal does not sound like a funny guy and his jovial friends enjoying themselves. Compared to Double Brutal, B3 is grittier, but in a way that seems at odds with the band’s core concept. Regardless of your position on Lambesis, Triple Brutal isn’t going to make you laugh. And if an album full of Schwarzenegger impressions and skits isn’t fun, what’s the point?" [...] John Jackson of The Metal Resource reported [...] "Overall, this is probably the best of the ADM albums from an overall song quality standpoint. Nothing will ever top hearing “Get to the Choppa” for the first time, but from start to finish, Triple Brutal is filled with fast, driving metal that can help anyone who is “looking {{a little bit like a}} noodle” get some “gymspiration” to get in “One More Rep”." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Prometheus, Curt Calhoun, {{debuted in}} Blue Beetle #3 (Aug. 1986), followed by appearances in issues #4 (Sept. 1986); #6 (Nov. 1986); #8-9 (Jan.-Feb. 1987) and #11-13 (April-June 1987). The character returned in New Teen Titans #34 (Aug. 1987), and was apparently referenced as being deceased in JSA #28 (Nov. 2001). Curt Calhoun is a small-time criminal working for supervillain Doctor Alchemy and is hired {{to steal a}} quantity of the metal promethium from KORD Inc., an organization owned by Ted Kord (secretly the Blue Beetle). Although successful, both Calhoun and Dr. Alchemy are captured by Kord's alter ego Blue Beetle. On release from prison, Calhoun aids the Blue Beetle against the villain the Calculator and is offered a position as a foreman at KORD Inc. by Kord. While saving Kord from an industrial accident, Calhoun is covered with <b>metals</b> <b>laced</b> with promethium. En route to the hospital, Calhoun's ambulance is attacked by members of the supervillain team Hybrid. The leader Mento transformed the metal covering Calhoun into a permanent metallic shell. Assuming the alias [...] "Prometheus", the reluctant Calhoun fights alongside Hybrid in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the New Teen Titans. Although Mento eventually directs Hybrid against the Titans once again, they rebel and Mento is apparently cured of his insanity by Titans member Raven. Calhoun is never seen again, until superhero team the JSA learn that Hybrid died in the gladiatorial games staged by villainess Roulette. The original Prometheus possesses a metal epidermis, which confers superior strength and durability. Calhoun is also capable of raising the temperature of his armored form to several hundred degrees Celsius.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Qin dynasty in 207 BC came the rise of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. During the Han dynasty, new style of armour such as scale corselet made of leather and/or iron were adopted. During this time period, the primary metal used in armour was iron, and {{occasionally}} steel. Early Han soldiers would have used armour and weapons produced during the Qin era. The Han army had armour standardized to meet the need. Armour used by the Han included coats of plates; 两当铠 (liang-tang, or [...] "double-faced" [...] armour); and lamellar cuirases made of metal or leather that was suspended over the shoulders by cords. This armour was used by both the infantry and the cavalry. A much heavier and more expensive version, consisting of <b>metal</b> plates <b>laced</b> together, was worn by officers.|$|R

40|$|Vivianite is a bluish mineral {{sometimes}} {{encountered in}} archaeological deposits. It is notable for its tendency to change color from white or grayish to blue on exposure to air. Vivianite requires specific conditions for its formation-sources of iron, phosphate, and water, {{as well as}} low levels of oxygen and sulfide. Microbial activity is also thought to {{play a part in}} vivianite formation. The majority of archaeological texts do not discuss vivianite to any great degree, preventing a more detailed interpretation of site conditions and features. Vivianite was found in 25 exhumed burials from the North Brisbane Burial Ground, Queensland, Australia. Research indicated that bone or tissue samples for DNA analysis are best taken from areas distant from vivianite encrustations and that presence of vivianite has implications for artifact conservation. Vivianite at the North Brisbane Burial Grounds helped protect some skeletal and dental elements, preserved the impressions of <b>metal</b> coffin <b>lacing,</b> and also corroborated the oral history of temporary waterlogging and acted as a measure of pollution levels across the site.

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about Megatech as a company. They were founded prior to 1992. The first three games {{published}} were anime themed adult games. Their first release Cobra Mission: Panic in Cobra City was self-rated NR-18 (a rating indicating the presence of nudity and sexual content), the second two were NR-13 with the option of purchasing an upgrade to NR-18, and the last was self-rated as acceptable for all ages. All were made for MS-DOS. Upgrades were purchased separately and {{came in the form of}} 3.5 floppy disks that were installed separately. The games had some voice acting starting with Cobra Mission:Panic in Cobra City which was limited to moans from the female characters in the game. <b>Metal</b> & <b>Lace</b> had a wider range of voice acting, however, again it was limited to single sentences said by the female characters. Knights of Xentar used CD-ROM technology to have a wide array of voice acting including complete voices during all cut scenes by both male and female characters.|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>metal</b> eyelets, tight <b>lacing</b> became possible. The {{position}} of the eyelets changed. They were situated across from one another at the back. The front was fastened with a metal busk in front. Corsets were mostly white. The corsets of the 1850s–1860s were shorter than the corsets of the 19th century through 1840s. This was because {{of a change in}} the silhouette of women's fashion. The 1850s and 1860s emphasized the hoopskirt. After the 1860s, when the hoop fell out of style, the corset became longer to mold the abdomen, exposed by the new lines of the princess or cuirass style.|$|R
