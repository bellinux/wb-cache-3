5000|$|... “A Koroga {{involves}} outdoor cooking, {{usually a}} chicken or meat curry, {{in an industrial}} sized aluminium sic pot on a charcoal fire (jiko), almost always by a man. Crusty white bread and a mixed raw salad usually accompanied the Koroga curries of my childhood. On my first birthday party in 1975 <b>my</b> <b>Dad</b> <b>did</b> a Koroga for 200 people. And my mum made about 14 other dishes. I wish I had a scanner so I could share the photos with you, although they are embedded in an album and my mum would freak if I dislodged them, so you’ll just have to conjure a mental image of women in impeccable 70s fashion (a lot of bouffants, bell-bottoms and elegant saris) {{and a lot of}} men sitting around a simmering cauldron of chicken masala. I think my 1st birthday was just a convenient excuse. The Koroga tradition is alive and kicking with dedicated Koroga clubs and facilities all over Kenya. I went to a Karoga the other day and not much has changed - over-sized pot, rustic jiko, all fresh ingredients, beer, scotch, madafu (coconut water), bread, salad and a lot of anticipation for the main course. Though now there are a few more starters (they were called ‘bitings’ in my childhood days), naans, more vegetarian options, and rather fancy desserts (we usually got fruit salad or ice cream - a trifle if we were lucky). Many cultures have a tradition of outdoor cooking in various guises, be it a barbecue,cookout, or Koroga. It’s about getting together in the fresh air and great outdoors and giving the men a chance to cook in the ‘manliest’ way possible - not for them the fancy Le Creuset casseroles and the small cooking ranges! Yes, I know things are changing now!” ...|$|E

40|$|Thank you to Queen Mary College and {{especially}} Jonathan Haskel {{for inviting me}} to give this lecture. It’s strange to give a lecture {{in the name of}} your dad – but also an honour. I was never sure when I was young what exactly <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>did.</b> When I was young he taught at LSE and I was convinced he was at the London School of eco-Comics – which sounded pretty good to me. But when I visited the office I found a distinct lack of the Beano, or Scorcher and Score. And my main early memories of QMC I’m afraid are not of breakthrough economics but that it seemed a long way off from south west London where we lived. We used to disagree a fair bit on economics – as well as politics. In my very youthful days I of course saw his Keynesian bias as a sell out to capitalism and was more interested in the more socialist policies being advocated by the Conference of Socialist Economics and its stars, like another alumnus of this place, David, now – naturally- Lord, Currie. Later, while doing my Masters at Queens ’ University in Canada under people like Doug Purvis and working as teaching assistant for John Driffill, another ex QMC professor, I became pretty enamoured by the lure and elegance of the new classical macro economics.

5000|$|Caswell {{came under}} fire from Michigan Public Radio [...] for a 2011 {{proposal}} to issue the Michigan state $80 clothing allowance for children that receive state welfare assistance [...] as an $80 gift card redeemable at secondhand clothing stores, such as Goodwill and Salvation Army, rather than just adding another $80 credit to the Bridge Card account that would be untraceable in how it was actually spent. The Michigan Radio article and a subsequent article in the Michigan Messenger incorrectly stated that this proposal would affect the clothing allowance for foster children; however, the foster care clothing allowance is a different program [...] and was never a part of Caswell's proposal. [...] Under the current system, DHS issues each year, on average, an additional $80 to a child’s parents’ Bridge Card for the clothing allowance.
