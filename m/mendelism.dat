25|$|E. B. Ford was an {{experimental}} naturalist {{who wanted to}} test natural selection in nature, virtually inventing the field of ecological genetics. His work on natural selection in wild populations of butterflies and moths {{was the first to}} show that predictions made by R. A. Fisher were correct. In 1940, {{he was the first to}} describe and define genetic polymorphism, and to predict that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease. His 1949 book <b>Mendelism</b> and Evolution, helped to persuade Dobzhansky to change the emphasis in the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began his}} career in {{genetics}} as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal theory of inheritance, demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that <b>Mendelism</b> supported Darwinism.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive work in {{biometry}} {{seemed to}} indicate that continuous natural variation had distinct limits and did not represent heritable changes. Embryological development posed an additional problem in Morgan's view, as selection could not act on the early, incomplete stages of highly complex organs such as the eye. The common solution of the Lamarckian mechanism of inheritance of acquired characters, which featured prominently in Darwin's theory, was increasingly rejected by biologists. According to Morgan's biographer Garland Allen, he was also hindered by his views on taxonomy: he thought that species were entirely artificial creations that distorted the continuously variable range of real forms, while he held a [...] "typological" [...] view of larger taxa and could see no way that one such group could transform into another. But while Morgan was skeptical of natural selection for many years, his theories of heredity and variation were radically transformed through his conversion to <b>Mendelism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{view is that}} Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a {{synthesis}} of <b>Mendelism</b> and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and {{the probability that a}} new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900. The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that [...] "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected". Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's confrontational approach, but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decades before}} the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been {{described}} as the eclipse of Darwinism. Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were neo-Lamarckism (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), orthogenesis ("straight-line" [...] evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of <b>Mendelism</b> and Hugo De Vries' mutation theory. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term Darwinism had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of August Weismann who went further than Darwin by rejecting inheritance of acquired characters and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called neo-Darwinism. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the modern evolutionary synthesis, which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.|$|E

50|$|Mendelian inheritance, or <b>Mendelism,</b> was {{supported}} by the Nazis, as well as by mainstream eugenicists of the time. The Mendelian theory of inheritance declared that genetic traits and attributes were passed from one generation to another.

Gordon Stein wrote that Svante Arrhenius was an atheist. In his last years he wrote both textbooks and popular books, trying to emphasize the need for further work on the topics he discussed. In September 1927 he came down with an attack of acute intestinal catarrh and died on 2 October. He was buried in Uppsala.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{an early}} {{promoter}} and lifelong supporter of Mendelian genetics {{and a friend}} of Bateson's, he appears to have parted ways with his mentor on some points. In his 1932 book on The Mechanism of Creative Evolution Hurst adopted the chromosome theory of inheritance whole-heartedly referring copiously to Thomas Hunt Morgan's Drosophila work, and he was also clearly a staunch Darwinist. He believed that natural selection and Mendelian genetics were compatible, and referred to the theoretical work of Sewall Wright, R.A. Fisher, and J.B.S. Haldane, which proved that quantitative traits and natural selection were compatible with <b>Mendelism.</b> As he argued in Creative Evolution (1932), p. xix: ...|$|E
50|$|By 1900, {{research}} {{aimed at}} finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than blending inheritance led to independent duplication {{of his work}} by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns, and the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries {{did not understand the}} results he had found until after reading Mendel. Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendel's laws. Though de Vries later lost interest in <b>Mendelism,</b> other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel's work within a two-month span in the Spring of 1900.|$|E
50|$|Mendel's {{experiments}} on cultivated varieties of plants {{were published in}} 1865, but attracted little notice until thirty-five years later, sixteen {{years after his death}} (see <b>Mendelism).</b> Mendel tried {{to gain a better understanding}} of heredity. His main experiments were with varieties of the edible pea. He chose a variety with one marked structural feature and crossed it with another variety in which that feature was absent. For example, he hybridized a tall variety, with a dwarf variety, a yellow-seeded variety with a green-seeded variety, and a smooth-seeded variety with a wrinkle-seeded variety. In each experiment, he concentrated on one character; after obtaining a first hybrid generation, he allowed the hybrids to self-fertilize, and recorded the number of individuals in the first, second, third, and fourth generations in which the chosen character appeared.|$|E
50|$|The {{views of}} Hugo de Vries and others about the {{importance}} of saltatory variation, the soundness of which was still not generally accepted in 1910, may be gathered from the article <b>Mendelism.</b> A due appreciation of the far-reaching results of correlated variation must, it appeared, give a new and distinct explanation of large mutations, discontinuous variation, and saltatory evolution. The analysis of the specific variations of organic form to determine the nature and limitation of a single character, and whether two variations of a structural unit can blend when one is transmitted by the male parent and the other by the female, were yet to be determined. It was not clear whether absolute blending was possible, or whether all apparent blending was only a more-or-less minutely subdivided mosaic of non-combinable characters of the parents.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1900 and 1910 Bateson {{directed}} a rather informal [...] "school" [...] of genetics at Cambridge. His group consisted mostly of women associated with Newnham College, Cambridge, and included both his wife Beatrice, {{and her sister}} Florence Durham. They provided assistance for his research program {{at a time when}} <b>Mendelism</b> was not yet recognised as a legitimate field of study. The women, such as Muriel Wheldale (later Onslow), carried out a series of breeding experiments in various plant and animal species between 1902 and 1910. The results both supported and extended Mendel's laws of heredity. Hilda Blanche Killby, who had finished her studies with the Newnham College Mendelians in 1901, aided Bateson replicate Mendel's crosses in peas. She conducted independent breeding experiments in rabbits and bantam fowl, as well.|$|E
5000|$|Mendelian {{genetics}} were rediscovered in 1900. However, {{it remained}} somewhat controversial {{for several years}} as it was not then known how it could cause continuous characteristics. Udny Yule (1902) argued against <b>Mendelism</b> because he thought that dominant alleles would increase in the population. The American William E. Castle (1903) showed that without selection, the genotype frequencies would remain stable. Karl Pearson (1903) found one equilibrium position with values of p = q = 0.5. Reginald Punnett, unable to counter Yule's point, introduced the problem to G. H. Hardy, a British mathematician, with whom he played cricket. Hardy was a pure mathematician and held applied mathematics in some contempt; his view of biologists' use of mathematics comes across in his 1908 paper where he describes this as [...] "very simple": ...|$|E
50|$|William Bateson was {{credited}} as the scientist who first brought Mendel’s theories to the English speaking world, and the coiner {{of the term}} 'genetics'. Given the nickname 'Bateson's Bulldog', Hurst has been described along with Bateson {{as one of the}} two leaders of <b>Mendelism</b> in England {{at the turn of the}} 20th Century. Bateson and Hurst collaborated in the battle against the biometricians Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, with Hurst generating much data from experimental crosses of different plant varieties and animal color variants, including chickens, horses, and man. Together they practically proved that Mendelian genetics could be extended to many different systems. Hurst was much younger than Bateson, but had a fiery passion for genetics, great skill in debate, and an approachableness lacking in some of his older peers which meant he was well respected within the scientific and lay community.|$|E

5000|$|Regardless, the [...] "re-discovery" [...] made <b>Mendelism</b> an {{important}} but controversial theory. Its most vigorous promoter in Europe was William Bateson, {{who coined the}} terms [...] "genetics" [...] and [...] "allele" [...] to describe many of its tenets. The model of heredity was highly contested by other biologists because it implied that heredity was discontinuous, {{in opposition to the}} apparently continuous variation observable for many traits. Many biologists also dismissed the theory because they were not sure it would apply to all species. However, later work by biologists and statisticians such as Ronald Fisher showed that if multiple Mendelian factors were involved in the expression of an individual trait, they could produce the diverse results observed, and thus showed that Mendelian genetics is compatible with natural selection. Thomas Hunt Morgan and his assistants later integrated Mendel's theoretical model with the chromosome theory of inheritance, in which the chromosomes of cells were thought to hold the actual hereditary material, and created what is now known as classical genetics, a highly successful foundation which eventually cemented Mendel's place in history.|$|E

But on the other side, plant breeders and agricultural researchers, despite an interest in <b>Mendelism,</b> never came to see it as the breeders' panacea, and regarded it instead as of only limited value for plant breeding. I account for this judgment in showing that the plant breeders and <b>Mendelism</b> designed two contrasting kinds of experimental systems and inhabited distinct experimental cultures. While Mendelian geneticists designed experimental systems that allowed the production of definite ratios of different forms that varied in relation to a few characters, plant breeders' experimental systems produced a wide range of variation, featuring combinations between hundreds of traits. Rather than breaking this multiple variation down into simple elements, breeders designed and monitored a genetic lottery. The gene was a unit in a Mendelian experimental culture, an “epistemic thing” as H. -J. Rheinberger put it, that could be grasped by means of statistical regularities, but it remained of secondary importance for French plant breeders, for whom the strain or the variety –not the gene– was the fundamental unit of analysis and manipulation...|$|E

Three dimensions of description must be taken into account: scholarly diffusion; transmission of the new science through teaching and textbooks; effective research. These three axes of description do not provide the same picture: Mendelian research was widely reported among specialists; no significant teaching of <b>Mendelism</b> took place in the years 1900 - 1930; by 1930 only one biologist, Lucien Cuénot, had done significant genetic research, but he abandoned his Mendelian research in 1914. The resistance to <b>Mendelism</b> can be attributed to four categories of factors, none of which is sufficient. The first category includes a series of intellectual factors: a massively positivist conception of science, an approach to heredity that privileged a “physiological ” theory, and a poor development of cytology. The second set of factors stems from the failure of French academic biologists to establish strong interaction with plant and animal breeding. The third factor is the relatively weak influence of the eugenic ideology in France.
