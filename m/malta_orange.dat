40|$|<b>Malta</b> <b>orange</b> (Citrus sinensis) is an {{important}} cash crop in the mountain state of Uttarakhand, India. Smallholder farmers growing it face multiple challenges due to unorganized and inaccessible markets; {{they are forced to}} sell to intermediaries at very low prices. In response, the government of Uttarakhand introduced a minimum support price for Malta oranges; however, this failed to address farmers' problems due to poor implementation. This paper presents the results of an action research project with farmers in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand to develop farmers' resilience by upgrading their position in the <b>Malta</b> <b>orange</b> value chain, targeting production, processing, and marketing through community-based enterprise development. Information was collected before and after the intervention by various means, including stakeholder meetings, focus group discussions, and interviews with farmers and value chain facilitators. Activities supported by the research have contributed to increased productivity and farmer incomes. Farmers became better organized, and their bargaining power improved considerably. The enterprise-based upgrading process brought about an inclusive and pro-poor <b>Malta</b> <b>orange</b> value chain system with improved terms of engagement for smallholder farmers. The research results show that policy change, improved provision of technical and financial services, establishment of common facility centers, and strengthening of farmers' institutions are imperative to enable smallholder farmers to engage in value chains and thus increase their resilience...|$|E

40|$|Developing a {{new product}} was the {{objectives}} of this work. For this purpose isolated caffeine from tea was added to fruit juices to make a drink that would fulfill the need of nutrition as well as stimulation. Three fruits (Pineapple, <b>Orange,</b> <b>Malta)</b> were chosen for the experiment and caffeine was extracted from tea by liquid – liquid extraction method. Extracted caffeine from made tea was purified before addition to the beverage. Preservatives, added sugar or any other additives were not used in the juice.   Fresh & Caffeinated juices were stored at three different temperatures 25 o C, 4 o C and - 15 o C to observe their shelf {{life as well as}} physicochemical and microbial changes during six days of storage. Fresh and caffeinated juices stored at room temperature (25 o C) became unacceptable after 1 day of storage, in case of 4 o C it was 5 days. The juices stored at deep freezing temperature (- 15 o C) remained acceptable up to 21 days. During storage pH of fresh and caffeinated juices were increased while acidity and vitamin C content decreased gradually. Microbial analysis showed presence of fungus in fresh and caffeinated juices and microbial loads were counted by SPC (Standard Plate Count) method. </p...|$|R
