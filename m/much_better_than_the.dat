5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> BZÖ {{in polls}} {{following}} the 2005 split, {{with the first}} tests in regional elections in Styria and Burgenland. On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as {{new chairman of the}} FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had gone over to the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its primary goal of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did reasonably well in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{historians of}} this period, such as Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink, Simon Schama and Monique Cottret, concur {{that the actual}} {{treatment}} of prisoners in Bastille was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> public impression left through these writings. Nonetheless, fuelled by the secrecy that still surrounded the Bastille, official as well as public concern about the prison and the system that supported it also began to mount, prompting reforms. As early as 1775, Louis XVI's minister Malesherbes had authorised all prisoners to be given newspapers to read, and {{to be allowed to}} write and to correspond with their family and friends. In the 1780s Breteuil, the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi, began a substantial reform of the system of lettres de cachet that sent prisoners to the Bastille: such letters were now required to list the length of time a prisoner would be detained for, and the offence for which they were being held.|$|E

25|$|Velent later {{returned}} in disguise to Niðung's kingdom {{and gave the}} daughter a love philter. The plan failed because the princess' magic knife showed her the danger before she had imbibed the potion. Velent then exchanged the knife for an ordinary knife of his own making, but when the princess noticed that the new knife was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> old one, the disguised Velent was revealed. Niðung then ordered that Velent's knee tendons be cut as a punishment and Velent was set {{to work in the}} smithy.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{produced}} in 1929–1930 and a scale-model of the aircraft was tested in the wind-tunnel. The prototype {{was built on the}} factory's own initiative and first flew in late 1930 in Biała Podlaska, piloted by Franciszek Rutkowski. In 1931 it was tested in the Aviation Technical Research Institute (ITBL) in Warsaw. It was evaluated as <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> PWS-5, with better performance, good handling and a short landing. However, the aircraft was not produced, because the Polish Air Force had just ordered a production of the Lublin R-XIII aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) {{study showed}} that CSII {{patients}} achieved an A1c of 7.3% (<b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 9.1% achieved for conventional treatment). This large and controlled study also showed that improvement in glycemic control could {{reduce the incidence of}} microvascular complications for type 1 diabetes by 60%. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) achieved similar conclusions when it studied glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The UKPDS results proved that control of glucose levels to near-normal levels delays the onset and slow the progression of microvascular complications for Type 2 diabetes.|$|E

25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Although still not perfect, the results are usually <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{operational}} design changes were also {{applied to the}} existing CANDU 6 to produce the Enhanced CANDU 6. Also known as CANDU 6e or EC 6, this was an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU 6 design with a gross output of 740 MWe per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over fifty years, with a mid-life program to replace {{some of the key}} components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual capacity factor is more than ninety percent. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs. The CANDU 6e is designed to operate at power settings as low as 50%, allowing them to adjust to load demand <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous designs.|$|E

25|$|Bras rapidly {{became a}} major {{industry}} over the 1930s, with improvements in fiber technology, fabrics, colours, patterns, and options, and did <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> retail industry in general. Innovations included Warners' use of elastic, the adjustable strap, the sized cup, and padded bras for smaller-breasted women. In the US production moved outside of New York and Chicago, and advertising started to exploit Hollywood glamour and become more specialised. Department stores developed fitting areas, and customers, stores and manufacturers all benefited. Manufacturers even arranged fitting training courses for saleswomen. International sales started to form an increasing part of the U.S. bra manufacturer's market. Prices started to make bras available to a wider market, and home-made competition dwindled. Other major manufacturers of the 1930s included Triumph, Maidenform, Gossard, (Courtaulds), Spirella, Spencer, Twilfit, and Symington.|$|E
25|$|The {{disasters}} of the VVS {{were largely}} {{down to two}} reasons; the better tactics used by the Luftwaffe {{and the lack of}} communications between Soviet pilots. The Luftwaffe used Rotte (or pairs) which relied on wingman-leader tactics. The two flew 200 metres apart, each covering the others blind spot. In combat the leader engaged while the wingman protected his tail. Two Rotte made up a Schwarm (section) and three Schwarme made up a Staffel in stepped up line astern formation. It allowed the formation to focus in looking for the enemy rather than keeping formation. Soviet aircraft fought with little regard for formation tactics, usually along or in pairs without tactical coordination. The lack of radios in aircraft made coordination worse. When the Soviets did use formation methods, the German Finger-four was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Soviet V formation.|$|E
25|$|The BBWR {{government}} bloc won {{the highest}} number of seats (125 out of 444 in Sejm (Polish parliament) - 28.12% of the total, and 48 out of 111 in the Senate of Poland - 43.24% of the total); the opposition parties, however, gained a majority of the remaining seats, with the left - including Polish Communists - doing <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> traditional Polish Right. Groth notes that the elections showed a progressively increasing fragmentation of the Polish electorate; a steady and significant increase in the proportion of ethnic minority voting; the rapid rise of the Polish Socialist Party as a major force within the far less stable and cohesive Polish Left; and the substantial weakening of the Right by Piłsudski's supporters, as the BBWR, despite its claims of being above traditional party divisions in fact attracted support mostly from the Right.|$|E

25|$|Much {{analysis}} of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain. This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a power law model <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> hyperbolic models {{that had been used}} earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations. Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.|$|E

500|$|Moore started Tittle at {{tailback}} in the single-wing formation {{his first}} year, but moved him to {{quarterback in the}} T formation during his sophomore season. As a junior in 1946, Tittle's three touchdown passes in a 41–27 rout of rival Tulane helped ensure LSU {{a spot in the}} Cotton Bowl Classic. Known notoriously as the [...] "Ice Bowl", the 1947 Cotton Bowl pitted LSU against the Arkansas Razorbacks in sub-freezing temperatures on an ice-covered field in Dallas, Texas. LSU moved the ball <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Razorbacks, but neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0–0 tie. Tittle and Arkansas end Alton Baldwin shared the game's MVP award. Following the season, United Press International (UPI) placed Tittle on its All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) first-team.|$|E

Another case is the novel Shamela by Henry Fielding (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy epistolary novel Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) by Samuel Richardson. Many of Lewis Carroll's parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as [...] "You Are Old, Father William", are <b>much</b> <b>better</b> known <b>than</b> <b>the</b> (largely forgotten) originals. Stella Gibbons's comic novel Cold Comfort Farm has eclipsed the pastoral novels of Mary Webb which largely inspired it.|$|R
