5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass <b>Mild</b> brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass <b>Mild</b> had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones <b>Mild</b> and Stones Dark <b>Mild</b> respectively.|$|E

5|$|Prognosis worsens {{with the}} {{severity}} of injury. Most TBIs are <b>mild</b> and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI {{have the potential to}} cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of <b>mild</b> injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most <b>mild</b> TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with <b>mild</b> TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have <b>mild</b> cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E

5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from <b>mild</b> to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are <b>mild</b> and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be <b>mild,</b> {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to <b>mild</b> impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E
