40|$|<b>Magnetotelluric</b> <b>sounding</b> {{at a site}} in the Transverse Ranges {{province}} in southern California indicates a low-resistivity region in the lower crust and possibly also the upper mantle. A two-dimensional model fit to the data indicates that the resistivity of this region is between 1 and 10 ohm-meters. The depth to the top surface of this zone is between 15 and 20 km. The lateral extent of this feature, which strikes N 65 deg W, appears to be confined to the Transverse Ranges province. The petrological characteristics of this region cannot be deduced unambiguously from the <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>sounding</b> alone...|$|E

30|$|There {{exists a}} number of models that account for the deep {{structure}} of the Sayan-Baikal province {{on the basis of}} different geophysical data. The models based on <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings</b> differ from those obtained from seismology with no regard to <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings</b> (MTS) results. To decide between the active and passive mechanisms of Baikal rifting, we propose to correlate the modeling results to the available seismological and petrological data, {{as well as to the}} model of asthenospheric diapirism put forward by Zorin et al. (1989, 1990, 1995). Inasmuch as the reality of MTS-based models depends on removal of static-shift effects, the reported three-dimensional modeling of the Baikal rift deep structure was preceded by normalization of the original MT curves by the global magnetovariation curve. The enhanced electrical conductivities of the crust and upper mantle of the region is interpreted in terms of geodynamics where the Cenozoic activity is suggested to be driven by convective mantle flow and triggered by the associated plate collisions. The origin and evolution of the Baikal rift can be explained in terms of reactivation of a pre-existing lithospheric inhomogeneity between the Siberian craton and the Sayan-Baikal fold area.|$|R

Theoretical calculations of these fields on structures defined by the interpretation of magnetotelluric sounds, or by geological and other geophysical data, agree very well with experimental data.

We estimated the resistivity model at the depth from the surface to 10 km, which explains the observed apparent resistivities and phases. The most remarkable feature of the resistivity model is that the subsurface extension of the MTL has a north dip down to 5 km depth. This dipping interface also corresponds to a reflection seismic result. The north dipping MTL cannot be created by just a present strike slip motion.

Reliable data were procured for each site covering the period range from lo 3 to lo 4 s and following the usual methods of magnetotelluric interpretation, information on electrical conductivity is obtained at upper mantle depths. The conclusion is drawn that at these depths, the con-ductivity is higher, by an order of magnitude, beneath the geosyncline than {{to the west of}} it. This result is interpreted as indicating higher temperatures which are due to, or perhaps cause, the tectonic activity which has characterized the geosyncline, and which is still evident in seismicity studies of the present day.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{electrical resistivity}} structure beneath Naruko volcano was determined using <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings.</b> The resulting model {{shows that a}} prominent conductor exists through the middle crust to the uppermost mantle beneath the volcano. The location of the conductor agrees closely with a seismic low-velocity zone. Low-frequency microearthquakes occur near the conductor around the Moho depth. The cutoff depth of crustal earthquakes is coincident with the upper boundary of the conductor, implying that the conductor has a temperature appreciably higher than 400 ∘C. Furthermore, new helium isotope data from hot springs around the volcano were obtained. The spatial distribution of the observed 3 He/ 4 He ratios reveals the extent of mantle-derived materials beneath Naruko volcano. Consequently, {{it is apparent that}} the conductor determined beneath the volcano reflects the presence of high-temperature mantle-derived materials such as magmas and/or related fluids derived from active magmatism in the northeastern Japan subduction zone...|$|R

For all these profiles two-dimensional models are presented. Extensive comparative model studies of microscopic and macroscopic anisotropy were carried out.

Gravity anomalies are strongly affected by the variations of morphology of the top of the sedimentary basement, consisting of a Tertiary flysch, and of the interface with the underlying Mesozoic carbonates.

It is characterized tectonically as a highly-disturbed zone in Indian geology since Precambrian times. A magnetotelluric (MT) study has been carried out across the NSL zone along a 270 -km-long N-S-trending traverse, extending from Hoshangabad in the North to Ner in the South. As a part of the present study, 25 <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings</b> have been collected and the data rotated to N 70 °E after removing local distortions, arising from 3 D galvanic effects, using the Groom-Bailey decomposition technique. 2 -D inversion has been carried out using an NLCG scheme. The results derived from the 2 -D inversion have brought out the highly conductive nature of the mid-lower crust at places coinciding with the known faults. The significant high heat flow and seismicity in the region associated with these faults may be caused by tectonic activity and the highly conductive nature of the mid-lower crust. This may be due to the partial melting of subsurface rocks resulting from the high temperature caused by mantle upwarping in the region. The results are also compared with the gravity and a nearby Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS).|$|R

Both overall deflation and inflation/deflation episodes (Phases 3 a, 3 b, 3 c) apparently activated {{other parts of the}} hydrothermal system, producing seismic swarms, huge electrical signals, large changes in thermal fluxes, and transitory re-opening of fissures due to fluids expansion in the porous media (Figs.  7 c and 11 c).

40|$|Conductivity models {{beneath the}} Nanga Parbat Haramosh Massif (NPHM) derived from <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings</b> reveal {{that there is}} no widespread, interconnected, {{conductive}} aqueous fluid to minimum depths of 40 km below sea level. Given the continuing tectonic denudation, young granitic and migmatitic bodies indicating partial melt at shallow crustal depths, and active seismicity, this result is surprising in light of similar studies in active tectonic regimes elsewhere. Away from the NPHM, models reveal the usual conductive lower crust. We propose that deep magmatic and metamorphic fluids are produced beneath NPHM in isolated zones but that the active deformation permits their escape through the brittle–ductile transition. A magnetotelluric survey in an area as complicated as Nanga Parbat required the development of methodologies for utilizing standard two-dimensional inversions in a three-dimensional environment. We show here how to identify which parts of the magnetotelluric responses are adequately represented with two-dimensional approximations. Unlike previous efforts, we do not attempt to create a set of generic rules that may be applicable to all geologic environments. Instead, a procedure is outlined that can be tailored to each interpretation.

However, a particularly notable event was the shallow, normal-faulting earthquake swarms with a T-axis oriented in the E–W or NW–SE directions that occurred immediately after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake near the Pacific coast in the Southeast Tohoku district. The stress tensor inversion represents the pre-Tohoku-Oki earthquake stress field in this area as a normal-faulting stress regime with the minimum principal horizontal stress oriented in a roughly NW–SE direction. Additionally, the stress regime varies with depth from normal faulting at shallow depths (< 15  km) to thrust faulting at greater depths. Seismic tomography and <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>soundings</b> defined a geophysical anomaly with low seismic velocity and low resistivity clearly visible beneath the swarm activity, strongly supporting {{the existence of an}} interconnected network with fluid-filled porosity. The upper boundary of the conductor is in good agreement with an extensional–compressional stress transition zone. A plausible explanation for these drastic changes in the stress regime is upward flexure of the upper crust due to partly anelastic deformation in the weakened lower crust. Additionally, remarkable upwarping and localized extensional tectonics during the late Pleistocene reflect the long-term rheological heterogeneities in the crust beneath the seismic source region.|$|R
