This capstone examines characteristics and diagnostic terminology used to encompass various forms of mild impairments in cognition, the unmet needs of those with these conditions, <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> that have the potential to address these needs, and technology adoption considerations. User personas based on the literature review provide examples of how <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> can be incorporated {{to meet the needs of}} this population. Findings from the literature review indicate that certain <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> match with the needs of this population and could be utilized if technology adoption barriers are addressed. Given these findings, a research proposal is made for a feasibility study investigating a peer-led <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> training program to facilitate goal achievement for older adults with mild impairments in cognition...|$|R
30|$|In view of {{this and}} given the {{popularity}} of <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> in healthcare, we aimed to identify contemporary radiology-related <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications,</b> including teaching, reference and DICOM viewing applications, and assess the level of advertised medical involvement in application development.|$|R
30|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{showed a}} small to moderate effect {{of physical activity}} interventions comprising wearables and <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> on physical activity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{explosion}} {{of technology in}} hotel industry has promoted the appearance of adoption of <b>Smartphone's</b> <b>Application</b> as part of hotels new marketing strategy. Hotels annually spend a huge portion of investment on maintaining this <b>Smartphone's</b> <b>application</b> benefits to their guests but the application is still questionable, {{probably due to the}} application is still new in Malaysia. Thus, the benefits of <b>Smartphone's</b> <b>Application</b> should be carefully designed by hoteliers in acquiring new as well as existing guests to their hotel. This study draws on in-depth interviews of 12 hotel executives from either Marketing or Information Technology (IT) department to investigate the benefit structures of this <b>Smartphone's</b> <b>application</b> of each hotel. It aims to compare and analyze the taxonomical benefits of the <b>Smartphone's</b> <b>application</b> offered by six (6) hotels ranging from 3 to 5 star city hotels in Malaysia. The recorded tapes and transcripts derived from the interviews were repeatedly reviewed, coded and summarized into categories...|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, nobody of {{the persons}} who had {{answered}} in Question 16 to use a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> for their SVHC request chose the option ‘does not work’, although all but one had presumably used <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> which could not answer SVHC requests (Fig.  2).|$|R
30|$|Worldwide {{physical}} activity levels of adults are declining, which is associated with increased chronic disease risk. Wearables and <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> offer new opportunities to change {{physical activity}} behaviour. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding the effect of wearables and <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> on promoting physical activity.|$|R
30|$|More persons {{made the}} effort to {{formulate}} the inquiry themselves compared to the participants who used a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> or the UBA sample letter. In our survey, 15 persons declared to use a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> for the SVHC requests and had answered the questionnaire before the 20 th of October, but, at that time, no <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> for the SVHC requests existed in German language. The upgrade of the ToxFox for SVHC requests had just become available on 20 th of October, 2016. The <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> Scan 4 Chem was not usable yet for the public, and CodeCheck does not inform about SVHCs. We assume that these 15 study participants did not apply the Danish tool Tjek Kemien [11], as this <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> is available only in Danish language. These participants apparently assumed erroneously to have received SVHC data by the basic ToxFox application (which dealt with endocrine disrupting substances in cosmetics only before the upgrade was installed) or by the CodeCheck application. Three of these persons had also indicated to use other methods. Interestingly, 10 of these 15 persons who indicated erroneously to have used a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> for SVHC requests found this method good (Question 20). Therefore, we cannot consider those survey participants, who indicated to use <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> as only method, as participants who make SVHC requests. This means that only 42 persons declared to make SVHC requests, which are only 4 % of the total of the  1030 participants who had answered the complete survey. We assume that the other methods for SVHC requests indicated by these 42 users were applied correctly. Three persons indicated to use two different methods and one person indicated three different methods (if the users of <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> before the 20 th October are not counted).|$|R

Research has shown that traditional usability evaluation methods cannot be readily applied to the evaluation of native <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications.</b> This research investigates this issue by adapting two usability evaluation methods, applying each at different stages of the design life cycle. Both adapted methods, when combined as a framework, may help in the design of more usable native <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
30|$|Studies also {{varied in}} number and {{combination}} of included intervention components and behaviour change techniques. Promotion of physical activity through a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> in combination with a wearable is in most studies accompanied by other intervention components, such as counselling sessions. Hence, no conclusions could be drawn about the isolated effect of wearables and <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> on physical activity. Schoeppe et al. [28] showed that only offering a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> is less effective than offering a <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> with additional intervention components. As a result, compared to only offering a wearable and <b>smartphone</b> <b>application,</b> intervention effects may be larger when the intervention is accompanied with other intervention components. Furthermore, goal setting {{is one of the}} most important behaviour change techniques to increase physical activity [53]. In most studies, physical activity goals were individualized, which may be more effective in promoting physical activity compared to general physical activity goals [55]. Other sources of heterogeneity might be variation in intervention duration and differences between control groups across studies, ranging from usual care to having a physical activity goal.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> {{for mental}} {{illnesses}} offer great potential, although the actual research base is still limited. Major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are both common psychiatric illness for which <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> research has greatly expanded {{in the last}} two years. We review the literature on <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> for major depressive and bipolar disoders in order to better understand the evidence base for their use, current research opportunities, and future clinical trends. Methods: We conducted an English language review of the literature, on November 1 st 2014, for <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> for major depressive and bipolar disorders. Inclusion criteria included studies featuring modern <b>smartphones</b> running native <b>applications</b> with outcome data related to major depressive or bipolar disorders. Studies were organized by use of active or passive data collection and focus on diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Results: Our search identified 1065 studies. Ten studies on major depressive disorder and 4 on bipolar disorder were included. Nine out of 10 studies on depression related <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> featured active data collection and all 4 studies on bipolar disorder featured passive data collection. Depression studies included both diagnostic and therapeutic <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications,</b> while bipolar disorder studies featured only diagnostics. No studies addressed physiological data. Conclusions: While the research base for <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> is limited, it is still informative. Numerous opportunities for further research exist, especially in the use of passive data for, major depressive disorder, validating passive data to detect mania in bipolar disorder, and exploring the use of physiological data. As interest in smartphones for psychiatry and mental health continues to expand, {{it is important that the}} research base expands to fill these gaps and provide clinically useful results...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate {{the impact of a}} <b>smartphone</b> <b>application</b> as an adjunct to face-to-face consultations in facilitating dietary and physical activity change among pregnant women. This multicentre, nested randomised trial involved pregnant women with a body mass index ≥ 18. 5  kg/m(2), with a singleton pregnancy between 10 and 20  weeks' gestation, and participating in 2 pregnancy nutrition-based randomised trials across metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. All women participating in the SNAPP trial received a comprehensive dietary, physical activity, and behavioural intervention, as part of the GRoW or OPTIMISE randomised trials. Women were subsequently randomised to either the "Lifestyle Advice Only Group," where women received the above intervention, or the "Lifestyle Advice plus <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Application</b> Group," where women were additionally provided access to the <b>smartphone</b> <b>application.</b> The primary outcome was healthy eating index (HEI) assessed by maternal food frequency questionnaire completed at trial entry, and 28 and 36  weeks' gestation. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principles, with statistical significance at p = . 05. One hundred sixty-two women participated: 77 allocated to the Lifestyle Advice plus <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Application</b> Group and 85 to the Lifestyle Advice Only Group. Mean difference in HEI score at 28  weeks of pregnancy was 0. 01 (CI [- 2. 29, 2. 62]) and at 36  weeks of pregnancy - 1. 16 (CI [- 4. 60, 2. 28]).

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{smartphone}} market and its increasing revenue has motivated developers to target multiple platforms. Market leaders, such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, develop their <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> complying with their platform specifications. The specification of each platform makes a platform-dedicated application incompatible with other platforms due to the diversity of operating systems, programming languages, and design patterns. Conventional development methodologies are applied to <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications,</b> yet they perform less well. <b>Smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> have unique hardware and software requirements. All previous factors push smartphone developers to build less sophisticated and low-quality products when targeting multiple smartphone platforms. Model-driven development have been considered to generate <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> from abstract models to alleviate smartphones platform fragmentation.
