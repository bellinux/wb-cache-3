25|$|On {{the local}} {{personal}} names, {{less than two}} hundred are known, {{many of which are}} also present either in the Lusitania, or either among the Astures, or among the Celtiberians. Whilst many of them have a sure Celtic etymology, frequently related to war, fame or valour, others show preservation of /p/ and so are probably Lusitanian better than properly Celtic; in any case, many names could be Celtic or Lusitanian, or even belong to another indo-European local language. Among the most frequent names are Reburrus, Camalus (related to Old Irish cam 'battle, encounter'), Caturus (to Celtic *katu- 'fight'), Cloutius (to Celtic *klouto- 'renown', with the derivatives Clutamus 'Very Famous' and Cloutaius, and the composite Vesuclotus '(He who have) Good Fame'), Medamus, Boutius, Lovesius, Pintamus, Ladronus, Apilus, Andamus (<b>maybe</b> <b>to</b> Celtic and-amo- 'The Undermost'), Bloena, Aebura/Ebura, Albura, Arius, Caelius and Caelicus (to Celtic *kaylo- 'omen'), Celtiatis, Talavius, Viriatus, among others.|$|E

500|$|Having lost a {{significant}} amount of his vision in his left eye, Malhotra struggled in his first full season since the injury in 2011–12. He was supplanted as the Canucks' third-line centre by rookie Cody Hodgson and later Samuel Pahlsson. Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault assessed Malhotra during the season as [...] "not the same physical player he was before," [...] adding that [...] "He's still contributing but not <b>maybe</b> <b>to</b> the degree that he was before he got injured." [...] Playing left wing on the fourth line, he remained {{an integral part of the}} team by playing on the penalty kill and taking important defensive zone faceoffs. Near the end of the campaign, Malhotra was chosen as the Canucks' nominee for the Bill Masterton Trophy, an annual NHL award for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. With a diminished offensive role, Malhotra finished his second season in Vancouver with 7 goals and 18 points over 78 games, as well as a -10 plus-minus rating. He remained among the league's elite in terms of faceoffs, however, ranking fourth with a 58.5% percentage.|$|E

2500|$|Perchance to Dream {{is written}} {{as a direct}} sequel to The Big Sleep, the title {{of which is a}} {{euphemism}} for death. (The older novel includes a philosophical reflection on [...] "sleeping the big sleep".) [...] Continuing the play on words, the sequel derives its name from famous lines from Prince Hamlet's soliloquy in Hamlet, a tragedy by William Shakespeare: [...] "to die: to sleep— / To sleep, perchance to dream" [...] (Act 3, Scene 1, Lines 63–64). [...] One reviewer snarkily suggested alternate titles including <b>Maybe</b> <b>to</b> Dream, The Bigger Sleep, and Sleep Bigger.|$|E

2500|$|Although ETA has {{a history}} of {{mounting}} bomb attacks in Madrid, the 11 March attacks exceeded any attack previously attempted by a European organisation. This led some experts {{to point out that the}} tactics used were more typical of Islamist militant extremist groups, perhaps with a certain link to al-Qaeda, or <b>maybe</b> <b>to</b> a new generation of ETA activists using al-Qaeda as a role model. Observers also noted that ETA customarily, but not always, issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there had been no warning for this attack. Europol director Jürgen Storbeck commented that the bombings [...] "could have been ETA... But we're dealing with an attack that doesn't correspond to the modus operandi they have adopted up to now".|$|E

2500|$|Following the TNI investigation, Prabowo {{acknowledged}} {{responsibility for}} the kidnapping of the activists. He was discharged from military service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge {{was a result of}} disciplinary action. In August 1998, the Dewan Kehormatan Perwira (Officers Council of Honor) tried, and found Prabowo guilty of [...] "misinterpreting orders" [...] in the kidnapping of anti-Suharto activists in 1998. He was discharged from military services, and went into a voluntary exile in Jordan where he knew that country's new young King Abdullah as a fellow commander of special forces. In an interview for Asia Now in 2000, Prabowo said [...] "I never threatened Habibie. I was not behind the riots. That is a great lie. I never betrayed Pak Harto. I never betrayed Habibie. I never betrayed my country...There was a certain group that wanted to make me a scapegoat, <b>maybe</b> <b>to</b> hide their involvement."" [...] Rights groups have long questioned Prabowo's eligibility to run for president, noting that he was discharged dishonourably from the Army in August 1998 for [...] "misinterpreting orders" [...] in the abduction of the democracy activists. While that was the military's official statement, observers have long believed that it was a coup conspiracy that saw Prabowo, then the commander of the Army Strategic Reserves, given his marching orders.|$|E
