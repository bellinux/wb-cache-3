60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Page,</b> albeit she was poor--nobody but herself {{knew how}} poor--and a widow with five {{children}} besides Dorinda, hesitated at first. She was afraid, with good reason, that the winter might stretch into other seasons; but Mary {{had lost her}} own only little girl in the summer, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Page</b> shuddered {{at the thought of}} what her loneliness must be. So, to comfort her, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Page</b> had let Dorinda go, stipulating that she must come home in the spring. In the spring, when Dorinda's bed of violets was growing purple under the lilac bush, Aunt Mary wrote again. Dorinda was contented and happy, she said. Would not Emily let her stay for the summer? <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Page</b> cried bitterly over that letter and took sad counsel with herself. To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for the summer really meant, she knew, to let her stay altogether. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Page</b> was finding it harder and harder to get along; there was so little and the children needed so much; Dorinda would have a good home with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother heart to give her up. In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for the summer--and Dorinda had never been home since.|$|R

60|$|My friend went {{on summer}} {{vacation}} {{up into the}} fishing regions of our northern British neighbors, and carried this sermon with him, since he might possibly chance to need a sermon.

60|$|In 1691, when Steele {{was a boy}} at school, my Lord Mohun {{was tried}} by his peers {{for the murder of}} William Mountford, comedian. In Howell’s State Trials, the reader will find not only an edifying account of this {{exceedingly}} fast nobleman, but of the times and manners of those days. My lord’s friend, a Captain Hill, smitten with the charms of the beautiful Mrs. Bracegirdle, and anxious to marry her at all hazards, determined to carry her off, and for this purpose hired a hackney-coach with six horses, and a half-dozen of soldiers, to aid him in the storm. The coach with a pair of horses (the four leaders being in waiting elsewhere) took its station opposite my Lord Craven’s house in Drury Lane, by which door Mrs. Bracegirdle was to pass on her way from the theatre. As she passed in company of her mamma and a friend, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Page,</b> the Captain seized her by the hand, the soldiers hustled <b>Mr.</b> <b>Page</b> and attacked him sword in hand, and Captain Hill and his noble friend endeavoured to force Madam Bracegirdle into the coach. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Page</b> called for help: the population of Drury Lane rose: it was impossible to effect the capture; and bidding the soldiers go about their business, and the coach to drive off, Hill let go of his prey sulkily, and he waited for other opportunities of revenge. The man of whom he was most jealous was Will Mountford, the comedian; Will removed, he thought Mrs. Bracegirdle might be his: and accordingly the Captain and his lordship lay that night in wait for Will, and as he was coming out of a house in Norfolk Street, while Mohun engaged him in talk, Hill, {{in the words of the}} Attorney-General, made a pass and run him clean through the body.|$|E

6000|$|When Ephraim {{came home}} to supper that evening, he brought the Brampton Clarion, just out, and in it was an account of Miss Lucretia Penniman's speech at the mass meeting, and of her visit, and of her career. It was written in Mr. Page's best vein, and so laudatory was it that we shall have to spare Miss Lucretia in not repeating it here: yes, and omit the encomiums, too, on the teacher of the Brampton lower school. Mr. Worthington was not mentioned, and for this, at least, Cynthia drew along breath of relief, though Ephraim was {{of the opinion that}} the first citizen should have been scored as he deserved, and held up to the {{contempt}} of his fellow-townsmen. The dismissal of the teacher, indeed, was put down to a regrettable misconception on the part of [...] "one of the prudential committee," [...] who had confessed his mistake in [...] "a manly and altogether praiseworthy speech." [...] The article was as near the truth, perhaps, as the Clarions may come on such matters--which is not very near. Cynthia would have been better pleased if <b>Mr.</b> <b>Page</b> had spared his readers the recital of her qualities, and she did not in the least recognize the paragon whom Miss Lucretia had befriended and defended. She was thankful that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Page</b> did pot state that the celebrity had come up from Boston on her account. Miss Penniman had been [...] "actuated by a sudden desire to see once more the beauties of her old home, to look into the faces of the old friends who had followed her career with such pardonable pride."
