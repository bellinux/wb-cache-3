40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of comparative analysis of influence of different methods of TDC determination for the calculation errors of <b>mean</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP). Lemag method based on zero point of first order derivative, used in PREMET pressure analyzers, was compared to the method based on a polynomial model of the compression process. Comparisons were made on the operating measurement data obtained on the low speed marine engine RTA 96 C which forms the main propulsion of the vessel and the medium speed engine MAN L 28 / 32 A. Measurements were made with onboard combustion PREMET analyzer. It was found that the method based on zero point of first order derivative can give the deviations of position of TDC in excess of 2 °CA which is caused by disturbances associated with the measurement of pressure and interference associated with the generation of the angular axis. These errors are related to the accuracy of the methods of determining of the first derivative and the availability of a sufficient range of pure compression after TDC. The best results of determining the TDC position was obtained from the original method based on a polynomial model of the compression process. It should be emphasized that the proposed method enables individual adjustment of TDC for each cylinder and can be used even when the combustion begins before TDC. The conducted research proved the existence of significant influence of indicator graph TDC location on the <b>mean</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> calculation errors...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} biological fuel {{which has}} higher density and viscosity {{as compared to}} mineral diesel. However, the simple approach to reduce the viscosity of biodiesel is to blend the mineral diesel with biodiesel. While the use of alcohol additives (ethanol and methanol) in the biodiesel blends fuel is to make lesser viscosity of the blend fuel. Different fuel properties produce different combustion characteristics of the blend fuels. Combustion studies on mineral diesel, B 20 (biodiesel 20 % + diesel 80 %) and B 20 blend fuels with alcohol additives (B 20 E 5 and B 20 M 5) were carried out using a Mitsubishi 4 D 68 multi-cylinder diesel engine. The combustion characteristics of an indirect injection diesel engine were examined by means of cyclic variation of peak cylinder pressure and <b>mean</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP). In-cylinder pressure was investigated for the various pressure crank angle history in this study. Statistical analysis of combustion characteristics for diesel engine {{have been carried out}} on three different engine loads; 20 %, 40 % and 60 % at a constant engine speed of 2500 rpm using a combustion data of 200 cycles. The results show that at lower load, mineral diesel dominated the maximum peak cylinder pressure compared to other test fuels. However at higher load, B 20, B 20 E 5 and B 20 have surpassed mineral diesel for the maximum peak cylinder. It also remarked the variations of peak cylinder pressure of the test fuels influence most the <b>mean</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP) at three different engine loads...|$|E

50|$|The <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> {{effective}} <b>pressure</b> of the Hispano-Suiza {{engine is}} slightly {{greater than that}} of the Liberty 12, at the same air density and compression ration. This is explained by the less amount of heating with the H-S manifold jackets. When the air supply is at 32 °F the manifold temperature of the H-S is about 14 °F, while that of the Liberty is about 41 °F. For a given temperature and a given pressure of air supply, the actual density of the air entering the cylinders is reduced by heating, although it is also increased by the cooling resulting from the evaporation of the gasoIine. Using the manifold density instead of the supply density, the two engines give the same mean effective pressure for the same density.Apparently the relation between <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> and air supply density is based upon the fact that the change of <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> is proportional to the change of density of the charge at the beginning of compression, irrespective of whether the density is changed by altitude or by throttling.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of blending hydrogen (from 0 to 50 % vol.) on the parameters and the cyclic variability of a Lombardini LGW 702 combustion engine powered by natural gas. The experimental measurements were carried out at various air excess ratios and at various angles of spark advance, at an operating speed of 1500 min − 1. An analysis of the combustion pressure showed that as the proportion of hydrogen in the mixture increases, the maximum pressure value also increases. However, {{at the same time}} the cyclic variability decreases. Both the ignition-delay period and the period of combustion of the mixture become shorter, which requires optimization of the spark advance angle for various proportions of hydrogen in the fuel.

Tests at other speeds with this length of pipe showed higher <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> than with a very short pipe, although not so high as could be obtained with the pipe length adjusted for each speed. A general relation was discovered between optimum time of inlet valve closing and pipe length; namely, that longer pipes require later inlet valve closing in order to be fully effective. Tests were also made on three cylinders connected to a single pipe. With this arrangement, increased volumetric efficiency at low speed was obtainable by using a long pipe, but only with a sacrifice of volumetric efficiency at high speed.

Three alternative fuels and the regular diesel oil (RD) were tested. The alternative fuels are: (1) mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and anhydrous ethanol (ET), (2) mixture of FAME and ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), and (3) mixture of RD and ETBE. Using statistical and wavelet analyses, we investigated the cycle-to-cycle MIP variations for each fuel, at three engine speeds of 1200, 1600 and 2000 rpm. The results for the alternative fuels were compared with those for RD. At all three speeds, the MIP variations for the alternative fuels were found to exhibit strong periodicities of 64 - 256 cycles, and these periodicities persist over many engine cycles, whereas shorter-term periodicities at 2 - 32 cycles appeared to be intermittent. In the case of RD, the MIP variations with longer periodicities appeared only at the highest engine speed but intermittent fluctuations of 2 - 32 cycles are present at all three speeds.

40|$|The design {{trend for}} light duty diesel engines is towards lower {{compression}} ratio and higher turbocharger boost. This can enable higher specific power and lower pollutant emissions to be achieved, but raises concerns that cold start operation might be adversely affected. This is investigated and quantified through {{the study of}} a modern light duty diesel engine at two compression ratios and temperatures down to - 20 ºC. Key indicators of cold start performance are the magnitude and cycle-to-cycle variation of <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure.</b> Initial {{studies were carried out}} at 300 rpm, a speed representative of post-first-fire conditions. Studies were then conducted at higher engine speeds representative of cold idle. The utility of different injection strategies, timings and quantities is investigated when varying test temperature and engine speed through a range of values encountered during the cold start phase of engine operation. The importance of the glow plug as a cold start aid is also investigated by varying its operating temperature and protrusion into the combustion chamber. The <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> was used to assess the effects of varying input parameters, and gross heat release rate information is used to identify the phenomena responsible for desirable or undesirable characteristics. Reduction in compression ratio led to no deterioration of initial start performance from speeds just above cranking, provided an appropriate injection strategy was chosen. Higher <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> was possible at low speeds using low compression ratio due to reduced losses and more complete combustion. Cycle-to-cycle variability in <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> increased markedly for both compression ratios at engine speeds representative of cold idle, especially when test temperature was reduced. Stability reduction was more severe at low compression ratio. Multiple pilot injections at high compression ratio cold idle resulted in better cycle-to-cycle stability. Analysis of heat release profiles suggested that additional pilots assisted fuel mixing, a conclusion supported by a computational fluid dynamics model. Multiple pilots created a more homogeneous fuel distribution through the bowl at time of main injection. Multiple pilots could not stabilise operation at low compression ratio. Improvement in cold idle at low compression ratio was achieved by increasing glow plug temperature, which significantly increased the rate of fuel preparation. This increased the initial rate of heat release and resulted in significantly less variation in the heat release rate profiles. Small changes in glow plug protrusion rapidly degraded cold idle performance, indicating the importance of correct design...|$|R

The combustion and emission characteristics are investigated with variation of intake air temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and intake air pressure. The results show that intake air temperature has great influence on HCCI combustion characteristic. Increased intake air temperature results in advance combustion phase, shorten combustion duration, and lower <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> effective <b>pressure</b> (IMEP).

The effect {{of changes in the}} following engine operating variables on preignition limit was determined: inlet-air temperature, rear spark plug gasket temperature, engine speed, spark advance, tappet clearance, and oil consumption. Preignition limits of the R- 2800 cylinder using Champion C 34 S and C 35 S and AC-LS 86, LS 87, and LS 88 spark plugs were established and the effect of spark plug deterioration was investigated.

The R- 2800 cylinder is therefore relatively insensitive to fuel composition when compared to a CFR F- 4 engine, which had a pre-ignition range from 72 to 100 percent for the same fuels.

Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually. This study describes and suggests new methodology to measure compression pressure by analysis of start motor current and to check valve timing by cylinder pressure with high accuracy. With this new methodology, possibility to detec...|$|R

The aim of the analysis {{was to determine the}} differences in the combustion process between the engine with a classic multipoint injection system and a system wh ich injects fuel directly to the cylinders as well. To aid in the analysis the measuremen ts of the high variable pressure in th e engine's cylinder against the crankshaft angle were taken. This allowed us to obtain indicated diagrams for both types o f engines. To eliminate distortions, both functions were approximated using combined functions. Th e other basic parameters were also measu red: torque, RPM and insta ntaneous fuel consumption. The analysis of the indicated diagrams yielded an <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> and thermal e fficiency for both fuel systems. Then, a comprehensive analysis of pressures in cylin ders was performed {{in order to determine the}} way the flame spreads in the cylinder for the two types of engines. The results obtained from this analysis show that the speed of combustion is grea ter for the charge formed by the dual-injector fuel system. The increased spee d of the combustion, especially when it reaches a 50 % fraction of the exhaust gas in the cylinder, is what accounts for the increase in the <b>indicated</b> <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> and the increase in the thermal efficiency of the engine with a dual-injector fuel system. The time of the spreading of the flame, as well as the fast burn period were reduced. The increased eff iciency of the combustion process in the cylinder means tha t the heat losses through the cylinder sleeve are greatly reduced. The results of the research in th is paper confirm the purposefulness of using a dual-injector fuel system in a spark-ignition engine...|$|R
