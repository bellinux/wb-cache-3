500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

[...] The executive elder stated that he was blackmailed by a staff who asked for more severance pay. He also stated that [...] "former Mars Hill elders were working to file formal charges against me also.

2500|$|Throughout the novel, Richard both pontificates on {{and must}} {{actively}} deal with morality. His first {{reaction to the}} job offer that starts off the plot is objection to its dubious moral standpoint - Zapparoni wants someone to do his dirty work for him in dealing with deserting engineers. His decision to work for Zapparoni, an incredibly powerful man, {{calls into question the}} relationship between power and morality: according to one interpretation, “We come to discover a world where the desperate struggle for survival and success leaves power unmitigated by any recognizable form of morality.” Richard himself suffers insecurity about his morals, wondering if he is being silly for sticking by them in such a world. Late in the novel, Richard proclaims “The moment has now come when I ought to speak of morality. This is one of my weak points: therefore I shall be brief. My unlucky star had destined me to be born when there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> morality and, at the same time, more murders than in any other period...” [...] While the novel doesn’t come to any grand conclusion about morality, it raises questions about whether individual morality is possible within a world determined by power and success, in which the meaning of conventional moral precepts has become as ambiguous as the distinction between natural and artificial.|$|E
