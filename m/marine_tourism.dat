Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing {{to be out in the}} open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.|$|E

40|$|<b>Marine</b> {{wildlife}} <b>tourism</b> is a small, {{but increasingly}} important, part of Scotland’s tourism image. As fishing and agricultural industries struggle, specialist sectors, such as whale-watching, can attract tourists to remote rural {{areas in the}} Scottish Highlands, thereby contributing to the local economy. This study considers the social, economic and educational impacts of marine wildlife boat trips on the island community of Mull, West Scotland (with a special focus on whale-watching). Data was gathered from questionnaires given to tourists taking boat trips from Mull. The data was then {{used to create a}} visitor profile and to assess the status of <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> on the island. Results showed that visitors taking marine wildlife boat trips tended to be well-educated, environmentally aware, middle-aged and likely to have a high disposable income. The visitor profile reflected previous studies of whale-watcher profiles. Passengers also had a good knowledge of, and interest in, marine issues. <b>Marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> is well-established on Mull and a range of trips are on offer to the visitor. An estimated value for the industry was calculated (£ 650, 000) and the wider implications discussed.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{does not}} have an abstract. The introduction is displayed as the abstract. Wildlife-based tours in marine and coastal areas provide a range of psychological, educational and conservation benefits for visitors encountering marine animals (Higham, 1998; Drams, 2000; Schanzel and Mclntosh, 2000; Luck, 2003; Flnkler and Higham, 2004; Mayes et al., 2004; Hughes and Saunders, 2005; Tisdell and Wilson, 2005; Andersen and Miller, 2006). This chapter reviews and evaluates benefits for participants on marine wildlife tours. The focus is on non-consumptlve, free-ranging <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> where visitors can view, photograph, feed, and swim with, or assist in research on, marine animals in their natural habitats. Other broader participants include the marine tour operators, coastal and island communities in marine areas and researchers studying marine wildlife and/or tourists. Most research on <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> addresses environmental impacts on sea animals, industry compliance with codes of conduct and managing visitor interactions with marine species. However, this chapter reviews studies that primarily focus on tourist experiences of marine and coastal wildlife in Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and western Canada/USA. Much of this research on <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> is site or species specific and limited to one type of encounter. There is a need for more systematic, in-depth evaluation of <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> experiences and educational programmes to identify techniques that increase tourist benefits and knowledge, promoting attitude shifts and lifestyle changes (Samuels et al., 2003). In addition, both on-site and longer-term conservation behaviours that benefit marine wildlife and marine environments need to be explored. This chapter introduces marine wildlife tours and visitor benefits from marine wildlife encounters, then critically reviews the psychological, educational and conservation benefits of tourist participation in a range of marine wildlife experiences. ...|$|R

40|$|Good {{governance}} of consumptive wildlife tourism, a complex socio-ecological system, requires {{finding the right}} balance between natural resource and tourism management. Fishing takes the lead globally as the most popular product offering within consumptive wildlife tourism, and both Iceland and Norway offer a <b>marine</b> angling <b>tourism</b> product. The two countries offer similar pristine Arctic fjord topography and similar fish species; but the management strategies are very different. Iceland’s management strategy for <b>marine</b> angling <b>tourism</b> prioritizes ecosystem-based management of the fish as a living resource, and requires a full accounting of all statistics related to marine angling tourists’ activities. Norway’s strategy relies on estimates of key statistics such as total seasonal catch, and the regulations put the burden of accountability primarily on the tourists. Using data from a multiple case study analysis of <b>marine</b> angling <b>tourism</b> in Iceland and Norway, the differences in governance inter-dynamics are examined using a theoretical model developed to analyse a complex socio-ecological system as an institution. This paper analyses how the differing management strategies influence institutional function, conflict creation and mitigation. Special focus {{is placed on the}} impacts of non-compliance by the tourists. This study demonstrates how such a model can serve as a tool to perform an analysis of a socio-ecological system in order to better understand institutional inter-dynamics, thereby assisting {{in the creation of a}} more effective governance strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{ruggedness}} {{and relatively}} unspoilt {{nature of the}} Scottish coastline is a major tourist attraction that contributes significantly to both national and local economies. Excursions to view wildlife in natural surroundings are increasingly popular. <b>Marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> in Scotland generated revenues of some £ 57 million and provided around 2, 670 full-time jobs in 1996 (Masters, 1998). Whale-watching may account for up to 12 % of local tourism revenue (Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, 2001). Education and raising public awareness can be added benefits. Nevertheless, wildlife tourism remains, for the most part, underdeveloped.

Ireland has a lot of similarities in terms of species diversity and environmental conditions with Scotland. A number of studies have quantified the volume and value of wildlife tourism in Scotland and identified key areas for development. The Scottish Tourism and Environment Initiative co-funded with the Scottish Natural Heritage a study to assess the economic value of <b>marine</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (Anon, 1998).
