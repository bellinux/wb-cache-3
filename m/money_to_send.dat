5|$|After some {{statements}} made by NBC's Entertainment head Ben Silverman {{about the future of}} the show and the fact that everything seemed to point that Friday Night Lights wouldn't return after the writers' strike, fans put together several campaigns. Save FNL Campaign raised <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> footballs and contributions to charity foundations that were related to the show. The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas.|$|E
5|$|By 1938 PahWongso {{had married}} {{and opened a}} school for poor children, {{particularly}} those of mixed Chinese descent, in Gang Patikee; it was funded by donations. He was {{also a member of}} the Indies branch of the Red Cross, and recognized for his humanitarian work. He organised night fairs in various cities in the Indies (including in Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surabaya), holding auctions and selling drinks and snacks in order to raise <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> aid to China, then fighting against the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children had the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> their children to private school and preferred to do so.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age {{at a time}} when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, Charles went to {{read with}} a Mr. Preston near Cambridge, {{but his father}} was not wealthy and had {{difficulty}} finding the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him to Cambridge University, or to establish him in a profession.

25|$|Ban's first {{overseas}} posting was to New Delhi, India, {{where he}} served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the United States, because in India {{he would be able}} to save more <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> to his family. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991). After Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.|$|E

25|$|By early August 1693, {{the four}} {{warships}} were sailing down the River Thames {{en route to}} Spain's northern city of Corunna. The journey to Corunna should have taken two weeks, {{but for some reason}} the ships did not arrive in Spain until five months later. Worse still, the necessary legal documents had apparently failed to arrive from Madrid, so the ships were forced to wait. As months passed and the documents still did not arrive, the sailors found themselves in an unenviable position: with no <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> home to support their families and unable to find alternate sources of employment, they had become virtual prisoners in Corunna.|$|E
25|$|Blind Brook High School {{opened its}} doors {{in the fall of}} 1973. The {{construction}} of the Blind Brook School District's first high school came about after the community (which was the unincorporated area of the Town of Rye at the time) wanted to expand the local school district, District #5. This push for expansion started after the community became frustrated about spending lots of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> their children to local high schools including Port Chester, Mamaroneck, Rye Neck, and Valhalla, without commensurate representation or influence on those districts' policies and programs. In addition, the Ridge Street School, which housed classes from kindergarten to 8th/9th grades, was becoming overcrowded and could not accommodate the growing population that would become known as Rye Brook (in 1982). Land was purchased on King Street, and construction was started in 1972 and ended in late 1973, months into the school year. The high school today stands on the same campus as in 1973.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the final}} steps for a {{periphery}} country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens. Raising the literacy rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves {{and the rest of}} the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough it is entirely possible for a periphery country to rise to core country status and become a leader in the global market. Another way in which periphery countries better their education system is by spending <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> university level students and staff abroad to places such as the U.S. and Europe to receive better education.|$|E

25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; they rolled bandages, knitted socks, mitts, sweaters, and scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic feeling to Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days for these women consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E
500|$|On 5 May 1911 (Cinco de Mayo), {{a revolutionary}} leader, a {{bricklayer}} or stonemason named Jesús C.

[...] He concluded by demanding that all people of Chinese origin be expelled from Mexico.

500|$|Spurred by the {{persecution}} endured by his followers and himself, in 1792 Toulmin published an anonymous pamphlet entitled [...] "Thoughts on Emigration", containing {{his thoughts on}} members of the Dissenter movement relocating to another country. The following year, his congregants raised enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him to the United States to explore the possibility of relocating there. Dr. Priestly gave him letters of introduction to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to present on his arrival. During his two-month voyage from England to Norfolk, Virginia, Toulmin kept a diary, which was later published under the title The Western Country in 1793; Reports on Kentucky and Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the medical}} bills rose, so did her family's resentment of her. Her brother, Maurice, blamed her {{for what he}} saw as his second-rate education, because there was no <b>money</b> left <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him <b>to</b> public school. She became engaged to a schoolteacher, Charles Buckle, in 1914, but Buckle's mother was {{apparently}} unhappy about it. Haigh-Wood's health problems persuaded Rose Haigh-Wood that her daughter was suffering from [...] "moral insanity." [...] She decided that Haigh-Wood should not marry or bear children, and withdrew the family's consent to the marriage.|$|R

That would be very natural, wouldn't it? Well, Captain Wegg had {{spent a good deal}} of the money, and couldn't pay it all back; so Ethel's grandfather, being his friend, offered to makeup the balance himself rather than see his friend go to prison. That accounts for the disappearance of all the money." ...|$|R

500|$|On June 3, Biden {{participated in}} the second Democratic Debate {{featured}} on CNN, and set in the first primary state of New Hampshire. Biden discussed the War in Iraq, his recent vote to continue the funding of the troops and briefly about illegal immigration. On immigration Biden stated that it would cost too much <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> all 14 million illegal immigrants back to their native countries. He stated that those who commit crimes should be sent back and the rest {{should be given a}} pathway to citizenship. His statement: [...] "Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical." [...] drew some laughter from the audience. Later in the debate Biden addressed his opposition to the [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy of the military and touched on the situation in Darfur.|$|E
500|$|Although {{his mother}} was a Jehovah's Witness, Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic. He {{attended}} mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences. Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required. In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his brachial artery. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result. Five months after the incident, the community raised <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba. It was there that Fleury met Graham James, who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL). [...] James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.|$|E

5000|$|When the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{was at its}} peak, people paid {{heavily to}} make sure they would be remembered. Their {{obsession}} of a [...] "schöne Leiche" [...] (a beautiful corpse) prompted them <b>to</b> save <b>money</b> <b>to</b> ensure their <b>send</b> off was as grand as possible.
