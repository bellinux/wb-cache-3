2500|$|The OFC {{has been}} divided by {{structure}} and connections into a medial and a lateral part. The medial part is most strongly connected [...] with the hippocampus and associated {{areas of the}} cingulate, retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices, anterior thalamus and septal diagonal band. The lateral part can be further subdivided into three sectors. The most caudal sector is characterized by strong connections with the amygdala, midline thalamus, non-isocortical insula and temporal pole. The most anterior sector has more pronounced connections with the granular insula, association cortex, <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus,</b> inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral PFC.|$|E
50|$|If hypofrontality is, in fact, {{caused by}} these inefficient {{synaptic}} connections, then the associated irregular dopaminergic activity {{in certain parts}} of the brain (the limbic striatum and <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus)</b> can be, in part, explained. Dopaminergic activity is the release (or lack thereof) of the neurotransmitter dopamine and the resulting cellular responses. The limbic striatum and <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (parts of the brain) have connections with a part of the prefrontal cortex called the corticolimbothalamic circuit. The corticolimbothalamic circuit has a high concentration of GABAergic interneurons, which are neurons that predominantly work with the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. As a result of the impaired synaptic connections, the GABAergic interneurons of the corticolimbothalamic circuit would adapt to release increasingly high amounts of GABA to send a signal of the correct strength. This recurrent activation of the GABAergic cells produces a strong inhibitory signal back to the limbic striatum and <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus,</b> which inhibits the dopaminergic activity in those parts of the brain. This resulting inhibition of dopaminergic activity produces reduced activity at the mRNA and protein level in cells. These cellular changes could call for less blood flow and glucose use specifically, or the less blood flow and glucose metabolism could simply be a result of the lowered cellular activity.|$|E
50|$|Normally, the dopaminergic neurons {{are only}} phasically active. When they are excited, they fire {{a barrage of}} action {{potentials}} and dopamine is released in the NAC. The medium spiny neurons of the NAC are much more responsive to this increase in dopamine if there is coincident excitatory input from the telencephalic structures such as the amygdala and orbital-medial prefrontal cortex. The activated striatal neurons (NAC neurons) then project to the ventral pallidum, where they inhibit the inhibitory GABA neurons. This inhibition in the pallidum disinhibits the thalamic target of the limbic loop, which is the <b>mediodorsal</b> nucleus. The <b>thalamus</b> then innervates the cortical division of the limbic forebrain. This final connection is reinforced by activity in direct cortical projections from the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA.|$|R
40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{has emerged}} as a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for a number of movement disorders. This has prompted investigation of its use for other applications including psychiatric disorders. In recent years, DBS has been introduced for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts or ideas (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in order to relieve these obsessions (compulsions). Abnormal activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and <b>mediodorsal</b> (MD) <b>thalamus</b> has been implicated in OCD. To this end a number of DBS targets including the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), ventral caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been investigated for the treatment of OCD. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in movement disorders, the mechanism of DBS is not fully understood, especially as it relates to psychiatric disorders. While initially thought to create a functional lesion akin to ablative procedures, it is increasingly clear that DBS may induce clinical benefit through activation of axonal fibers spanning the CSTC circuits, alteration of oscillatory activity within this network, and/or release of critical neurotransmitters. In this article we review how the use of DBS for OCD informs our understanding of both the mechanisms of DBS and the circuitry of OCD. We review the literature on DBS for OCD and discuss potential mechanisms of action at the neuronal level as well as the broader circuit level...|$|R
40|$|Alterations in the {{function}} of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its major thalamic source of innervation, the <b>mediodorsal</b> (MD) <b>thalamus,</b> have been hypothesized to contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. The NMDAR antagonist ketamine, used to model schizophrenia, elicits a brain state resembling early stage schizophrenia characterized by cognitive deficits and increases in cortical low gamma (40 - 70 Hz) power. Here we sought to determine how ketamine differentially affects spiking and gamma local field potential (LFP) activity in the rat mPFC and MD thalamus. Additionally, we investigated the ability of drugs targeting the dopamine D 4 receptor (D 4 R) to modify the effects of ketamine on gamma activity as a measure of potential cognitive therapeutic efficacy. Rats were trained to walk on a treadmill to reduce confounds related to hyperactivity after ketamine administration (10 mg/kg s. c.) while recordings were obtained from electrodes chronically implanted in the mPFC and MD thalamus. Ketamine increased gamma LFP power in mPFC and MD thalamus in a similar frequency range, yet did not increase thalamocortical synchronization. Ketamine also increased firing rates and spike synchronization to gamma oscillations in the mPFC but decreased both measures in MD thalamus. Conversely, walking alone increased both firing rates and spike-gamma LFP correlations in both mPFC and MD thalamus. The D 4 R antagonist alone (L- 745, 870) had no effect on gamma LFP power during treadmill walking, although it reversed increases induced by the D 4 R agonist (A- 412997) in both mPFC and MD thalamus. Neither drug altered ketamine-induced changes in gamma power or firing rates in the mPFC. However, in MD thalamus, the D 4 R agonist increased ketamine-induced gamma power and prevented ketamine's inhibitory effect on firing rates. Results provide new evidence that ketamine differentially modulates spiking and gamma power in MD thalamus and mPFC, supporting a potential role for both areas in contributing to ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms...|$|R

The present study investigated the functional interactions between these regions during performance of a crossmaze [...] based strategy set-shifting task. In Experiment 1, reversible bilateral inactivation of the MD via infusions of bupivacaine did not impair simple discrimination learning, but did disrupt shifting from response to visual cue discrimination strategy, and vice versa. This impairment was due {{to an increase in}} perseverative errors. In Experiment 2, asymmetrical disconnection inactivations of the MD {{on one side of the}} brain and PFC on the other also caused a perseverative deficit when rats were required to shift from a response to a visual cue discrimination strategy, as did disconnections between the PFC and the NAc. However, inactivation of the MD on one side of the brain and the NAc contralaterally resulted in a selective increase in never-reinforced errors, suggesting this pathway is important for eliminating inappropriate strategies during set shifting. These data indicate that set shifting is mediated by a distributed neural circuit, with separate neural pathways contributing dissociable components to this type of behavioral flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{among the}} activities of neural populations in functional regions {{is one of the}} most important electrophysiological phenomena in epileptic brains. The spatiotemporal dynamics of phase synchronization was investigated to reveal the reciprocal interaction between different functional regions during epileptogenesis. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the cornu ammonis 1 of hippocampus (CA 1) and the <b>mediodorsal</b> nucleus of <b>thalamus</b> (MDT) in the mouse amygdala-kindling models during the development of epileptic seizures. The synchronization of LFPs was quantified between BLA, CA 1 and MDT using phase-locking value (PLV). During amygdala kindling, behavioral changes (from stage 0 to stage 5) of mice were accompanied by after-discharges (ADs) of similar waveforms appearing almost simultaneously in CA 1, MDT, as well as BLA. AD durations were positively related to the intensity of seizures. During seizures at stages 1 ~ 2, PLVs remained relatively low and increased dramatically shortly after the termination of the seizures; by contrast, for stages 3 ~ 5, PLVs remained a relatively low level during the initial period but increased dramatically before the seizure termination. And in the theta band, the degree of PLV enhancement was positively associated with seizure intensity. The results suggested that during epileptogenesis, the functional regions were kept desynchronized rather than hyper-synchronized during either the initial or the entire period of the seizures; so different dynamic patterns of phase synchronization may be involved in different periods of the epileptogenesis, and this might also reflect that during seizures at different stages, the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of phase synchronization were different...|$|R

They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an amygdalectomy in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

Preoperatively, monkeys learned object-in-place scene discriminations embedded within colorful visual backgrounds. Unilateral neurotoxic lesions to magnocellular <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MDmc) impaired the ability to learn new object-in-place scene discriminations. In contrast, unilateral ablations to ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex (PFv+o) left learning intact. A second unilateral MDmc or PFv+o lesion in the contralateral hemisphere to the first operation, causing functional MDmc-PFv+o disconnection across hemispheres, further impaired learning object-in-place scene discriminations, although object discrimination learning remained intact. Adaptive decision-making after reward satiety devaluation was also reduced. These data highlight the functional importance of interactions between MDmc and PFv+o during learning object-in-place scene discriminations and adaptive decision-making but not object discrimination learning. Moreover, learning deficits observed after unilateral removal of MDmc but not PFv+o provide direct behavioral evidence of the MDmc role influencing more widespread regions of the frontal lobes in cognition...|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that focal administration of dizocilpine hydrogen maleate (MK- 801, a non-competitive N-methyl-(D) -aspartate antagonist) within the nucleus accumbens increases locomotor activity in a dopamine-independent manner. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the neural network underlying locomotor stimulation induced by N-methyl-(D) -aspartate receptor blockade in the accumbens. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of different doses (1, 5 and 25 nmol) of the active and inactive enantiomers of the N-methyl-(D) -aspartate antagonist. (+) - and (-) -MK- 801, respectively, focally administered in the nucleus accumbens. Only the active enantiomer induced a significant increase in locomotor activity: furthermore, the effect induced by the two highest doses of (+) -MK- 801 was significantly different from that induced by (-) -MK- 801. In the second part of the study, we performed ibotenic acid lesions to the major output nuclei of the accumbens, the ventral pallidum, <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus.</b> ventrolateral/ventromedial thalamus and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. to observe their effect on locomotor activity induced by focal (+) -MK- 801 (35 nmol) administration into the accumbens. None of the lesions had any effect on spontaneous locomotor activity. Hyperactivity induced by accumbens MK- 801 administrations was unaffected by ibotenic acid lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, while lesions of the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> induced only a partial inhibition. In contrast, ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral pallidum and ventrolateral/ventromedial thalamus completely blocked the motor response induced by accumbens MK- 801.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{evidence}} from monkey models of cognition {{shows that the}} magnocellular subdivision of the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MDmc) is more critical for learning new information than for retention of previously acquired information. Further, consistent evidence in animal models shows the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MD) contributes to adaptive decision-making. It is assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial temporal lobes govern these cognitive processes so this evidence suggests that MD contributes a role in these cognitive processes too. Anatomically, the MD has extensive excitatory cortico-thalamo-cortical connections, especially with the PFC. MD also receives modulatory inputs from forebrain, midbrain and brainstem regions. It is suggested that the MD is a higher order thalamic relay of the PFC due to the dual cortico-thalamic inputs from layer V (‘driver’ inputs capable of transmitting a message) and layer VI (‘modulator’ inputs) of the PFC. Thus, the MD thalamic relay may support the transfer of information across the PFC via this indirect thalamic route. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the anatomy of MD as a higher order thalamic relay. It also reviews behavioral and electrophysiological studies in animals to consider how MD might support the transfer of information across the cortex during learning and decision-making. Current evidence suggests the MD is particularly important during rapid trial-by-trial associative learning and decision-making paradigms that involve multiple cognitive processes.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Cognitive inflexibility is a core {{symptom of}} several mental {{disorders}} including schizophrenia. Brain imaging studies in schizophrenia patients performing cognitive tasks have reported decreased {{activation of the}} <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MD). Using a pharmacogenetic approach to model MD hypofunction, we recently showed that decreasing MD activity impairs reversal learning in mice. While this demonstrates causality between MD hypofunction and cognitive inflexibility, questions remain about the elementary cognitive processes that account for the deficit. METHODS: Using the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs system, we reversibly decreased MD activity during behavioral tasks assessing elementary cognitive processes inherent to flexible goal-directed behaviors, including extinction, contingency degradation, outcome devaluation, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (n = 134 mice). RESULTS: While MD hypofunction impaired reversal learning, it {{did not affect the}} ability to learn about nonrewarded cues or the ability to modulate action selection based on the outcome value. In contrast, decreasing MD activity delayed the ability to adapt to changes in the contingency between actions and their outcomes. In addition, while Pavlovian learning was not affected by MD hypofunction, decreasing MD activity during Pavlovian learning impaired the ability of conditioned stimuli to modulate instrumental behavior. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> hypofunction causes cognitive inflexibility reflected by an impaired ability to adapt actions when their consequences change. Furthermore, it alters the encoding of environmental stimuli so that they cannot be properly utilized to guide behavior. Modulating MD activity could be a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting adaptive behavior in human subjects with cognitive inflexibility...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that cognitive control deficits may {{be regarded as}} a connecting link between reported impairments in different cognitive domains of schizophrenia. However, the precise interplay within the fronto-cingulo-thalamic network known to be involved in cognitive control processes and its structural correlates has only been sparsely investigated in schizophrenia. The present multimodal study was therefore designed to model cognitive control processes within the fronto-cingulo-thalamic network. A disruption in effective connectivity in patients in association with abnormal white matter (WM) structure in this network was hypothesized. 36 patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy subjects participated in the present study. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) a Stroop task was applied in an event-related design. For modeling effective connectivity dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was employed to study WM abnormalities. In the fMRI analysis, the patients demonstrated a significantly decreased BOLD signal in the fronto-cingulo-thalamic network. In the DCM analysis, a significantly decreased bilateral endogenous connectivity between the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MD) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was detected in patients in comparison to healthy controls, which was negatively correlated with the Stroop interference score. Furthermore, an increased endogenous connectivity between the right DLPFC and the right MD was observed in the patients.

We show that LYNX 2 can bind to and modulate neuronal nicotinic receptors, and that loss of Lynx 2 alters the actions of nicotine on glutamatergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex. Our data identify Lynx 2 as {{an important component of}} the molecular mechanisms that control anxiety, and suggest that altered glutamatergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex of Lynx 2 mutant mice contributes to increased anxiety-related behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Altered perceptual and {{emotional}} processing might bind impaired cognitive mechanisms during aging; however {{the nature of}} these sensory perception modifications is still unknown. In the present experiment we analyzed in rats, from early to mature life (2 to 11 months old), the response to unattended auditory evoked stimulation (Auditory evoked potential, AEP) and the power spectrum of spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), with the aim of unraveling the onset and target functional effects of aging. Somatosensory and cingulate cortex, <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> and CA 3 hippocampus were chosen for examination based on their involvement in sensory processing and age-related deficits. The main finding of this study is the early onset of age-related changes in adult rats as can be established with both AEP's and frequency analyses, and its diversity between brain regions during normal aging...|$|E
40|$|Limbic motor {{seizures}} in animals, {{analogous to}} complex partial seizures in humans, {{result in a}} consistent activation of the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MD) and, with prolonged seizures, damage to MD. This study examined the functional role of MD in focally evoked limbic motor seizures in the rat. GABA- and glutamate (Glu) -mediated synaptic transmissions in MD were evaluated for an influence on seizures evoked from area tempestas (AT), a discrete epileptogenic site in the rostral piriform cortex. A GABA A receptor agonist, Glu receptor antagonists, or a GABA-elevating agent were focally microinfused into MD before evoking seizures by focal application of bicuculline methiodide into the ipsilateral AT. Focal pretreatment of MD with the GABA A agonist muscimol (190 pmol) protected against seizures evoked from AT. Seizure protection was also obtained with th...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a serious}} and chronic brain {{disorder}} whose underlying neuropathology has proven difficult to identify. This article reviews {{the current status of}} neuropathological studies in terms of how they inform the diagnosis, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of treatment of schizophrenia. Although additional studies are required, substantial data converge on the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is associated with alterations in thalamic-prefrontal cortical connectivity. NEUROSCIENTIST 6 (3) : 208 – 218, 2000 KEY WORDS Schizophrenia, Prefrontal cortex, <b>Mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus,</b> Dopamine, GABA, Pyramidal neuron Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder charac-terized by psychotic symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations), impairments in a spectrum of cognitive abilities that affect the form of thought and the expres-sion of emotion, and deterioration from the previous level of functioning in work, social relations, and self-care (1).

40|$|SummaryPerception of {{the smell}} of a food precedes its {{ingestion}} and perception of its flavor. The neurobiological underpinnings of this association are not well understood. Of central interest is whether the same neural circuits code for anticipatory and consummatory phases. Here, we show that the amygdala and <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> respond preferentially to food odors that predict immediate arrival of their associated drink (FO+) compared to food odors that predict delivery of a tasteless solution (FO−) and compared to the receipt of the drink. In contrast, the left insula/operculum responds preferentially to the drink, whereas the right insula/operculum and left orbitofrontal cortex respond to FO+ and drink. These findings indicate separable and overlapping representation of anticipatory and consummatory chemosensation. Moreover, since ratings of perceived pleasantness of FO+, FO−, and drink were similar, the response in the amygdala and thalamus cannot reflect acquired affective value but rather predictive meaning or biological relevance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MD) shares {{reciprocal}} connectivity {{with the}} prefrontal cortex (PFC), and decreased MD–PFC connectivity is observed in schizophrenia patients. Patients also display cognitive deficits including impairments in working memory, but a mechanistic link between thalamo–prefrontal circuit function and working memory is missing. Using pathway-specific inhibition, we found directional interactions between mouse MD and medial PFC (mPFC), with MD-to-mPFC supporting working memory maintenance and mPFC-to-MD supporting subsequent choice. We further identify mPFC neurons that display elevated spiking during the delay, {{a feature that}} was absent on error trials and required MD inputs for sustained maintenance. Strikingly, delay-tuned neurons had minimal overlap with spatially tuned neurons, and each mPFC population exhibited mutually exclusive dependence on MD and hippocampal inputs. These findings indicate a role for MD in sustaining prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance. Consistent with this idea, we found that enhancing MD excitability was sufficient to enhance task performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWorking {{memory has}} long been {{associated}} with the prefrontal cortex, since damage to this brain area can critically impair the ability to maintain and update mnemonic information. Anatomical and physiological evidence suggests, however, that the prefrontal cortex is part of a broader network of interconnected brain areas involved in working memory. These include the parietal and temporal association areas of the cerebral cortex, cingulate and limbic areas, and subcortical structures such as the <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the basal ganglia. Neurophysiological studies in primates confirm the involvement of areas beyond the frontal lobe and illustrate that working memory involves parallel, distributed neuronal networks. In this article, we review the current understanding of the anatomical organization of networks mediating working memory and the neural correlates of memory manifested in each of their nodes. The neural mechanisms of memory maintenance and the integrative role of the prefrontal cortex are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{decision-making}} uses information gained when exploring alternative {{options to}} decide whether to update the current choice strategy. Magnocellular <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus</b> (MDmc) supports adaptive decision-making, but its causal contribution is not well understood. Monkeys with excitotoxic MDmc damage were tested on probabilistic three-choice decision-making tasks. They could learn and track the changing values in object-reward associations, but they were severely impaired at updating choices after reversals in reward contingencies or when there were multiple options associated with reward. These deficits were not caused by perseveration or insensitivity to negative feedback though. Instead, monkeys with MDmc lesions exhibited an inability to use reward to promote choice repetition after switching to an alternative option due to a diminished influence of recent past choices and the last outcome to guide future behavior. Together, these data suggest MDmc allows for the rapid discovery and persistence with rewarding options, particularly in uncertain or changing environments...|$|E
40|$|Cirrhosis is {{a common}} disease in Western countries. Liver failure, hyperammonemia, and portal {{hypertension}} are the main {{factors that contribute to}} human cirrhosis that frequently leads to a neuropsychiatric disorder known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In this study, we examined the differential contribution of these leading factors to the oxidative metabolism of diverse brain limbic system regions frequently involved in memory process by histochemical labelling of cytochrome oxidase (COx). We have analyzed cortical structures such as the infralimbic and prelimbic cotices, subcortical structures such as hippocampus and ventral striatum, at thalamic level like the anterodorsal, anteroventral, and <b>mediodorsal</b> <b>thalamus,</b> and, finally, the hypothalamus, where the mammillary nuclei (medial and lateral) were measured. The severest alteration is found in the model that mimics intoxication by ammonia, followed by the thioacetamide-treated group and the portal hypertension group. No changes were found at the mammillary bodies for any of the experimental groups...|$|E
