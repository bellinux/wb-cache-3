Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E

Firehouse 35 on Pier 22½ has seven men on duty at all times: four to serve Engine #35, and three dedicated to the two fireboats. All seven are able to man the fireboats in an emergency. As many as ten <b>men</b> <b>can</b> work Phoenix, but in October 1989 after Engine #35 was called to duty, only three were available: Pilot Arvid Havneras, Engineer Nate Hardy, and Lieutenant Bob Banchero. Both fireboat pilot and engineer are licensed by the US Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted <b>men</b> <b>can</b> be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
