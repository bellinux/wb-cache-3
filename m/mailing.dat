For PPI <b>mail</b> this involves either a simple rubber stamp and an ink pad, or a printed label. For franked <b>mail,</b> a dedicated franking machine is used.|$|R

40|$|Wide {{spread of}} spam <b>mails</b> {{is one of}} the most serious {{problems}} on e-mail environment. Particularly, spam <b>mails</b> with a spoofed sender address should not be left alone, since they make the <b>mail</b> server corresponding to the spoofed address be overloaded with massive error <b>mails</b> generated by the spam <b>mails,</b> and since they waste a lot of network and computer resources. In this paper, we propose a protection method of the <b>mail</b> server against such massive error <b>mails.</b> This method introduces an additional <b>mail</b> server that mainly deals with the error <b>mails</b> in order to reduce the load of the original <b>mail</b> server. This method also provide a function that refuses error <b>mails</b> to these two <b>mail</b> servers to save the network and computer resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Intranet <b>mail</b> {{system allows}} {{members of an}} {{organization}} to send or receive <b>mails</b> among them. But the sender don’t know whether the sent <b>mail</b> is viewed by the receiver in time or not, the response for the <b>mail</b> in the receiver side and so on, unless he receive a <b>mail</b> or message personally from the receiver. So this Self Acknowledgeable Intranet <b>Mail</b> System has been designed and implemented to benefit the sender {{about the status of}} his <b>mail.</b> Once a <b>mail</b> is sent, the sender can know the receiver activity in the <b>mail</b> system until the <b>mail</b> is viewed...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} sorting process, <b>mail</b> is {{collected}} from pillar boxes, Post Office branches and businesses, and brought to the local <b>mail</b> centre. The process {{is divided into two}} parts. The 'outward' sorting, identifies <b>mail</b> for delivery in the <b>mail</b> centre geographic area, which is retained and <b>mail</b> intended for other <b>mail</b> centres, which is dispatched. The 'inward' sorting forwards this <b>mail</b> to the relevant delivery offices within the <b>mail</b> centre area. The geographic area of the <b>mail</b> centre corresponds to one or more postcode areas.|$|R

The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially Zelda, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. The <b>mailing</b> list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the Nintendo Power magazine.|$|E

5000|$|By 1995, 20,000 {{advertisements}} {{were being}} published weekly. In 1995 Junk <b>Mail</b> Gauteng split up into two regions, one for Johannesburg {{and the other}} for Pretoria. This was a success because Junk <b>Mail</b> is a community-driven paper, and splitting the original Junk <b>Mail</b> Gauteng into two regions led to more copies being sold and more advertisements being placed. The Motor <b>Mail</b> supplement for the Junk <b>Mail</b> publication was launched in the same year. In 1996 Junk <b>Mail</b> launched its publication for KwaZulu Natal. This meant that Junk <b>Mail</b> could now extend its distribution network beyond Gauteng's borders. In 1997 Junk <b>Mail</b> Publishing launced the world's first job classified free advertising paper, Job <b>Mail,</b> published fortnightly. Job <b>Mail</b> is the only independent publication of its kind in South Africa (and weekly since late 2006). In 1998 Junk <b>Mail</b> Online was launched. Junk <b>Mail</b> Online {{was one of the first}} commercial websites in South Africa. Junk <b>Mail</b> Online is one of the top 10 visited websites in South Africa. After considering and re-evaluating all aspects of the Junk <b>Mail</b> publications for six months, redesigned Junk <b>Mail</b> publications were launched in January 2001. Junk <b>Mail</b> Publishing also introduced an option to place advertisements via SMS in 2002.|$|R
