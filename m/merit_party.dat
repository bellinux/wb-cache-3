40|$|In {{this article}} the {{historical}} and legal experience related to the activities of magistrates' courts in the Russian Empire. Author analyzed features of civil cases in magistrates' courts. Problems of global {{justice of the peace}} development are connected with the formation of the civil society prerequisites, development of public relations. Nature of the magistrate court activity was determined by that it was a lowest judicial instance and in this instance considered the least significant cases, including civil-law claims with small amounts. Passage of civil case in magistrate's court (first instance) can be divided into several stages: initiation of proceedings; preparing case for trial; trial; decision and announcement of the decision; revocable production; decision execution. In the trial stage several stages can be allocated: preparatory part, consideration of <b>merits,</b> <b>parties</b> concluding arguments. Among the important features of proceedings in the magistrates' court should be pointed out the fact that the Charter of Civil Procedure prescribed a detailed written statement of each decision of the judges with a detailed description of all circumstances, including verbal requests and complaints, as well as testimony. As a result, a significant portion of time was taken from the judge by the written work. In the article it is concluded that consideration of civil cases by the magistrate courts can be attributed to civil proceedings, as it was regulated by the Charter of Civil Procedure. Hearing of civil cases in the magistrates' courts had its own characteristics in comparison to the general civil proceedings. These include simplified, compared to the conventional, order of legal proceedings and division of decision on final and inconclusive...|$|R

50|$|In {{coming to}} a {{conclusion}} about the actual rule of law that future courts will use to evaluate employers' actions, the Supreme Court evaluated the <b>merits</b> of each <b>party's</b> claim {{as to what the}} law should be. The plaintiff argued that under the PDA clause at issue, pregnant women should be given an accommodation whenever the employer gives other workers of a similar ability an accommodation. Conversely, the defendant argued that the PDA clause does nothing more than make pregnancy a form of sex discrimination. Since the plaintiff did not fit into any of its neutral categories acceptable accommodation-seekers, the defendant argued, she did not receive the treatment she sought but was not discriminated against on the basis of sex (importantly, the two lower courts had sided with the defendant's argument).|$|R

If the State or municipality meets its burden of proof, the assessed penalties may include a fine, demerit points or suspension of a driver license or fish & wildlife license, and community service.|$|R
5000|$|Non-binding {{arbitration}} {{is a type}} of arbitration {{in which}} the arbitrator makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute, but this determination is not binding upon them, and no enforceable arbitration award is issued. The [...] "award" [...] is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator's view of the respective <b>merits</b> of the <b>parties</b> cases. Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement. The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is, on the surface, similar to that of a mediator in a mediation. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at, the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable.|$|R

5000|$|The {{principle}} of lis alibi pendens (Latin for [...] "dispute elsewhere pending") applies both in municipal law, public international law, and {{private international law}} {{to address the problem}} of potentially contradictory judgments. If two courts were to hear the same dispute, it is possible they would reach inconsistent decisions. To avoid the problem, there are two rules. Res judicata provides that once a case has been determined, it produces a judgment either inter partes or in rem depending on the subject matter of the dispute, i.e. although there can be an appeal on the <b>merits,</b> neither <b>party</b> can recommence proceedings on the same set of facts in another court. If this rule were not in place, litigation might never come to an end. The second rule is that proceedings on the same facts cannot be commenced in a second court if the lis i.e. action, is already pendens, i.e. pending, in another court. Lis alibi pendens arises from international comity and it permits a court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction when there is parallel litigation pending in another jurisdiction. Shany (2003) considers the problem within the public international law field where, for example, the Southern Bluefin Tuna dispute could have been determined either by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or by tribunals established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the Swordfish dispute, which was submitted simultaneously to both the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and a dispute settlement panel of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Kwak and Marceau (2002) consider the jurisdiction between the dispute settlement mechanisms of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and that of the WTO.|$|R

The Taoists expected that their texts would survive. This did not happen as all the texts of Taoists were burnt and that of the Buddhists from the west survived. With this test, the Emperor was convinced of the Buddhist religion. He with all his entourage of ministers and kinsmen embraced Buddhism. He built several temples, which included 'Pai-masai', the White Horse Temple and three convents for nuns. The two Taoist priests who had challenged Buddhism were put to death by fire.|$|R
40|$|Many believe {{intellectual}} property has overreached, and that policymakers must respond. In this Essay, I {{argue that the}} critique may have <b>merit,</b> but private <b>parties</b> are in some cases taking {{matters into their own}} hands. Firms and individuals are increasingly injecting information into the public domain with the explicit goal of preempting or undermining the potential property rights of economic adversaries. Biotechnology firms invest millions of dollars in public domain gene sequence databases, to prevent hold-ups by firms with patents on short gene sequences. Major software firms fight entrenched rivals by investing millions of dollars, contributing to open source operating systems. In both cases, property-preempting investments (PPIs) are made to offset the effects of competitors 2 ̆ 7 property rights. Individuals and nonprofits are joining in too, with initiatives such as the Creative Commons project. All of these major private investments in the public domain reveal a self-correcting feature of the {{intellectual property}} system that has been overlooked until now, and signal that public lawmaking is not the only arena in which the excesses of intellectual property may be addressed...|$|R
60|$|In 1870, {{the time}} arrived when Mr. Gladstone himself, {{no longer a}} {{minister}} third in standing in a Palmerston government, was called upon {{to deal with this}} great issue as a principal in his own administration. In 1868 the conservative government had agreed to a convention, by which a mixed commission, British and American, sitting in London should decide upon the settlement of all claims by the subjects of either country upon the other; and in respect of what were known generically as the Alabama Claims, proposing to refer these to the arbitration of the head of some friendly state, in case the mixed commission should not agree. The idea of a composite court or tribunal, as distinguished from a single sovereign arbitrator, had not yet risen above the horizon. Before this project ripened, Mr. Disraeli was out of government, Lord Clarendon had taken Lord Stanley’s place at the foreign office, and the convention, with some modifications, was signed by him (Jan. 14, 1869), and in due course despatched to Washington. There the Senate, not on the <b>merits</b> but for <b>party</b> and personal reasons, refused to ratify. Though this attempt failed, neither of the two English political parties was in a position any longer to refuse arbitration in principle.|$|R

As to his <b>merits,</b> however, all <b>parties</b> were agreed; the bench, as Thomas Fuller quaintly wrote before the Restoration, seeming 'sick with long longing for his sitting thereon.' Roger North admits that he was 'the best old book lawyer of his time.' Clarendon speaks of his 'eminent parts,' 'great learning,' and 'signal reputation.' Anthony A Wood praises his 'great reading and knowledge in the more profound and perplexed parts of the law,' and his devotion to 'his mother the university of Oxon.' As a politician, his moderation and consistency were generally recognised, though {{for his part in}} the impeachments of Strafford and Stafford he was savagely attacked by Roscommon in his Ghost of the late House of Commons (1680-1). Though hardly eloquent, Maynard was a singularly facile and fluent speaker (Roscommon sneers at 'his accumulative hackney tongue' and could sometimes be crushing in retort. Jeffreys once taxing him in open court with having forgotten his law, he is said to have replied : 'In that case I must have forgotten a great deal more than your lordship ever knew.' He humorously defined advocacy as ars bablativa.|$|R
40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{damaging}} external impediment to a lawyer’s ability to render effective assistance to a client may come from the interference by the trial judge in counsel’s advocacy. A judge supervises the conduct of a trial but he {{is more than a}} mere umpire or moderator. A trial judge, by his rulings, questions, and comments, has an enormous capacity to affect the <b>merits</b> of a <b>party’s</b> case and thereby influence the verdict of the jury. To be sure, the basic requirement of a trial judge, both legally and ethically, is to be impartial in demeanor as well as in actions. However, some judges deviate from this precept of neutrality, and through inadvertence or willfulness, engage in conduct that subverts a lawyer’s ability to effectively defend his client. A judge has broad discretion to administer a trial and supervise the flow of the evidence and the conduct of the attorneys. However, this broad discretion does not authorize a judge to improperly impede defense counsel’s representation in ways that destroy a defendant’s right to a fair trial and the effective assistance of his attorney. When a trial judge improperly interferes with counsel’s representation, {{to the extent that the}} defendant suffers substantial prejudice, an appellate court may conclude that a defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated and the conviction will be reversed...|$|R
40|$|Democratisation and {{decentralisation}} in Indonesia {{have brought}} {{significant changes in}} local politics, especially concerning elections. Since the enactment of Law 32 / 2004 on Local Government, the local executive elections in Indonesia, which were previously done by the local councils, {{have been carried out}} directly by the people. People have been given the opportunity to exercise their right to determine their leaders at the local level. Likewise, political parties have seized the opportunity to participate in local elections by recruiting candidates and mobilising voters. The direct local government election has become a central element in Indonesia’s decentralisation policy. Through the election, the local people are encouraged to participate in choosing their leaders and passing judgment on government’s performance. However, there is far less research and writing on local elections than on national elections, both in Indonesia and in developing countries more generally. This thesis aims to make a contribution to filling this gap in the literature on local election by in-depth case study research on electoral mobilisation undertaken by political parties in the local government elections in Indonesia. The research examines in detail the ways in which political parties in an Indonesian city, Manado, go about mobilising citizens to vote for their candidate and seeks different actors’ views on the effectiveness on the various mobilisation techniques. This research uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the 2010 local government election in Manado City. These methods include in-depth interviewing of the local leaders of political parties, the heads of campaign teams, the candidates, the personnel of the local electoral organisations, the representatives of non-government organisations (NGOs) which monitored the election, mass media personnel, and selected voters in the local community. Local newspapers were also consulted to follow the mobilisation undertaken by political parties in the Manado local election. In addition, direct observation had been done during the 2010 local government election in Manado City. The main findings include a diversity of opinion on the effectiveness of mobilisation strategies. Also, voters tend to choose candidates on personal <b>merits</b> not <b>party</b> affiliation but parties are essential for mobilising voters...|$|R

I may even boast right reverend authority on the same score; for more than one nonjuring bishop, whose authority and income were upon as apostolical a scale as the greatest abominator of Episcopacy could well desire, have deigned, while partaking of the humble cheer of the Wallace Inn, to furnish me with information corrective of the facts which I learned from others.

All which, as it may be matter of some humiliation to the wise and mighty of this world, so the effects thereof may, perhaps, in time, prove very different from what, I hope in charity, were ever foreseen or intended.|$|R

5000|$|Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov {{insists that}} both the February demonstrations and the {{subsequent}} anti-Oresharski ones remained relatively ineffective due to the lacking political leadership in their ranks. Also, from a utilitarian standpoint, a very limited number of the protester demands {{are believed to have}} been achieved seven months after Borisov's resignation - 17 out of 20 issues raised by the protesters are thought not to have been tackled in full or in part by the relevant political actors. Antoniy Galabov maintains that while the initial demonstrations were against high utility bills, with the implicit hope that Borisov could rectify the situation, the protests were subsequently taken over by new participants with a different profile, often driven by corporate interests. The demonstrators' demands are believed to have become overly abstract, with the finger being pointed at the whole political system {{and the nature of the}} democratic transition; this is thought to have essentially forced all the mainstream parties to incorporate populism into their platforms in order to portray themselves as allies of the people on the streets. Political scientist Deyan Kyuranov regards the initial preeminence of economic grievances as a particular strength of the protest, but believes that the protesters were ill-advised to attempt change the focal point in the direction of a political demonstration and thus caused the collapse of what started off as a promising popular movement. A number of analysts have also subscribed to the viewpoint that the accusations levelled against GERB (for its supposed authoritarianism and violation of democratic norms) have been without sufficient <b>merit</b> and the <b>party</b> was not even close to creating a state within a state during Borisov's time in power. According to a report generated by the [...] "Media Democracy" [...] foundation, the general coverage of the demonstrations by the major media outlets (even those previously considered to be favourable to the Borisov administration) was almost universally pro-protest, with the main media's nature of reporting turning markedly against the government on 17 February. Despite the calls for greater accountability in politics during the course of the protests, leadership hierarchies and inner party consensus within BSP and GERB are believed to have become more entrenched in the months following the end of the demonstrations, with the status quo parties never facing a serious challenge as a result of the demonstrations. The Internet is believed to have played an important role when it comes to many aspects of the protest movement.|$|R

Although the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Amchem has engendered some confusion over the continued viability of mass tort settlement class actions, it appears that such settlements remain a dominant approach to resolving mass tort lawsuits. With increasing frequency, plaintiffs and defendants come to court holding hands, and courts must launch their own vigorous inquiries into the <b>merits</b> of the <b>parties</b> 2 ̆ 7 proffered settlement. In the world of mass tort litigation, at least, we have sneaked away from the traditional U. S. adversarial model of justice, and towards the inquisitorial model common in the civil law countries of continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, Latin America. We have turned toward inquisitorial justice not by design, but by necessity and ad hoc innovation. In {{what appears to be}} a moment of significance in the episodic evolution of the adjudicatory process, some judges have turned to devices that, despite short-term resistance, may gain widespread acceptance with time. Using a comparative perspective, this article examines two salutary trends in modem mass tort litigation: the use of court-appointed scientific experts and the use of settlement class actions with a vigorous inquiry into the merits of the settlement. Part I looks at court-appointed scientific experts, noting the growing use of such experts in mass tort cases, despite most judges 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to use such experts. Part II addresses settlement class actions, which offer an appealing path out of the morass of inefficient and inconsistent mass tort litigation, but which raise troubling fairness issues, and thus should be permitted only if the court vigorously inquires into the merits of the settlement. Part III examines the similarities between these judicial devices and the inquisitorial justice model, then considers the barriers of judicial culture and structure that hinder U. S. judges from making regular and effective use of such inquisitorial tools. Although court-appointed experts and well-scrutinized settlement class actions can help courts reach just and efficient mass tort resolutions, their inquisitorial nature renders widespread and effective adoption in this country unlikely in the short term. Nevertheless, these recent trends in mass tort litigation may hint at an evolution toward greater use of inquisitorial tools within the context of the U. S. adversary system. Thus, while Part IV considers the possibility of legislative solutions to mass torts, it concludes with skepticism regarding the prospect of congressional intervention in this arena, and with hope that courts may adapt to make more effective use of less familiar approaches...|$|R
6000|$|All {{human race}} would fain be wits, And {{millions}} miss {{for one that}} hits. Young's universal passion, pride,[1] Was never known to spread so wide. Say, Britain, could you ever boast Three poets in an age at most? Our chilling climate hardly bears A sprig of bays in fifty years; While every fool his claim alleges, As if it grew in common hedges. What reason can there be assign'd For this perverseness in the mind? Brutes find out where their talents lie: A bear {{will not attempt to}} fly; A founder'd horse will oft debate, Before he tries a five-barr'd gate; A dog by instinct turns aside, Who sees the ditch too deep and wide. But man we find the only creature Who, led by Folly, combats Nature; Who, when she loudly cries, Forbear, With obstinacy fixes there; And, where his genius least inclines, Absurdly bends his whole designs. [...] Not empire to the rising sun By valour, conduct, fortune won; Not highest wisdom in debates, For framing laws to govern states; Not skill in sciences profound So large to grasp the circle round, Such heavenly influence require, As how to strike the Muse's lyre. [...] Not beggar's brat on bulk begot; Not bastard of a pedler Scot; Not boy brought up to cleaning shoes, The spawn of Bridewell[2] or the stews; Not infants dropp'd, the spurious pledges Of gipsies litter'd under hedges; Are so disqualified by fate To rise in church, or law, or state, As he whom Phoebus in his ire Has blasted with poetic fire. What hope of custom in the fair, While not a soul demands your ware? Where you have nothing to produce For private life, or public use? Court, city, country, want you not; You cannot bribe, betray, or plot. For poets, law makes no provision; The wealthy have you in derision: Of state affairs you cannot smatter; Are awkward when you try to flatter; Your portion, taking Britain round, Was just one annual hundred pound; Now not so much as in remainder, Since Cibber[3] brought in an attainder; For ever fix'd by right divine (A monarch's right) on Grub Street line. [...] Poor starv'ling bard, how small thy gains! How unproportion'd to thy pains! And here a simile comes pat in: Though chickens take a month to fatten, The guests in less than half an hour Will more than half a score devour. So, after toiling twenty days To earn a stock of pence and praise, Thy labours, grown the critic's prey, Are swallow'd o'er a dish of tea; Gone to be never heard of more, Gone where the chickens went before. How shall a new attempter learn Of different spirits to discern, And how distinguish which is which, The poet's vein, or scribbling itch? Then hear an old experienced sinner, Instructing thus a young beginner. [...] Consult yourself; and if you find A powerful impulse urge your mind, Impartial judge within your breast What subject you can manage best; Whether your genius most inclines To satire, praise, or humorous lines, To elegies in mournful tone, Or prologue sent from hand unknown. Then, rising with Aurora's light, The Muse invoked, sit down to write; Blot out, correct, insert, refine, Enlarge, diminish, interline; Be mindful, when invention fails, To scratch your head, and bite your nails. [...] Your poem finish'd, next your care Is needful to transcribe it fair. In modern wit all printed trash is Set off with numerous breaks and dashes. [...] To statesmen would you give a wipe, You print it in Italic type. When letters are in vulgar shapes, 'Tis ten to one the wit escapes: But, when in capitals express'd, The dullest reader smokes the jest: Or else perhaps he may invent A better than the poet meant; As learned commentators view In Homer more than Homer knew. [...] Your poem in its modish dress, Correctly fitted for the press, Convey by penny-post to Lintot,[4] But let no friend alive look into't. If Lintot thinks 'twill quit the cost, You need not fear your labour lost: And how agreeably surprised Are you to see it advertised! The hawker shows you one in print, As fresh as farthings from the mint: The product of your toil and sweating; A bastard of your own begetting. [...] Be sure at Will's,[5] the following day, Lie snug, and hear what critics say; And, if you find the general vogue Pronounces you a stupid rogue, Damns all your thoughts as low and little, Sit still, and swallow down your spittle; Be silent as a politician, For talking may beget suspicion; Or praise the judgment of the town, And help yourself to run it down. Give up your fond paternal pride, Nor argue on the weaker side: For, poems read without a name We justly praise, or justly blame; And critics have no partial views, Except they know whom they abuse: And since you ne'er provoke their spite, Depend upon't their judgment's right. But if you blab, you are undone: Consider what a risk you run: You lose your credit all at once; The town will mark you for a dunce; The vilest dogg'rel Grub Street sends, Will pass for yours with foes and friends; And you must bear the whole disgrace, Till some fresh blockhead takes your place. [...] Your secret kept, your poem sunk, And sent in quires to line a trunk, If still you be disposed to rhyme, Go try your hand a second time. Again you fail: yet Safe's the word; Take courage and attempt a third. But first with care employ your thoughts Where critics mark'd your former faults; The trivial turns, the borrow'd wit, The similes that nothing fit; The cant which every fool repeats, Town jests and coffeehouse conceits, Descriptions tedious, flat, and dry, And introduced the Lord knows why: Or where we find your fury set Against the harmless alphabet; On A's and B's your malice vent, While readers wonder whom you meant: A public or a private robber, A statesman, or a South Sea jobber; A prelate, who no God believes; A parliament, or den of thieves; A pickpurse at the bar or bench, A duchess, or a suburb wench: Or oft, when epithets you link, In gaping lines to fill a chink; Like stepping-stones, to save a stride, In streets where kennels are too wide; Or like a heel-piece, to support A cripple with one foot too short; Or like a bridge, that joins a marish To moorlands of a different parish. So have I seen ill-coupled hounds Drag different ways in miry grounds. So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er unhabitable downs Place elephants for want of towns. [...] But, though you miss your third essay, You need not throw your pen away. Lay now aside all thoughts of fame, To spring more profitable game. From <b>party</b> <b>merit</b> seek support; The vilest verse thrives best at court. And may you ever have the luck To rhyme almost as ill as Duck;[6] And, though you never learn'd to scan verse Come out with some lampoon on D'Anvers. A pamphlet in Sir Bob's defence Will never fail to bring in pence: Nor be concern'd about the sale, He pays his workmen on the nail.[7] Display the blessings of the nation, And praise the whole administration. Extol the bench of bishops round, Who at them rail, bid ---- confound; To bishop-haters answer thus: (The only logic used by us) What though they don't believe in ---- Deny them Protestants--thou lyest. [...] A prince, the moment he is crown'd, Inherits every virtue round, As emblems of the sovereign power, Like other baubles in the Tower; Is generous, valiant, just, and wise, And so continues till he dies: His humble senate this professes, In all their speeches, votes, addresses. But once you fix him in a tomb, His virtues fade, his vices bloom; And each perfection, wrong imputed, Is fully at his death confuted. The loads of poems in his praise, Ascending, make one funeral blaze: His panegyrics then are ceased, He grows a tyrant, dunce, or beast. As soon as you can hear his knell, This god on earth turns devil in hell: And lo! his ministers of state, Transform'd to imps, his levee wait; Where in the scenes of endless woe, They ply their former arts below; And as they sail in Charon's boat, Contrive to bribe the judge's vote; To Cerberus they give a sop, His triple barking mouth to stop; Or, in the ivory gate of dreams,[8] Project excise and South-Sea[9] schemes; Or hire their party pamphleteers To set Elysium by the ears. [...] Then, poet, if you mean to thrive, Employ your muse on kings alive; With prudence gathering up a cluster Of all the virtues you can muster, Which, form'd into a garland sweet, Lay humbly at your monarch's feet: Who, as the odours reach his throne, Will smile, and think them all his own; For law and gospel both determine All virtues lodge in royal ermine: I mean the oracles of both, Who shall depose it upon oath. Your garland, in the following reign, Change but the names, will do again. [...] But, if you think this trade too base, (Which seldom is the dunce's case) Put on the critic's brow, and sit At Will's, the puny judge of wit. A nod, a shrug, a scornful smile, With caution used, may serve a while. Proceed no further in your part, Before you learn the terms of art; For you can never be too far gone In all our modern critics' jargon: Then talk with more authentic face Of unities, in time and place: Get scraps of Horace from your friends, And have them at your fingers' ends; Learn Aristotle's rules by rote, And at all hazards boldly quote; Judicious Rymer[10] oft review, Wise Dennis,[11] and profound Bossu.[12] Read all the prefaces of Dryden, For these our critics much confide in; Though merely writ at first for filling, To raise the volume's price a shilling. [...] A forward critic often dupes us With sham quotations peri hupsous: And if we have not read Longinus, Will magisterially outshine us. Then, lest with Greek he overrun ye, Procure the book for love or money, Translated from Boileau's translation,[13] And quote quotation on quotation. [...] At Will's you hear a poem read, Where Battus[14] from the table head, Reclining on his elbow-chair, Gives judgment with decisive air; To whom the tribe of circling wits As to an oracle submits. He gives directions to the town, To cry it up, or run it down; Like courtiers, when they|$|R
