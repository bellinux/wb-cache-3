In doing so, he attempts to provide lawmakers 			and policymakers with demographic information and sociological perspectives on 			undocumented immigrants. As such, he 			presents information on the racialization of undocumented immigrants (the 			assumption that all undocumented immigrants are Mexican), the guest worker 			program, employer recruiting efforts that can constitute a de facto guest 			worker program, {{and the use of}} undocumented immigrants in the meatpacking 			industry. He concludes that comprehensive 			immigration reform should take such demographic information and sociological 			perspectives into account to ensure that U.

5000|$|Despite the {{announcement}} in his inauguration from then, President Manuel Zelaya, that his government would invest 1% {{of the general}} budget in the protection of natural resources, water remained absent from that promise. The manager of SANAA, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jorge</b> Mendez, speaking at the U.S. Embassy on the management of water and sanitation stated that, [...] "Honduras has moved rather poorly on the issue." [...] Going on, Mr. Mendez asserted that Honduras is well behind in achieving the objectives set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS). He urged his country to give {{the same level of}} importance to water supply challenges that is given to sanitation and that the two issues need to be worked on in parallel or neither challenge would be met. Mr. Mendez is hoping to see water resources management and water supply and sanitation become depoliticized and not used as an enterprising commodity.|$|R

40|$|Aligned {{with the}} goals of the Mexican National Development Plan, the state of Jalisco, one of the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico, is rapidly developing. In order to {{maintain}} a proper management of public debt, the government of Jalisco has sought a viable instrument to promote economic growth by generating infrastructure that have a direct impact and that benefit the population. In this paper, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jorge</b> Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz, Governor of the State of Jalisco, describes the significant adjustments that his government implemented aiming at restructuring state finances and strengthening austerity measures in public spending in order to allocate the resources to prioritizing actions {{for the benefit of the}} citizens. In particular, he focuses on the local government's commitment to give new impetus to investment in infrastructural projects thanks to the sectoral Program called "Movilidad Sustentable" (Sustainable Mobility). This Program looks at the interaction of the public transport with the other actors of mobility (pedestrians, cyclists and car drivers) and sets a model for reorganization and improvement. More concretely, the plan for the "Extension and Modernization of Light Rail Line 1 of Guadalajara" is part of this Program and serves as the case study that Mr Sandoval Díaz uses to explain the idea that public funding can be a trigger for economic development, as long as it is responsibly administered...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three months we have studied the ion {{exchange}} behavior of the zeolites, converted from fly ash in more detail. In particular, the ion-exchange isotherms of the treated fly ash containing zeolite Y with Cs+ ions were studied. For comparison, the ion exchange isotherms of synthetic zeolite Y and commercial zeolite A were also studied. These results showed that the background materials in the fly ash do not affect the ion exchange performance of the zeolites that the fly ash contains. It is also found that a higher total ion concentration (Na+ plus Cs+) in the solutions results in a higher amount of ions exchanged with the zeolites. The ion exchange of treated fly ash with Co{sup 2 +} ions was studied as well. This part of the research was done by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jorge</b> Moller who was hired starting April 3 for 6 months as a co-op student. In an attempt to broaden the applications of fly ash, investigation into the formation of mesoporous materials from fly ash was initiated. Mesoporous materials were discovered three years ago by scientists at Mobil and have been under active research by many researchers since then. Mesoporous materials have large surface areas with variable pore sizes in the range of > 20 angstroms. Potential applications of mesoporous materials include catalysts, absorbents, molecular sieves, etc. If mesoporous materials can be converted from fly ash, it will open up another area of applications for fly ash...|$|R

Clair Saddath of Time listed the video amongst the best of all time. The video was nominated for Video of the Year at the BET Awards of 2011, and West was nominated for Director of the Year. As of January 2015, Billboard named the video as one of the 20 best of the 2010s (so far).|$|R
40|$|Defense Date: 11 / 10 / 2010 Examining Board: Prof. Jacques Ziller, University of Pavia (EUI Supervisor) Prof. Pippo Ranci, Catholic University of Milan Prof. Leigh Hancher, University of Tilburg <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jorge</b> Vasconcelos, MIT/Portugal Programme, Lisbon UniversityThe European Union (EU) {{has set the}} {{objective}} to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy. The development of a European energy policy is constantly emphasised in the declarations of EU political leaders. This thesis provides {{an assessment of the}} legal feasibility of an EU energy policy in the areas of industrial restructuring, institutional reform and security of supply. The first chapter looks into the Endesa saga, which offers a paradigmatic case concerning the tensions between energy champions and energy markets. Successive national and ‘foreign’ takeover bids for Endesa are examined at national and EU level by different authorities according to different legal regimes, which show the ambivalent contribution of the merger control to the development of an energy policy. The persistence of monopolistic structures despite energy liberalisation requires the reinforcement of the role of regulatory authorities, as analysed in chapter two. However, one cannot expect that national regulatory authorities and the newly created European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators enjoy the same powers and level of independence as their integration within Member States and the EU operates on the basis of different legal and institutional principles. Chapter three addresses security of energy supply, which is in principle a responsibility of the Member States (which often used it as a pretext to promote national champions), but it has also a European dimension in terms of external dependence and solidarity. The absence of a specific legal basis on energy in the treaties has not prevented the EU from dealing with security of supply by having recourse to legal bases in the fields of environmental policy, crisis management and trans-European networks. A more coherent approach to energy policy is expected with the new legal basis on energy in the Lisbon Treaty. Beyond future developments, this thesis measures the integrity of the commitment repeatedly expressed by European Heads of Governments and States to build up a European energy policy...|$|R
