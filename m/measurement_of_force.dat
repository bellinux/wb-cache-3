Relevant articles were defined as those that described the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> applied during spinal mobilization or discussed the reliability <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> manual <b>forces.</b> Results: Twenty studies described the quantitative <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> applied <b>force</b> during a PA mobilization technique, with most focusing on the lumbar spine. When defined by magnitude, frequency, amplitude, and displacement, PA mobilization forces are extremely variable among clinicians applying the same manual technique. Variability may be attributed to differences in techniques, measurement or reporting procedures, or variations between therapists or between patients. Conclusions: The inconsistency in manual force application during PA spinal mobilization in existing studies suggests that further studies are needed to improve the clinical standardization <b>of</b> manual <b>force</b> application. Future research on mobilization should include forces applied to the cervical and thoracic spines in addition to the lumbar spine while thoroughly describing force parameters and measurement methods to facilitate comparison between studies...|$|R

The force sensing is performed by detecting the bending-loss induced fringe contrast changes, while the Bragg wavelength shift is employed for temperature measurement. Sensitivities of 9.8 pm/°C and 0.025 dB/μN were obtained experimentally for temperature and force measurements, respectively.|$|E
