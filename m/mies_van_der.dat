5|$|Expressionist {{architecture}} {{developed in}} the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger, Erich Mendelsohn, Dominikus Böhm, and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it {{is the home of}} Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. Ludwig <b>Mies</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper. Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Hans Kollhoff, Sergei Tchoban, KK Architekten, Helmut Jahn, Behnisch, GMP, Ole Scheeren, J. Mayer H., OM Ungers, Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto (the last two being Pritzker Prize winners).|$|E
5|$|After the 1940s, the Gothic style {{on campus}} began {{to give way}} to modern styles. In 1955, Eero Saarinen was {{contracted}} to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen); a series of arts buildings; a building designed by Ludwig <b>Mies</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Rohe for the university's School of Social Service Administration, a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone, and the Regenstein Library, the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations. In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.|$|E

5|$|Pei {{finally saw}} his {{architecture}} {{come to life}} in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained {{as part of an}} apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of <b>Mies</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.|$|E

30|$|Starting {{from the}} Oligocene the phases which have {{determined}} the present-day {{configuration of the}} western Mediterranean reflect a progressive migration of the Adriatic-Ionian lithosphere {{in the frame of}} a complex subduction system, migrating westwards (Malinverno and Ryan 1986; Figure  2). From the end of the Oligocene {{and the beginning of the}} Miocene (about 26 My B.P.) the extensional phases, to the west of the trench in the back-arc area, have produced a rifting of the Ercinian crust of the European foreland, which has given origin to the opening of the Ligurian-Provenzal Ocean, with a counterclockwise rotation of about 25 °- 30 ° of the Sardinia-Corsica block, happened from 30 and 16 <b>My</b> B.P. (<b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Voo 1993). During this period the first compressional phases of the Apenninic orogenesis verified, during which the more internal tectonic units moved eastwards overlying the outermost ones. In the Early-Middle Tortonian (about 12 My B.P.) another compressional tectonic phase verified, during which the uplift of part of the central Apennines happened.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} interpret the statements of Ludwig <b>Mies</b> <b>vans</b> <b>der</b> Rohe (1886 - 1969) that pertain to his lifelong theory of Baukunst, or the art of building in terms of tectonics. In order to use the concept tectonics as a criterion according to which one can comprehend Mies words and works, this dissertation attempted to define tectonics in {{a more general sense}} by collecting existing definitions and categorizing them. The result of this endeavor showed that tectonics does not signify a supportive structure but the art of framing construction, in which linear elements are put together with joints and clad or infilled with lightweight material. It is proposed that Mies, who called the ideal of tectonic architecture the art of building, during his lifelong career, experienced two periods of critical awareness through which he established his own type of tectonic buildings: awareness of the open plan and then that of clear space. After the former occurred in 1926, he focused on the creation of inner spatial openness; after the latter, which this dissertation proposes occurred around 1930, when he met Karlfried Graf Drckheim (1896 - 1988), who had been absorbed in Lao-tzus philosophy, Mies intended to show that his architectural concern was beyond physical construction by employing the concept of changing nature and by designing his buildings to be neutral frames. Mies finally achieved a tectonically integrated body of a building that contained extroverted and undetermined space, which he referred to as clear space, or generally called Mies universal space, through his lifelong pursuit for the accomplishment of his own art of building, which this dissertation terms Miesian tectonics.
