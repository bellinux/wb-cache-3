The objective function is found to be complex, and more than one optimal design point may exist with different numbers of plies. Existing methods based on evolutionary algorithms tend to become trapped around a local optimum and can find no more than one optimal result per calculation. Aiming at the characteristics of the objective function, an improved evolutionary algorithm (INDE for short) is established based on niching technology. The formula for calculating the distance between individuals in the niching technology is improved to satisfy the minimum weight design for the composite <b>laminated</b> <b>tube.</b> As a result, the improved niching evolutionary algorithm offers better global search ability and can find more than one optimal result per calculation for different numbers of plies...|$|R

40|$|Filament-wound, fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix {{composite}} <b>laminate</b> <b>tubes</b> {{have been}} used {{for a wide range of}} engineering applications, owing to their high specific stiffness, strength and superior corrosion resistance. Leakage failure of composite tubes under multiaxial loading has been an important design concern. Extensive analytical and experimental investigations have recently been reported on leakage failure of composite tubes. These investigations developed deterministic estimates of leakage failure for different combinations of axial load and internal pressure. Effects of uncertainties in material properties and laminate construction on leakage failure need to be studied in detail. In this study; probabilistic analyses are performed to predict first-ply failure of angle-ply composite <b>laminate</b> <b>tubes</b> under combined internal pressure and axial loading. Randomness is considered in (1) elastic moduli along principal lamina directions; (2) uniaxial matrix-dominated strengths of each lamina; and (3) local thickness variation of individual plies. The probabilistic finite element analysis is performed using the ANSYSTM program and Latin hypercube sampling. Influence of each basic variable on first-ply failure is evaluated.

40|$|This paper shows {{theoretical}} models (analytical formulations) {{to predict the}} mechanical behavior of thick composite tubes and how some parameters can influence this behavior.

One of the potential applications of composites is helicopter landing gears. Helicopter landing gears consist of straight and curved tubes. A new analysis and design tool is required to consider the manufacturing technology. In this study, high-order analytical methods are proposed to analyze and design thick laminated orthotropic straight and curved tubes subjected to different boundary and loading conditions. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the elasticity displacement field of thick <b>laminated</b> composite straight <b>tubes</b> is developed. In this investigation, thick composite cantilever tubes under transverse loading are studied using the newly displacement-based method. This method provides a quick, convenient and accurate procedure for the determination of 3 D stresses in thick composite straight tubes subjected to both bending and shear loadings. In addition, this method is used to study stress and strain distributions in thick composite straight tubes with different simple and complex lay-up sequences. Note that thick <b>laminated</b> composite straight <b>tubes</b> subjected to cantilever loading conditions are investigated for the first time. Moreover, the developed method is used to analyze thick <b>laminated</b> composite straight <b>tubes</b> subjected to different mechanical loadings such as axial force, torque and bending moment. In the second part of this thesis, the general displacement field of thick <b>laminated</b> composite curved <b>tubes</b> is developed. By proposing a new high-order displacement-based method, single-layer composite curved tubes are examined. First, a displacement approach of Toroidal Elasticity is chosen to obtain the displacement field of single-layer composite curved tubes. Then, a layer-wise method is employed to develop the most general displacement field of elasticity for thick arbitrary <b>laminated</b> composite curved <b>tubes.</b> The developed method is used to analyze single-layer and <b>laminated</b> composite curved <b>tubes</b> subjected to pure bending moment. Note that displacement-based Toroidal Elasticity is applied to study thick <b>laminated</b> composite curved <b>tubes</b> for the first time. In addition, the failure analysis on thick composite curved tubes subjected to pure bending moment is conducted. Effects of lay-up sequences of composite curved tubes on stress distributions and failure sequences are investigated, as well. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the numerical results obtained using the proposed methods against finite element method, experimental data and solutions available in the literature. The methods that proposed in this thesis do not require meshing. They simplify greatly inputs that the user has to do, once the program for solution is available. This presents a clear advantage over FEM. Therefore, the most important advantage of the proposed methods is that inputs for modeling and analyzing of composite straight and curved tubes with complex lay-up sequences are simple, easy to use and fast to run. In addition, using FEM for the parametric study is cumbersome. By applying the proposed methods, the parametric study for thick laminated composite straight and curved tubes is simple with low computational cost...|$|R

But realizing this goal has not been easy; the difficulties of generating manufacturing information directly from computer aided design (CAD) data continued to challenge researchers for over 25 years. Although the extraction of coordinate geometry has always been straightforward, identifying the semantic structures (i. e., features) needed for reasoning about a component's function and manufacturability has proved much more difficult. Consequently the programming of computer controlled manufacturing processes such as milling, cutting, turning and even the various lamination systems (e. g., SLA, SLS) has remained largely computer aided rather than entirely automated.
