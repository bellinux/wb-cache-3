[...] For ships subject to the International Convention on Load Lines, the Summer Load Line draft is used, with the exception of cases where that is a timber load line. [...] For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision load line assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. [...] Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a load line by its national government, the draft for that summer load line is used. [...] If the ship has no load line, instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. [...] Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the <b>moulded</b> <b>depth</b> amidships.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1925, CNR {{completed}} its branch line from Kamloops to Kelowna. It built a transfer slip at Kelowna and started boat service on Okanagan Lake with the twin-screw Pentowna. Pentowna was prefabricated at the Prince Rupert Dry Dock yards, and then broken apart {{and shipped to}} Kelowna. There, 65 experienced shipbuilders from Dumbarton, Scotland reassembled the boat {{under the supervision of}} CNR officials and its future skipper, Captain Roe. Pentowna was of modern design, with a steel hull and twin diesel engines. The absence of boilers and heat greatly improved the handling of perishable fruits, and officials ensured that speed, accommodation, and the buffet service were up to the highest standards in Canada. Pentowna was the first diesel-powered ship on the lake, with the finest and most up-to-date engines possible made by Gardner and Company in Manchester, England. The keel was laid on 13 May 1926.

40|$|Mould slag {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} the steel quality if the fluid flow in the mould is not {{properly}} controlled. The fluid flow in the twin-slab casting mould {{and its effect on}} mould slag entrainment were studied using a full scale water model. Velocity field in the upper mould was measured by means of laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) under various conditions. The parameters studied were <b>mould</b> width, immersion <b>depth</b> of submerged entry nozzle (SEN), and SEN port clogging. Uneven SEN port clogging was found to have a great effect on the mould fluid flow and thus mould slag entrainment. A new SEN with double tapered ports was designed to overcome SEN port clogging and erosion. Plant trial results showed that a decrease in the buildup rate in the bore of the SEN immediately above and in the ports can be achieved using the new SEN design. This has resulted in an increase in tonnes per SEN and a corresponding decrease in SEN consumption...|$|R
6000|$|Sufficient {{evidence}} {{has now been}} given showing that small objects left {{on the surface of}} the land where worms abound soon get buried, and that large stones sink slowly downwards through the same means. [...] Every step of the process could be followed, from the accidental deposition of a single casting on a small object lying loose on the surface, to its being entangled amidst the matted roots of the turf, and lastly to its being embedded in the <b>mould</b> at various <b>depths</b> beneath the surface. When the same field was re-examined after the interval of a few years, such objects were found at a greater depth than before. The straightness and regularity of the lines formed by the imbedded objects, and their parallelism with the surface of the land, are the most striking features of the case; for this parallelism shows how equably the worms must have worked; the result being, however, partly the effect of the washing down of the fresh castings by rain. The specific gravity of the objects does not affect their rate of sinking, as could be seen by porous cinders, burnt marl, chalk and quartz pebbles, having all sunk to the same depth within the same time. Considering the nature of the substratum, which at Leith Hill Place was sandy soil including many bits of rock, and at Stonehenge, chalk-rubble with broken flints; considering, also, the presence of the turf-covered sloping border of mould round the great fragments of stone at both these places, their sinking does not appear to have been sensibly aided by their weight, though this was considerable. {50} ...|$|R
