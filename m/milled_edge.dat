40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the edge sealing and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> and fog seal methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|R

"Debasement" [...] is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the tendency of silver or gold coins to be [...] "shaved", that is, to have small amounts shaved off the edges of the coins by unscrupulous users, thereby reducing the actual silver content of the coin. In order to prevent this, silver and gold coins began to be produced with <b>milled</b> <b>edges,</b> as many coins still do by tradition, although they no longer contain valuable metals. For example, the U.S. quarter and dime have <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> Coins that have traditionally been made purely of base metals, such as the U.S. nickel or the penny, {{are more likely to have}} unmilled edges.|$|R

25|$|The 1p, 2p, 20p and 50p coins have smooth edges. The 5p, 10p, £1 and £2 coins have <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> The <b>milling,</b> in {{combination}} with the non-circular shape of the 20p and 50p, serve as the primary means of identification and differentiation between coinage for blind or visually impaired people. Historically, milling also served to discourage coin clipping.|$|R
50|$|The main {{techniques}} of coin <b>edging</b> are <b>edge</b> <b>mills</b> of various types, which put a pattern on a smooth edge after a coin and coin <b>mills</b> with <b>edge</b> ring, which pattern the edge {{at the time}} when the coin is being milled.|$|R

25|$|English {{currency}} was {{in disarray}} {{in the late}} 17th century. Hand-struck silver coins from prior to 1662 had been clipped around the edges and thus their value (weight) reduced so that {{they were no longer}} a viable tender, especially abroad. The machine-struck silver coins produced by the Royal Mint in the Tower of London after 1662 were protected from clipping by an engraved, decorated and <b>milled</b> <b>edge,</b> but were instead forged, both by casting from counterfeit moulds and by die stamping from counterfeit dies. By 1696 forged coins constituted about 10% of the nation's currency. The currency also had a third problem: its value as silver bullion in Paris and Amsterdam was greater than the face value in London. Thus vast quantities of coins were melted and shipped abroad— an arbitrage market. New Acts of Parliament were passed in order to create the Bank of England and protect national military security. This situation also prompted William Lowndes of the Treasury to ask Isaac Newton for help.|$|E

50|$|Spanish laws of 1728 and 1730 adopted modern minting techniques. Coins {{were to be}} minted with technologically {{advanced}} equipment {{so that they would}} be perfectly round and have <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> There was a simultaneous reduction in weight and fineness, the peso becoming 27.064 g, 0.916⅔ fine (24.809 g fine silver). This is the coin that became known in the British colonies as the Spanish milled dollar.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{roughness}} of longitudinal milled birch wood samples {{as a function}} of main milling regimes such as <b>milling</b> tool <b>edge</b> blunt radius ρ (10 µm ÷ 40 µm), feed rate of milling tool uz (0. 5 mm ÷ 2. 0 mm) and milling tool cutting speed v (22. 4 m/s ÷ 40. 8 m/s) were investigated. The test bench with required testing regimes was created on the basis of planning machine and by imitation <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> radius blunt. The qualitative analysis of milled wood surface was performed according to the results of optical microscopy. For quantitative analysis parameter Rmmax was calculated. It was accepted as a difference between highest and lowest values of obtained surface irregularities in optical microphotographs of samples cross-sections. It was obtained that the decrease of both <b>milling</b> tool <b>edge</b> blunt radius and feed rate during milling, decreases the {{surface roughness}} and the quality of surface processing increases. The increase of milling tool radial velocity leads on to the increase of surface processing quality, also. That leads on decrease of energy consumption, too...|$|R
2500|$|In the 12th century a new {{standard}} for English coinage was established by Henry II — the Sterling Silver standard of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. This was a harder-wearing alloy, yet {{it was still a}} rather high grade of silver. It went some way towards discouraging the practice of [...] "clipping", though this practice was further discouraged and largely eliminated with the introduction of the <b>milled</b> <b>edge</b> we see on coins today.|$|E
2500|$|The current clad {{version is}} {{two layers of}} cupronickel, 75% copper and 25% nickel, on a core of pure copper. The total {{composition}} of the coin is 8.33% nickel, with the remainder copper. It weighs 0.2000 avoirdupois oz, 1/80th of a pound, 0.1823troy oz, (5.670grams). The diameter is 0.955inches (24.26mm), and the width of 0.069 inches (1.75mm). The coin has a 0.069-inch (1.75-mm) reeded (or <b>milled)</b> <b>edge.</b> Owing {{to the introduction of}} the clad quarter in 1965, it was occasionally called a [...] "Johnson Sandwich" [...] after Lyndon B. Johnson, the U.S. President at the time. As of 2011, it cost 11.14 cents to produce each coin. The U.S. Mint began producing silver quarters again in 1992 for inclusion in the annual Silver Proof set. Early quarters (before 1828) were slightly larger in diameter and thinner than the current coin.|$|E
2500|$|Dollar coins {{have not}} been very popular in the United States. [...] Silver dollars were minted {{intermittently}} from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their <b>milled</b> <b>edge,</b> and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain legal tender. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a new $1 coin, featuring Sacagawea, (the Sacagawea dollar) was introduced, which corrected {{some of the problems}} of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the columnario, Spanish coins were hammer struck. These rather crude looking coins {{were called}} cobs. Clipping {{was a problem}} with cobs as it was easy to shave small amounts of silver from their edges, and {{although}} this action was punishable by death, it was still a widespread occurrence. The columnario, unlike the odd-shaped cob, is a round coin with <b>milled</b> <b>edges</b> which makes clipping detectable and less likely to occur.|$|R

The 5 and 10 francs have continuous <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> Second types of the 1 and 5 franc coins were introduced in 1976, featuring the coat of arms. In 2011 new 10 and 50 franc coins were introduced. In 2015 a 100 franc coin was introduced to replace the 100 franc banknote.|$|R
