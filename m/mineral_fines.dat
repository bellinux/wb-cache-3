By inductively coupled plasma (ICP), zeta potentials analyzer, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) testing means, we can analyse soluble ions, surface charge, surface groups and surface morphology of albite. The results were listed as followes: Staphylococcus aureus could promote the dissolution of albite, and promote the soluble Si, Al and Fe ions; Staphylococcus aureus would adsorb on albite surface, gave its some characteristics to albite, changed surface charge, and made the zeta potential move in the positive direction.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis revealed the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the bioflocculant, and thermal characterization by differential scanning calorimetly (DSC) showed the transition and crystalline melting point at 90 - 105 degrees C. The effects of bioflocculant dosage and pH on the flocculation of mineral suspensions were evaluated. The bioflocculant exhibited good flocculating capability on mineral suspensions and achieved flocculating efficiencies of 90 percent for k-aolinite and 85 percent for hematite suspensions at a dosage of only 5 mL/L. The maximum arsenite removal was found to be 90 percent at a bioflocculant dosage of 2 g/L, which is better than traditional chemicalflocculants.

40|$|Cleanup of oil spills, {{especially}} at the shoreline, is confronted with challenging problems of both technology and cost-effectiveness. Over the past decades, a new hypothesis has emerged, that the formation of Oil-Mineral Aggregates (OMAs) consisting of oil droplets and <b>mineral</b> <b>fines,</b> enhances the dispersion of oil in aquatic environments. Despite its documented role in cleaning oil spills along shorelines through reported experimental studies, {{the literature on the}} mathematical modeling of the formation and dispersion of OMAs has been limited. In the present study, the physical processes were investigated including oil slick breaking up under breaking wave, the formation of OMAs, and oil/OMAs vertical mixing. A modeling approach was developed for simulating the formation and vertical mixing of oil droplets and OMAs, namely Oil Droplet and OMAs Simulation (OMA-SIM). This method integrated modeling tools for addressing the oil vertical mixing model and density based OMAs formation model to examine the dispersion of oil droplets and OMAs. The OMA-SIM was validated using data obtained from mesoscale wave tank experiments. The concentration and size of oil droplets and OMAs generated under breaking wave condition were simulated and compared with experimental data. The main factors that affect oil droplets and OMAs formation and vertical mixing have been studied and concerned in the developed model. These factors include oil density and viscosity, oil/water interfacial tension, wave energy dispersion rate, dispersants, and environment temperature. The results of the case studies suggest that the OMA-SIM developed in this study provide effective methods for simulating and predicting the vertical dispersion of spilled oil. A computation system was then developed that couples the OMA-SIM with a user-friendly interface system, and the system was applied to real case studies based on field data. OMA-SIM results indicated that the energy dissipation rate of breaking waves is the predominant factor which affects the concentration and particle size of oil droplets and OMAs. The higher the breaking wave energy, the more oil was dispersed with time after the experimental oil spill. Oil viscosity has a significant influence on dispersed oil concentration. The mass of dispersed oil decreased with increasing oil viscosity. Increasing temperature to decrease oil viscosity and then to enhance the formation of OMAs resulted in a greater concentration of oil. The dispersants reduce oil/water interfacial tension and result in a decreased size of oil droplets and OMAs. The application of <b>mineral</b> <b>fines</b> facilitates the formation of OMAs...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of two bacterial strains namely, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus firmus {{in the production of}} bioflocculants was made. The highest bioflocculant yield of 16. 55 g/L was obtained from B. licheniformis (L) and 10 g/L from B. firmus (F). The bioflocculants obtained from the bacterial species were water soluble and insoluble in organic solvents. FTIR spectral analysis revealed the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl and sugar derivatives in the bioflocculants. Thermal characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the crystalline transition and the melting point (T-m) at 90 - 100 degrees C. Effects of bioflocculant dosage and pH on the flocculation of clay fines were evaluated. Highest bioflocculation efficiency on kaolin clay suspensions was observed at an optimum bioflocculant dosage of 5 g/L. The optimum pH range for the maximum bioflocculation was at pH 7 - 9. Bioflocculants exhibited high efficiency in dye decolorization. The maximum Cr (VI) removal was found to be 85 % for L (bioflocculant dosage at 2 g/L). This study demonstrates that microbial bioflocculants find potential applications in mineral processing such as selective flocculation of <b>mineral</b> <b>fines,</b> decolorization of dye solutions and in the remediation of toxic metal solutions.

40|$|Soils are {{important}} sources of sediment and phosphorus in rural catchments, necessitating {{the development of}} mathematical models for impact assessment. In this paper, multiple empirical models are tested on an event basis at four nested locations in an intensively managed grassland headwater catchment while accounting for parameter and data uncertainties using extended Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE). The study provides the first template of model comparison under data uncertainty in soil erosion and phosphorus transfer modelling as well as hypotheses of soil and water processes in the study catchment. A fodder field, yielding large sediment and phosphorus concentrations in runoff, is characterized by inter-event variation in sediment-discharge relationship, mild intra-event hysteretic behaviour and seemingly random erosion incidents. Sediment-discharge variation is partly formalized by parameter variation {{as a function of}} antecedent soil moisture, indicative of a gradual shift from transport- to source-limited behaviour, decreasing soil erodibility and/or decreasing initial flow erosivity and transport capacity with increasing antecedent wetness. The catchment outlet appears to be source-limited while converging flows with different sediment concentrations, variable erosion processes and/or sporadic entrainment of near- or in-stream sediments gain importance. Phosphorus dynamics are strongly linked to those of sediment. Non-linearities can be explained by preferential transfer of phosphorus-rich organic matter at small flows while there is no significant evidence of preferential transfer of phosphorus-rich <b>mineral</b> <b>fines.</b> Iterating between collecting data, constraining uncertainties and rejecting and improving models is suggested as a consistent framework for understanding soil erosion and phosphorus movement...|$|E

The method uses a single <b>mineral</b> <b>fine</b> SPM component for computational efficiency, with a concentration-dependent settling velocity to parameterize the effect of settling of different size fractions. The SPM is resuspended in response to combined wave and current conditions. Wave conditions were calculated using a simple set of equilibrium equations, which allows computationally cheap inclusion of the large-scale spatial and temporal trends of the wave field. The development was carried out using 1 D water-column implementations of GOTM-ERSEM-BFM for two sites for which multi-year time series observations from autonomous moorings (SmartBuoy) were available.

Further analysis of these key Collie coal density fractions using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) shows that 54. 13  wt% of the total mineral matter in the whole Collie coal are <b>fine</b> <b>mineral</b> particles of sizes < 10  μm.

CCSEM analysis also shows that the key <b>minerals</b> in the <b>fine</b> <b>mineral</b> particles are quartz, kaolinite, K-, Ca- or Fe-Al silicates and pyrite-related minerals.

40|$|Gangue {{minerals}} {{can often}} have severe {{adverse effects on}} selective value mineral separation. Such effects can be mediated {{through a variety of}} pathways or mechanisms. One popular mechanism is that of "slime coating" or heterocoagulation, wherein the gangue <b>mineral</b> <b>fines</b> are believed to coat the value mineral surfaces and thereby reduce selectivity and floatability. Another pathway that has received relatively little attention is that mediated through the effect of gangue minerals on pulp rheology, and consequently selective separation. Our recent work in developing a scientific understanding of these effects has highlighted the prevalence and importance of this pathway. In this study, the impact of shape and morphology of serpentine gangue minerals on suspension rheology and selective Ni flotation from ultramafic ores was investigated. We found strong evidence for microand macro-network formation in the presence of acicular (needle-shaped) or fibrous minerals, which impacted pulp rheological properties. Results also supported the hypothesis that morphology has a greater role to play than mere shape. The size of the network ranged from 5 microns to 2 em depending upon the amount and aspect ratio of fibrous minerals. These networks impede many flotation sub-processes, such as gas dispersion and bubble-particle interactions. Additionally, the small pore size of the networks prevents bubble penetration leading to a large transport of the gangue minerals to the concentrate via lifting of the entire network by bubble flux, which resulted in a significant grade dilution. Based on the scientific insights generated in this study various techniques have been developed to improve selective value mineral separation...|$|E

This study was performed on a low-grade iron ore namely goethitic-lateritic ore (GLO) from Eastern India. Detailed mineralogical, physical and chemical characteristics of a goethitic-lateritic iron ore showed that the sample contained porous and friable oxides and hydroxides of iron. The ore sample had a feed grade of 54. 43 % total Fe, 9. 27 % SiO 2 and 8. 02 % Al 2 O 3. Hematite and goethite are main iron-bearing minerals while kaolinite and gibbsite are the major gangue mineral constituents. Considering the characterization data, these ores were ground separately to three size fractions, namely- 300 μm,- 250 μm and- 150 μm sizes and subjected to flowing film concentration in Wilfley Table. As revealed by the liberation study, higher concentration was obtained by the processing of- 150 μm crushed sample. The grade of the ore was improved from 54. 43 % Fe to 65. 71 % Fe. However, significant amount of fine iron ore particles were lost during the processing of- 150 μm size ore, {{because it is not}} very effective for particles less than 15 μm. Thus, fine hematite and goethite particles are usually not recovered resulting in the loss of valuable iron ore fines. To recover this fine, Multi Gravity Separator was used in place of Wilfley Table and was found to be effective in reducing loss of fine iron particles and increasing the grade of the concentrate. The MGS process improved the Fe from 54. 43 % to 66. 5 % along with decreasing the alumina from 8. 02 % to 1. 17 %...|$|E

Certain other taxa are common in selected habitats, such as cf. Ammatoidea in some pools and Chlainomonas kolii in snow {{on the surface of}} an alpine tarn. Distinct assemblages of algae occur in snow and associated with the moss Andreaea mutabilis. Assemblages in pools, soils, <b>mineral</b> <b>fines,</b> on rock surfaces, and associated with vascular plants are not distinguishable, which may reflect the shortcomings of using presence/absence data as the basis for ordinations. The complete life-cycle of the enigmatic C. kolii is still not understood. This alga has previously been found only in snow beneath forest in North America, where it is generally exposed to much lower light intensity and higher nutrient levels than in alpine New Zealand. However, C. kolii on Mt Philistine grows during prolonged rainstorms, when liquid water content increases, light intensity decreases and freezing at night is absent. Timing of the bloom each year appears {{to be related to the}} amount of snow deposited during the previous winter. Snow algae resting cysts are deposited by retreating snow onto underlying substrata on the site. However, their ultimate fate is unknown. Many algae are lofted and dispersed elsewhere, including onto snow from other habitats. An unidentified snow algal cyst (possibly Chlamydomonas sp.) is a small component of the aerobiota. C. kolii has not been found in these samples. The cyanophytes Fischerella sp. and cf. Gloeocapsa dominate the aerobiota. Collection of air-borne algae illustrates the problem of distinguishing wind-deposited propagules from active algae in a given habitat, especially those organisms requiring cultures for their detection and identification. Temporal variation of cultured organisms from aerobiota suggests that their growth periods are distinct from many of those absent from cultures.
