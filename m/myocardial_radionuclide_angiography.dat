The {{accuracy}} of Fourier analysis of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was assessed versus X-ray right ventricular angiography.

In patients with recurrent right ventricular tachycardia, the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy {{is based on the}} presence of right ventricular wall motion abnormalities on conventional X-ray angiography without evidence of other heart disease. Methods. X-ray and <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> were prospectively compared in 73 patients with ventricular tachycardia. We analyzed the presence of a right ventricular enlargement, global hypokinesia and segmental wall motion abnormalities, using visual analysis for both techniques and Fourier analysis for <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography.</b> Disease was noted as absent or present and as diffuse or localized. The interobserver reproducibility of both techniques for the diagnosis of right ventricular wall motion abnormalities was tested in 27 randomly selected patients. Results. According to X-ray angiography, 53 patients were considered to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (22 diffuse, 31 localized forms) and 20 patients a normal right ventricle. The sensitivity of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> was 94. 3 %, specificity 90 % and positive and negative predictive values 96 % and 85. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{assessed}} {{the agreement of}} left ventricular ejection fraction determinations from two-dimensional echocardiography, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> and contrast cineangiography. Background. Previously published reports suggest that two-dimensional echocardiography, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> and contrast cineangiography are equally acceptable methods of assessing left ventricular ejection fraction {{on the basis of}} high coefficients of correlation. However, correlation of methods does not necessarily imply agreement. Methods. In a prospective analysis, 25 consecutive subjects all had two-dimensional echocardiography and <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> performed within 10 days of each other in the cardiology department of a metropolitan community hospital. A retrospective computer search (Medline) revealed seven studies, using the coefficient of correlation (r), comparing two-dimensional echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (n = 268) with radionuclide angiographic (n = 174) or contrast cineangiographic (n = 119) left ventricular ejection fractions. Results. The eight individual studies (n = 293) comparing two-dimensional echocardiography with either <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> or contrast cineangiography exhibited coefficients of correlation ranging from 0. 78 to 0. 93. Agreement analysis using the method of Bland and Altman was performed by averaging the results obtained from the two techniques and determining how disparate any single ejection fraction was (with 95 % confidence limits) from the mean value. Agreement ranged from 23 % to 42 % around the mean ejection fraction. The average lack of agreement between the two methods for all studies involved was 17 %, with an average r value of 0. 86. Conclusions. Left ventricular ejection fraction determinations by means of two-dimensional echocardiography, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> and contrast cineangiography exhibit high correlation and only moderate agreement. High correlation does not always imply high agreement. These results suggest that, when validated by agreement analysis, multiple studies may not be necessary in appropriate clinical situations, potentially reducing costs...|$|R

In centre 1 the mean difference (SD) in ejection fraction (<b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> [...] echocardiography) was - 8 (10 %); 95 % CI - 12 to - 4 %. In centre 2 the mean difference was - 14 (11 %); 95 % CI - 17 to - 11 %. If patients had been treated with an ACE inhibitor on the basis of a radionuclide ejection fraction of < 40 % then 93 % in centre 1 (28 of 30) and 98 % in centre 2 (39 of 40) would have been treated. This compares with 63 % (19 of 30) and 50 % (20 of 40), respectively if echocardiography had been used as a guide.

Eighty-two % of the patients with coronary artery disease showed an increase of less than 5 units in global ejection fraction during bicycle exercise. However, this criterion resulted in a low specificity of 30 % in the patients with normal coronary arteries.

40|$|AbstractThe disease entity “diabetic cardiomyopathy” {{has been}} {{extensively}} described in young patients with diabetes {{in the absence of}} ischemic, hypertensive or valvular heart disease. The most convincing data have been a 30 % to 40 % incidence of decreased radionuclide angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction response to dynamic exercise. In the current study, the hypothesis was tested that this abnormal ejection fraction response was due to alterations in ventricular loading conditions or cardiac autonomic innervation (extrinsic factors), or both, rather than to abnormalities in intrinsic ventricular systolic fiber function (contractility). Twenty normotensive patients with diabetes (mean age 30 ± 5 years, mean duration 15 ± 6 years) and 20 age-matched normal subjects were studied. All patients with diabetes had a normal treadmill exercise tolerance test without evidence of <b>myocardial</b> ischemia. By <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography,</b> all normal subjects increased ejection fraction with exercise (62 ± 4 % to 69 ± 6 %; p < 0. 001). In contrast, 11 (55 %) of 20 patients with diabetes maintained or increased ejection fraction with exercise (group 1; 62 ± 4 % to 69 ± 6 %; p < 0. 001) and 9 (45 %) of 20 showed an exercise-induced decrease (group 2; 73 ± 4 % to 66 ± 6 %; p < 0. 001). No difference in the incidence of microangiopathy, as noted by funduscopic examination, was present between the diabetic groups. Despite the abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise in the group 2 patients with diabetes, all patients with diabetes had a nor response to afterload manipulation, normal baseline ventricular contractility as assessed by load- and heart rate-independent end-systolic indexes and normal contractile reserve as assessed with dobutamine challenge. Autonomic dysfunction did not explain the disparate results between the group 2 patients' radionuclide angiographic data and their load-independent tests of ventricular contractility and reserve. In addition, the high ejection fraction at rest in group 2 patients (73 ± 4 % versus 62 ± 4 % for normal subjects; p < 0. 001) was not related to the abnormal tests of autonomic function.

Accordingly, the magnitude of inherent variability among sequential measurements of hemodynamic variables assessed by gated <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> was investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion in 39 patients during two placebo periods separated by 6 weeks. All patients analyzed had remained clinically stable during the study period. Although the mean values for all hemodynamic variables between the two placebo periods were minimally changed, the differences in individual patients were striking. Criteria were developed to allow meaningful interpretation of changes in hemodynamic variables by estimating the likelihood that an observed change is due to variability alone. On the basis of this analysis of placebo radionuclide angiographic data, variation due to chance alone is unlikely to account for all variability if a change observed between the two rest gated studies in a patient is ≥ 7 % units for {{left ventricular}} ejection fraction, ≥ 45 ml/m 2 for end-diastolic volume index, ≥ 35 ml/m 2 for end-systolic volume index, ≥ 20 ml/m 2 for stroke volume index and > 1. 25 liters/min per m 2 for cardiac index. An observed 4 % unit change in left ventricular ejection fraction (increase or decrease) after a medical intervention in an individual patient occurs by random variation > 25 % of the time. The criteria presented are applicable to clinical practice because they allow precise interpretation of hemodynamic changes measured by gated <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> in individual patients whether the change is due to altered clinical status or to a medical intervention...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{applications of}} nuclear cardiology have rapidly expanded since {{the introduction of}} suitable imaging cameras and readily applicable isotopes. The currently available methods can provide useful data on estimates of ventricular function and detection of myocardial ischemia for adequate patient management. Two standard procedures are routinely used: (1) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, eg, with thallium 201; and (2) radionuclide angiocardiography by using technetium 99 m-labeled red blood cells. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides information on regional viability and estimates regional myocardial perfusion by measuring regional tracer activity. Thallium 201 is the agent used for noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion and for improving the results of exercise electrocardiography. Alternative tests, such as pharmacologic stress testing with dipyridamole, have been proposed as a reliable substitute for exercise testing. Additional quantitative analysis and computed tomography have increased the sensitivity and specificity of thallium scintigraphy. <b>Radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> techniques are used for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function, right and left ventricular function, and wall motion abnormalities. As in perfusion scintigraphy, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> has proven its value {{for the detection of}} coronary artery disease (CAD).

40|$|Objectives:To study if venous {{thrombectomy}} prevents late post-thrombotic sequelae, venous obstruction reflux, {{and improves}} venous physiology following an acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis. Design:Prospective randomised controlled study. Material:Thirty patients returned for follow-up 10 years after an acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis initially treated with conventional anticoagulation treatment (medical group, n = 17) or with thrombectomy {{combined with a}} temporary arteriovenous fistula and anticoagulation (surgical group, n = 13). Clinical assessment, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography,</b> duplex ultrasound and venous physiology tests were performed. Results:Leg swelling was recorded in 12 (71 %) and leg ulcers in three (18 %) of the medical patients and in, respectively, six (46 %) and one (8 %) of the surgical patients. The surgical patients had less severe sequelae (class 0 – 2). <b>Radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> demonstrated that the iliac vein was more commonly occluded following medical (59 %) than following surgical (17 %) treatment (p< 0. 05). Duplex examination demonstrated slightly (n. s.) more reflux in the femoral and popliteal veins in the medical group. Venous physiology (occlusion plethysmography, foot volumetry, and foot vein pressures) did not show any significant differences, although the medical group tended {{to have a more}} severe pathology. Conclusion:Venous thrombectomy improves venous patency and possibly reduces venous reflux and post-thrombotic sequelae as compared to anticoagulation treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{retrospective}} 5 year {{follow-up study}} {{was performed in}} 140 patients with unequivocal ischemia during exercise <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> (≥ 10 % decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction or ≥ 5 % decrease in ejection fraction together with a distinct regional wall motion abnormality). In 84 patients (60 %), ischemia during <b>radionuclide</b> <b>angiography</b> was silent (silent ischemia group), whereas 56 patients experienced angina during the test (symptomatic group). Work load and antianginal medication were similar in both groups. Critical cardiac events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac death) occurred in 27 % of patients in the silent ischemia group and 16 % {{of those in the}} symptomatic group (p = NS); however, myocardial infarction or death was more frequent in patients with silent ischemia (22 % versus 9 %; p < 0. 05). If there was additional exercise-induced ST segment depression, the rate of critical events was further increased (p < 0. 05). The difference in critical cardiac events seemed to be influenced by the higher incidence of revascularization procedures in symptomatic patients, whereas medical therapy had no similar effect. Thus, these findings suggest that patients with documented severe ischemia should undergo left heart catheterization and revascularization irrespective of symptoms to improve their prognosis...|$|R
