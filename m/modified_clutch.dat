5000|$|BSA were {{concerned}} about that wear in the plunger suspension was leading to uncertain handling. In 1954 the factory adopted a swinging arm, and the hinged mudguard was deleted. In seemingly backwards step, the semi-unit gearbox was abandoned for a separate [...] "pre-unit" [...] item. The new design had a different primary chain adjustment, a <b>modified</b> <b>clutch,</b> and new gearbox internals.|$|E
50|$|The Saab Monster was an {{experimental}} car made by Saab in 1959. This project {{was part of}} Saab's work in motorsport {{and the need to}} derive more power from their two-stroke powerplant. It consisted of a 'Toreador Red' Saab 93 with all excess weight removed, including the bonnet, which was replaced by a plastic one. The engineers then installed two transverse 748 cc two-stroke, three cylinder engines, in a 'split in-line' configuration, driving the front wheels through a <b>modified</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearbox assembly. There were two distributors and an enlarged radiator.|$|E

5000|$|A modern {{draw-works}} {{consists of}} five main parts: the drum, the motor(s), the reduction gear, the brake, and the auxiliary brake. The motors can be AC or DC-motors, or the draw-works may be connected directly to diesel engines using metal chain-like belts. The {{number of gears}} could be one, two or three speed combinations. The main brake, usually operated manually by a long handle, may be friction band brake, a disc brake or a <b>modified</b> <b>clutch.</b> It serves as a parking brake when no motion is desired. The auxiliary brake {{is connected to the}} drum, and absorbs the energy released as heavy loads are lowered. This brake may use eddy current rotors or water-turbine-like apparatus to convert the kinetic energy of the moving load to heat and dissipate it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Clutch mods" [...] - The car builder {{may have}} <b>modified</b> the <b>clutch</b> to {{introduce}} some slip at lower rpm with lever weights {{to lock the}} transmission input shaft to the flywheel speed as the engine reaches a pre-selected optimum (this is done to limit power application at starting line). Also, on drag motorcycles, a typical modification is an air shifter—compressed air is used to instantaneously change gears as the driver presses a thumb button ...|$|R
50|$|The 1981 XL250S was {{the last}} year to have the unique 23-inch front wheel, rear twin shock, and 6-volt {{electrical}} system. It also had upgraded rear brakes in a larger hub and a <b>modified</b> 5 plate <b>clutch,</b> and handsome twin speedo and tacho gauges in the Australian, continental variants. In 1982 the engine had the balancing cam sprocket driven rather than chain making the engine quieter and a six-speed gearbox was introduced with an automatic cam chain tensioner. From 1982 Honda reverted to the 21-inch front wheel and introduced the rear single shock suspension, known as the Pro-Link, and a 12-volt system. The 1984-1987 models were equipped with dual carburetors and the RFVC type of engine.|$|R
40|$|Reproductive skew theory {{seeks to}} {{integrate}} social and ecological factors thought {{to influence the}} division of reproduction among group-living animals. However, most reproductive skew models only examine interactions between individuals of the same sex. Here, we suggest that females can influence group stability and conflict among males by <b>modifying</b> their <b>clutch</b> size and may do so if they benefit from the presence of subordinate male helpers or from reduced conflict. We develop 3 models, based on concessions-based, restraint, and tug-of-war models, in which female clutch size is variable and ask when females will increase their clutch size above that which would be optimal {{in the absence of}} male [...] male conflict. In concessions-based and restraint models, females should increase clutch size above their optima if the benefits of staying for subordinate males are relatively low. Relatedness between males has no effect on clutch size. When females do increase clutch size, the division of reproduction between males is not influenced by relatedness and does not differ between restraint and concessions-based models. Both of these predictions are in sharp contrast to previous models. In tug-of-war models, clutch size is strongly influenced by relatedness between males, with the largest clutches, but the fewest surviving offspring, produced when males are unrelated. These 3 models demonstrate the importance of considering third-party interests in the decisions of group-living organisms. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{synchronous}} machine model and parameters {{can be found}} in the Simulink SimPowerSystems library and follows the model in [13]. The <b>clutch</b> <b>modifies</b> the torque transmitted to the {{synchronous machine}} [6, 8] and the diesel engine speed [8]. When locking the clutch, a maximum speed difference of 10 − 5 is acceptable. Similar to the studies in [6, 7], the diesel engine cranking dynamics are avoided. To avoid the unnecessary diesel engine cranking dynamics, the engine rest state is simulated at a speed of 0.3 p.u. Thus, although the engine is considered stopped, the simulated value would remain at 0.3 p.u. Since the cranking delay will affect the readiness of the DG to provide frequency regulation, a 0.5  s delay is added as cranking time to the DG model [6, 7]. Thus, the diesel engine start will be delayed by 0.5  s when the speed increases from 0.3 p.u.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT drivetrain was augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and steel flywheel in the so-called Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain [1]. This transmission concept managed to combine two contradictive goals: · the driveability {{in terms of the}} pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved; · and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. These goals were achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, enabled by the large ratiocoverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 'peakshaver' during engine speed transients: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal kickdown and absorbs the engine's kinetic energy at pedal back-out. The current paper presents an improved concept with respect to the Zero Inertia drivetrain, which enables a reduced flywheel size while enhancing the pedal-towheel response even further. This concept is designated the Impulse Shift CVT (IS-CVT). The IS-CVT incorporates a slightly <b>modified</b> drive <b>clutch</b> and uses it to interrupt the power flow through the CVT during kickdown accelerations. Disengaging the drive clutch directs the entire engine power flow through the parallel (flywheel and planetary gear) branch, resulting in an immediate flywheel assist while the engine speeds up rapidly. When the engine has reached its desired speed, the drive clutch is re-engaged and the power flow through the CVT is reinstated. The presented IS-CVT concept enables much faster speed transients, independent of the CVT shift rate, resulting in a more effective use of the flywheel energy. Hence the flywheel can be reduced, and the ZI effect can be exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the demands on the variator actuators can be lower. Simulations of the performance of the IS-CVT are presented and compared to those of CVT and ZI equipped vehicles...|$|R
