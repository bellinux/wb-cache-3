40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} {{was used to}} quantify residues of oxolinic acid and flumequine in muscle of wild fish caught {{in the vicinity of}} fish farms using the LiftUp feed collector system or a hydroacoustic feed detector during medication. Both systems are designed to minimise feed waste and thereby the amount of medicated feed entering the surroundings. The result indicates that both systems decrease the supply of <b>medicated</b> <b>pellets</b> to the wild fish during medication, since the mean and maximum concentrations of drugs in muscle of wild fish were reduced compared to fish farms not using this equipment. Therefore, the equipment will reduce the environmental impact of antibacterial agents used in fish farming...|$|E
40|$|Sea bass with {{approximate}} average weights of 5 and 20 g {{were treated}} against Ceratothoa oestroides infection with: (i) <b>medicated</b> <b>pellets</b> of diflubenzuron PC 90 at a dosage of 3 mg kg(- 1) body weight (BW) {{per day for}} 14 days. Lice were counted {{at the beginning of}} treatment and 19 days after treatment. The drug cleared all lice in the treated group; in the control group, infection remained high 30 days after beginning the experiment. It was concluded that <b>medicated</b> <b>pellets</b> containing 3 mg kg(- 1) BW diflubenzuron effectively cleared pre-adult and adult stages of the isopod parasite over a 14 -day period. No adverse effects were recorded in treated sea bass during the trials and no reinfection occurred 15 days after end of the treatment. (ii) Deltamethrin by means of bath treatments in infected sea bass kept in experimental tanks at 20 degreesC. Before treatment, toxicity on healthy fish was preliminarily assessed by testing five fish from each size group at concentrations of 30 10, 5, 3, 1, 0. 1, 0. 05 and 0. 01 mg L- 1 for 30 min. The therapeutic concentrations tested were: 10, 5, 3, 0. 15, 0. 1, and 0. 05 mug L- 1 and assessed at 1, 24 and 48 h. Best results were achieved with the 10 mug L- 1 (0. 01 mg L- 1) dose, where prevalence was reduced from 100 to 0 % over 24 h in both large and small fish. No parasite recovery was observed at 48 h. The dose of 5 mug L- 1 reduced prevalence from 100 to 11. 7 % and to 0 % for small and large fish, respectively. Finally, with the 3 mug L- 1 dose, prevalence was reduced from 100 to 37. 5 % (small fish) and to 13. 3 % (large fish). Lower doses were ineffective on the parasites at either 24 or 48 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of medicated food pellets (containing 10 mg of ivermectin per kg, UNIFEED, Veronesi, Verona, Italy) was evaluated {{for the control}} of intestinal strongyles {{in a group of}} captive zebras (Equus burchelli) at the Safari Park, Fasano (Apulia region, Brindisi Province, southern Italy). The egg reappearance period and the faecal egg counts in terms of eggs per gram of faeces were investigated. From day 0 until day + 9, 30 zebras were fed with <b>medicated</b> <b>pellets</b> and pooled faecal samples were collected from the floor of paddocks. The drug showed an {{efficacy of}} 100 % for up to 78 days post-treatment, with one exception. Strongyle eggs collected prior to the treatment were used to perform coprocultures and larvae harvested were molecularly identified as Cylicostephanus minutus and Cylicocyclus leptostomum with a reverse line blot hybridization assay. The administration of ivermectin with medicated food pellets was effective in controlling intestinal strongylosis in captive zebras. The opportunity to treat captive ungulates with an in-feed anthelmintic is discussed in relation to the fractious nature of these animals, which often impairs helminth control programs in zoo-parks...|$|E
40|$|The residue {{depletion}} of thiamphenicol (TAP) {{was investigated in}} the sea-bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) after 5 days' treatment with medicated food at a dose of 15 or 30 mg/kg bw/day. Fish were sampled for blood and muscle + skin from 3 h until 14 days after treatment. Thiamphenicol concentrations were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Thiamphenicol concentrations measured 3 h after stopping treatment were 0. 77 mug/mL and 0. 91 (15 mg/kg dose) or 1. 32 mug/mL and 1. 47 mug/g (30 mg/kg dose), in plasma and muscle + skin, respectively. After a withdrawal of 3 days, plasma and tissue concentrations were: 0. 08 mug/mL and 0. 03 mug/g (lower dose) or 0. 12 mug/mL and 0. 06 mug/g (higher dose), respectively, Thiamphenicol was not detectable either in plasma or in tissues on days 7, 10 and 14 following withdrawal of the medicated food. Based on maximum residue levels (MRL) for TAP in fin fish, established at 50 mug/kg for muscle and skin in natural proportions, a withdrawal period of 5 and 6 days is proposed, after treatment at 15 or 3 0 mg/kg of TAP with <b>medicated</b> feed <b>pellets,</b> respectively, to avoid the presence of violative residues in the edible tissues of the sea-bass...|$|R
40|$|Diflubenzuron, a chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{is used as}} a parasiticide against {{sea lice}} in farmed salmonids. It is administered orally via <b>medicated</b> feed <b>pellets.</b> Due to low bioavailability and biliary secretion of the active drug, diflubenzuron is released into the water column adsorbed to organic particles in faecal matter. Feed spills are also a source of contamination into the environment during medication periods. Consequently, there is a risk that non-target organisms could consume diflubenzuron during and after treatment periods via organic particles from sea pens. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of diflubenzuron in non-target fish species. In this study, the standard diflubenzuron treatment (3 mg/kg once daily for 14 days) has been administered to Atlantic cod with a mean weight of 104 g (lower and upper bounds 65 and 165 g) at a water temperature of 7. 7 °C, and samples of fillet and skin in natural proportions, liver, terminal colon and bile have been collected during and in the period following the medication period (day 4, 8, 12, 15, 18, 22, 29, 36 and 44). The primary objective has been to determine the tissue levels of diflubenzuron obtained in Atlantic cod, as well as the depuration half lives in the different tissues, through HPLC/MS. A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether PCA, a toxic metabolite of diflubenzuron, is formed in Atlantic cod, through qualitative HPLC/MS/MS analysis of fillet and skin samples. During the medication period, the calculated tissue levels in fillet and skin and liver showed high variability. This is probably due to individual differences in feed consumption, and to a lesser extent differences in absorption. The median tissue levels obtained in fillet and skin and liver were 36. 1 and 106 ng/g, respectively. This is very low compared to Atlantic salmon, in which a mean concentration of 2240 ng/g in fillet and skin has been found at 6 °C 1 day after standard treatment (EMEA, 1999). Furthermore, no fillet and skin samples throughout the medication period exceeded the MRL value of 1000 ng/g. There was a high uncertainty in the calculated depuration half-lives due to low tissue concentrations and high variation between samples, but all half-lives were less than 1 day. PCA was not detected in any of the fillet and skin samples throughout the medication period at a LOD of 2 ng/g. In terms of consumer safety, there appears to be little risk associated with the consumption of wild caught Atlantic cod that may have fed on spills of medicated feed from sea pens during diflubenzuron treatment, because diflubenzuron seems to have a low gastrointestinal uptake in Atlantic cod, and the toxic metabolite PCA was not detected in fillet and skin samples...|$|R
40|$|In the past, wild rabbits {{remained}} only in Spain and in {{the south}} of France. Currently, in Italy, this lagomorph is not uniformly distributed: its greatest presence is recorded in Sicily and Sardinia, where the habitat is very similar to the ancestral one. The specie is very important as game and food for many threatened animals of the Mediterranean area: so, there is an important decline in numerousness. The aim {{of this paper is to}} test what is the best age of reintroduction in nature using a “soft release” method, in acclimatization pens nearby the breeding farm, limiting mortality due to stress, transport and social factors. The trial was conducted in the mountain area of Palermo district, characterised by a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and mild winter. First, counts of animals were made using the method of nocturnal light census and pellet counts, in order to establish where to capture and where to reintroduce the animals. Capture methods used are traps or ferrets. The captured animals were subdivided according to sex, measured, and their health status is accurately checked. If wild rabbits exhibit the typical biometrical data, they are used as breeders in specialised farms (Regional Law n. 33 / 97) : they were ear-marked, vaccinated and treated for parasites. Thus, it starts a breeding period similar to the common rabbit. So, the new-born were transferred in an acclimatization area built on dry ground with a slight slope, where no herbicides have been used to avoid poisoning and rich in natural shrub vegetation and trees. A fence of a narrow mesh, 40 cm underground, 2 m high and supported by cement poles, prevents the intrusion of predators and the escape of rabbits. Inside the area there is a canopy that protects hay and a feeder with <b>medicated</b> <b>pellets</b> to aid the immune system because stress related to environmental change is high. If the rabbits have retained good wildness, they will soon begin to dig their own burrows. It was noted that 180 days-old animals were more disoriented and less inclined to leave the cage in comparison with 60 days animals that showed greater adaptability and ability to survive after release. Generally, most death occoured during the first week after releasing, without any differences among sex; higher mortality is revealed for older animal that settle more slowly, being not able to eat and to build lairs for defending from predators. From the second week, mortality is similar for all the classes of age...|$|E
