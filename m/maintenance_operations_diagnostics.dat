40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the Space Station Electrical Power System (EPS) as currently envisioned, artificial intelligence/expert system techniques are being investigated to automate <b>operations,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and <b>diagnostic</b> functions. A study was conducted to investigate this technology as it applies to failure detection, isolation, and reconfiguration (FDIR) and health monitoring of power system components and of the total system. Control system utilization of expert systems for load scheduling and shedding operations was also researched. A discussion of the utilization of artificial intelligence/expert systems for Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the Space Station effort is presented along with future plans at Rocketdyne for the utilization of this technology for enhanced Space Station power capability...|$|R

40|$|California {{community}} college leaders are looking for strategies to sustain facilities and <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> because the governor only approved the allocation of $ 87. 5 million in the 2014 - 2015 Budget Act for facilities <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> Guided by the change and strategy theories, {{the purpose of this}} multicase study was to explore the strategies that a select group of college leaders have used to sustain or improve their facilities <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> The data collection process included a review of college planning documents and semistructured interviews with 10 senior administrators from 3 large California {{community college}}s who have used strategies to address sustaining or improving their facilities <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> Saldana coding and an inductive analysis process were used to identify themes. Triangulation was employed to increase the trustworthiness of interpretations. The analysis revealed the central role of planning as the strategy leaders should employ to improve institutional success. Funding was an additional theme leaders regarded as the issue that most often undermined planning and effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> All participants acknowledged the need for the integration of planning and funding to create institutional success. These findings suggest that {{community college leaders}} who use planning, funding strategies, maintenance strategies, and who empower people to sustain facility and <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> can improve the teaching-learning environment. When community college leaders transform the teaching-learning environment, they enable student success. Student success increases the earning power of students that contributes to social change by expanding the tax-base and creating greater economic development...|$|R

Faulty in building design can lead to many maintenance problem in the building and lead to building defects. The aimed for this research is aimed to establish the criteria of faulty building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> of state mosque. The methodology used in this study was based on semi-structure interview and fieldwork to determine faulty in building design and identify the factor in faulty building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation..</b> Three (3) case studies at Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin Mosque, Putrajaya, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Mosque, Selangor and Malacca Straits Mosque, Melaka have been selected to do this research. Each of the respondents at the building has been involved in <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> work which is Facility Manager and Head of Building Management. This research resulted that three main factors of building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> which is defect in design, defect in material and defect in maintenance. The factors can lead to increase of maintenance budget in the building hence it can affect the quality and performance of the building. Building maintenance is important for every building and consideration of <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> work in building design need to be emphasizing to prevent and prolong building lifetime and performance...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} in the literature {{for the management of}} a set of railway <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> However, these methods consider <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> as deterministic and known a priori. In the stochastic tactical railway maintenance problem (STRMP), <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> are not known in advance. In fact, since future track conditions can only be predicted, <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> become stochastic. STRMP is based on a rolling horizon. For each month of the rolling horizon, an adaptive plan must be addressed. Each adaptive plan becomes deterministic, since it consists of a particular subproblem of the whole STRMP. Nevertheless, an exact resolution of each plan along the rolling horizon would be too time-consuming. Therefore, a heuristic approach that can provide efficient solutions within a reasonable computational time is required. Although STRMP has already been introduced in the literature, little work has been done in terms of solution methods and computational results. The main contributions of this paper include new methodology developments, a linear model for the deterministic subproblem, three efficient heuristics for the fast and effective resolution of each deterministic subproblem, and extensive computational results...|$|R
40|$|In ITER, <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> in {{the vessel}} and in the Hot Cell will be largely done by Remote Handling (RH). Remotely {{performed}} maintenance actions {{tend to be more}} time-costly than actions performed by direct human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate situational feedback, a two-armed master slave manipulator system can mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting the design for simplified <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> can yield significant time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design For Assembly (DFA). This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be applied to simplify <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> for ITER. While DFA is normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product, it is possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new insights and provides additional value...|$|R

This paper deals with investigation on the challenges in the implementation of <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint Plan for Iskandar Malaysia among five local authorities in Iskandar Malaysia. A total of 25 respondents have been selected and interviewed. The data have been analyzed qualitatively. Base on the interview, the results show that there are challenges to implement <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operation</b> blueprint in local authority immovable asset maintenance management which are no clear direction from the top management to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, lack of staff to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, did not have enough time to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia and the high cost required to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia. This article can serve as a foundation for future studies in critical success factors to implement immovable asset <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operation</b> blueprint. A future study investigating critical success factors to implement immovable asset <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operation</b> blueprint would be very interesting to produce a new approach for successful blueprint implementation...|$|R
