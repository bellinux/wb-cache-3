5000|$|Thurman, {{who lived}} in Palm Springs, California until her death on September 17, 2012, {{became one of the}} most {{familiar}} radio voices of the late 1950s in her role as Miss <b>Monitor.</b> <b>Jack</b> Gould, writing in The New York Times, described her as someone who [...] "made the weather report sound like an irresistible invitation to an unforgettable evening."It began during a modeling assignment on the Today show, where she caught the eye and ear of one of the producers who was part of the Monitor planning team. With her alluring, breathy delivery heard against a background of lush, romantic music, Thurman gave NBC's sexy weekend weather reports from 1955 until 1961. While Bob and Ray stayed at NBC all weekend to spontaneously go on the air in case of technical problems with scheduled remotes, Thurman was there throughout the weekend to do her hourly weather reports. Dennis Hart, the author of Monitor: The Last Great Radio Show (2002), recalled: Tedi Thurman, she was an actress, she had done a little bit of radio, she had done some television, but she was a model. And it was Weaver who came up with the idea of doing weather in a way it had never been done before. She would come into the studios and be there virtually every hour of the 40-hour weekend with just a few breaks, and she would do weather with this lush music behind her. To say the least, Miss Monitor probably became the most recognizable female voice in the country within a few short months after she went on Monitor.|$|E

50|$|Ardour's {{recording}} {{abilities are}} limited by only the hardware it is run on; there are no built in limits in the software. When recording on top of existing material, Ardour can do latency compensation, positioning the recorded material where {{it was intended to}} be when recording it. Monitoring options include monitoring with external hardware (a feature dependent on sound card support), monitoring with Ardour itself, and <b>monitoring</b> with <b>JACK</b> Audio Connection Kit (<b>JACK).</b> <b>Monitoring</b> with Ardour makes it possible to apply plug-in effects to the signal while it is recorded in real-time, although with some unavoidable, yet ideally unnoticeable, amount of latency. Using the audio server JACK, Ardour can record both from the audio card and JACK-compatible software concurrently.|$|R
5000|$|Upon returning, {{they are}} given another psionic implant, drain. Jack's third and final {{training}} mission is across several rooftops. He completes this with flying colors, then reports to Blake, who congratulates him. In fact, Jack has placed himself {{right up there with}} Blake himself... and their late father, a revered LightStormer who was a personal friend of U.N. President Krieger. Then Blake gets an emergency call, a crew of Cryo-Pirates have commandeered a space station in Jupiter's orbit. Blake sends Jack to activate the station's self-destruct sequence, which Jack does. Unbeknownst to both him and Blake, however, a mysterious girl named Eve is <b>monitoring</b> <b>Jack</b> in action and says: [...] "This Jack Curtis might be the one we've been looking for." [...] Back at LightStormer HQ, Blake promotes Jack to corporal for proving his value in the field; Jack has accomplished, in one mission, what took their dad three missions.|$|R

50|$|At the hospital, <b>Jack's</b> <b>monitor</b> signifies {{change in}} his brain activity. While Ianto stays with Jack, Stella and Gwen observe the other victims; Stella {{suggesting}} that their brains are all connected somehow, as the patients' monitors are reacting in unison. Gwen begs Stella to do her best in healing them as she leaves to investigate the cause behind the phone calls.|$|R
50|$|At the {{bankruptcy}} auction, Lutetia tells Max that she wishes him well and sends him a masseuse. While Earl keeps {{looking out for}} Kevin through his <b>monitors,</b> Berger, <b>Jack,</b> Windham, and Edwina set their scheme in motion. Edwina and Windham are disguised as waiters, with the real waiters bound and gagged in their truck. Berger is disguised as the auctioneer, while Jack is his associate, having tied up and gagged the original auctioneer. Shelly hacks into Max's security system. The crooks steal {{as much as they}} can, and later flee. Windham plants smoke bombs to obscure their escape and calls the fire brigade. At 2:00 Shelly plants a video of Kevin delivering a message to Max that he was being robbed without him being there on Earl's monitors.|$|R
40|$|A {{deep level}} sewer installation, {{employing}} a trenchless technology method required {{as a result}} of excavations for a new freeway in Athens, is described. For the first time, pipes had to be jacked to drive sections over 200 m in length under the city. In addition to its technical merits, the method provided advantages in terms of social and environmental issues. Very little traffic disturbance was caused, together with no disruption of other services or creation of dust pollution during construction. It also did not damage the pavements of the city. This contrasts to the scars left on the roads, due to trenching. Pipe jacking, however, needs the construction of shafts along the alignment, arranged at distances determined by the cost effectiveness of the system to jack the pipes. It was decided to <b>monitor</b> the <b>jacking</b> force requirements as the pipes advanced. This response during driving was then analyzed and compared to the predictions presented by other researchers. Such measurements and analyses may allow for the formation of a database to permit the right choice of an appropriate excavation unit and the successful planning of any future similar projects.

50|$|The next day, Chucky gets Andy {{to visit}} the house of Chucky's former accomplice, Eddie. While Andy goes to the bathroom, Chucky manages {{to blow up the}} building, killing Eddie. The detectives are called in to check out the scene, and again find Andy there. As they see this as more than a coincidence, they get Dr. Ardmore to <b>monitor</b> as <b>Jack</b> {{questions}} Andy. When Jack asks why Maggie fell out of the window, Andy says that she saw Chucky, and it scared her so much she fell down. Karen comes to Andy's side, and explains that no one believes him; if he does not tell the truth, the police will take him away from her. Scared, Andy confronts Chucky, begging him to say something. As he simply repeats his doll lines, he runs to his mother, telling her Chucky is doing it on purpose, and would kill him if he ever told anyone about him. From behind the glass, Ardmore, announces his presence. Seeing more than enough, he suggests Andy stay a few days at the hospital, and with no real choice, Karen reluctantly hands over her son.|$|R
5000|$|An {{unofficial}} expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar {{dubbed the}} [...] "Catbox" [...] {{was released by}} the Rockford, Illinois company ICD. It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, {{in the second quarter}} of 1994, but was not actually released until mid-1995. The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions. These are audio, video, and communications. It features six output formats, three for audio (line level stereo, RGB <b>monitor,</b> headphone <b>jack</b> with volume control) and three for video (composite, S-Video, and RGB analog component video) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time. It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and RS-232 as well as DSP pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems. The ICD CatBox features a polished stainless steel casing and red LEDs in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity. An IBM AT type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together. The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.|$|R
50|$|Vera was {{restricted}} {{for most of}} 2007 to her house due to an injury to her ankle and was cared by Tyrone and Molly Compton (Vicky Binns). They bought her a baby <b>monitor</b> so <b>Jack,</b> Molly and Tyrone could talk to Vera {{while they were in}} the pub. Later, Jack and Vera's grandson Paul Clayton arrived on the street but little did Vera know that Paul was scamming Jack and Vera out of money, stealing money from Jack and blaming it on Tyrone. Vera was disappointed in Tyrone but Molly was adamant that Tyrone hadn't stolen the money. Vera refused to believe this of Molly and could never believe that her own flesh and blood could steal from her. Jack & Vera celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary with a party at the Rovers in August 2007. Vera decided that she and Jack were to move to their dream place of Blackpool but Paul was forced to confess to Jack that he had stolen the money for the house. Jack was appalled but had to keep it secret from Vera as he didn't want to hurt her and destroy her dreams. Vera still desperately wanted to move to Blackpool so Jack eventually told Vera that {{he spent a lot of}} the money they saved to help Paul buy his half of the restaurant, but added the excuse that he spent it before he knew they were going to Blackpool. Jack knew that if he told Vera the truth she would be heart broken and she was still greatly upset and went to bed to get over the shock.|$|R
500|$|Gwen is {{introduced}} in the first episode of Torchwood, in which she—a Cardiff police officer— witnesses Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and his team interrogating a dead man in an alley. After investigating the Torchwood team, she locates the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff branch, home to a team of alien hunters. Though Jack wipes her memories, they are later triggered by reports of murders committed with exotic weaponry. Torchwood's own Suzie Costello (Indira Varma) is the serial killer. Gwen is present at Suzie's attempt to kill Jack, and Suzie's ensuing suicide. Jack reveals that he cannot die and offers Gwen a job in Torchwood. Jack and Gwen's relationship takes on a romantic hue, despite her long-standing relationship with boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen). Gwen falls into a short-lived destructive affair with colleague Owen (Burn Gorman), after a particularly traumatic experience with cannibals, which she cannot share with Rhys. Shortly afterwards, Gwen is targeted and almost killed by a vengeful undead Suzie. In their conversations, Gwen is shocked to realise {{the extent to which}} Torchwood neglected Suzie's emotional welfare, and Suzie is resentful towards Gwen, who has replaced her both professionally, and as Owen's lover. Wracked with guilt, Gwen confesses her affair with Owen after it ends in [...] "Combat", but she drugs Rhys with an amnesia pill so he will not remember her confession. In the series one finale, her desire to resurrect a murdered Rhys motivates her to mutiny against Jack by opening the rift in time and space which Torchwood <b>monitors.</b> After <b>Jack</b> sacrifices himself to the released supernatural demon, Gwen maintains a vigil, certain that he will resurrect. As she loses hope, giving Jack a parting kiss, he awakens and thanks her. Shortly afterwards, Jack abandons Torchwood to reunite with the mysterious [...] "Doctor" [...] from his past.|$|R
50|$|While Smithers {{goes into}} hiding, Alex returns {{home to find}} that Jack has been kidnapped by Scorpia. He finds a note telling {{him to go to}} a {{cemetery}} called the City of the Dead alone, or else she will die. Alex heads to the City of the Dead, where he is confronted by Julius and Gunter, who gives him the sniper rifle he acquired from the House of Gold and takes several pictures of Alex holding it. Alex is taken to Razim's fort, where he reunites with Jack. Razim tells Alex that he will be his next subject for his experiment and allows him to spend the day with Jack. That night, Alex is taken to Razim's laboratory, where Alex watches a video of Jack in a television <b>monitor.</b> Alex watches <b>Jack</b> as she escapes from her cell, knocks out a guard, and steals a Land Rover. However, Razim had in fact engineered this to allow Jack to flee; he reveals to Alex that the Land Rover is filled with explosives and gives Julius a detonator to blow up the Land Rover. Despite Alex's beg, Julius blows up the Land Rover, killing Jack. Overwhelmed with grief, Alex passes out.|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer(FRP) {{is a new}} {{composite material}} with excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. It is a significant way to solve the durability problem of anchor rod by substituting this polymer for steel bars. Using anchor-rod-structure specimen made from glass fiber reinforced polymer(GFRP) bars with fiber grating installed internally, loaded by hollow hydraulic <b>jack,</b> <b>monitored</b> by grating sensing technology, this paper focuses on the failure mechanism of large-diameter sand-coated GFRP rebar in the frame beams under the condition of anchoring. Research shows that in the experiment, in terms of tensile force and average bond strength, this large-diameter(25 mm) GFRP rebar has reached the design strength of ribbed steel with the same diameter. The most reasonable thickness of frame beam varies from 30 to 40 cm. Transient loading cycles have no obvious influence on GFRP rebar interface-bond state; the degradation of rod body interface-bond state will occur under sustained loads, {{and it continues to}} develop and expand to the deeper part. Moreover, the greater the load applied is, the deeper the depth extended to is and the faster the degradation proceeds. Optical fiber grating monitoring technology is an effective method to find and observe the interface-bond state degradation process. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
