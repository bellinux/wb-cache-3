50|$|A major {{drawback}} to this architecture {{is the fact}} that a missed two-tone sequence {{at the beginning of a}} transmission, or a lost signal during a transmission, causes the rest of a transmission to be missed. If the <b>mobile</b> <b>receiver</b> gets interference or loses the repeater signal for the moment the second selective calling tone is sent, it remains muted, missing the entire conversation. The same is true if the repeater signal is lost at any time during a transmission. Only another two-tone sequence being sent will allow it to rejoin the conversation.|$|E
50|$|Direction finding (DF), {{or radio}} {{direction}} finding (RDF), is the measurement of the direction from which a received signal was transmitted. This can refer to radio {{or other forms of}} wireless communication, including radar signals detection and monitoring (ELINT/ESM). By combining the direction information from two or more suitably spaced receivers (or a single <b>mobile</b> <b>receiver),</b> the source of a transmission may be located via triangulation. Radio direction finding is used in the navigation of ships and aircraft, to locate emergency transmitters for search and rescue, for tracking wildlife, and to locate illegal or interfering transmitters. RDF was important in combating German threats during both the World War II Battle of Britain and the long running Battle of the Atlantic. In the former, the Air Ministry also used RDF to locate its own fighter groups and vector them to detected German raids.|$|E

In 2002 it became the Tennessee Aquarium Research Institute (TNARI), and in 2011 was renamed as the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute to emphasize its conservation mission.

Since then, its workspace has been divided between its propagation facility in Cohutta, and other activities based at the Aquarium in Chattanooga and its animal care facility.

The utility of the new results is demonstrated by comparison with the correlation function estimates of measured data. Point of contact: Ali Abd...|$|E

The use of optical and ultrasound signals instead of the conventional radio wave signal makes the proposed approach suitable for environments with high levels of electromagnetic interference or where the propagation of radio frequencies is entirely restricted.
