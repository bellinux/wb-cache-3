40|$|Objectives To assess {{differences}} in <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> around implants placed in maxillary pristine bone and implants placed following maxillary sinus augmentation {{over a period}} of 3  years after functional loading. Material and methods Two cohorts of subjects (Group 1 : Subjects who received sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant placement; Group 2 : Subjects who underwent conventional implant placement in posterior maxillary pristine bone) were included in this retrospective study. Radiographic <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> was measured around one implant per patient on digitized panoramic radiographs that were obtained at the time of prosthesis delivery (baseline) and 12, 24, and 36  months later. The influence of age, gender, smoking habits, history of periodontal disease, and type of prosthetic connection (internal or external) on <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> was analyzed in function of the type of osseous support (previously grafted or pristine). Results A total of 105 subjects were included in this study. Cumulative radiographic <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> ranged from 0  mm to 3. 9  mm after 36  months of functional loading. There were statistically significant {{differences in}} <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> between implants placed in grafted and pristine bone at the 12 ‐month assessment, but not in the subsequent progression rate. External prosthetic connection, smoking, and history of periodontitis negatively influenced peri‐implant bone maintenance, regardless of the type of osseous substrate. Conclusions Implants placed in sites that received maxillary sinus augmentation exhibited more <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> than implants placed in pristine bone, although <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> mainly occurred during the first 12  months after functional loading.

50|$|The {{main reason}} for using either MDCL method (or the {{combination}} of the two) is to save power and money. Alternatively, for the same total power consumption, the transmission coverage can be somewhat improved. The AMC method has two other advantages. It limits the peak voltages on transmitter and antenna circuits, possibly preventing damaging arcs. Also, if the degree of AMC is properly adjusted, the power drawn from the mains can be kept nearly constant with modulation. This is especially important when operating from a local generator. With conventional DCC the load variations on a generator are made worse. With both methods, the main disadvantage is <b>marginal</b> <b>loss</b> of coverage, comparable to running slightly less power. Also in lower signal strength parts of the coverage area, a station using Dynamic Carrier Control {{may be more likely to}} be skipped on digital-tuned radios during seek/scan tuning (if the frequency is passed during carrier reduction), an issue compounded by manual tuning (instead of seek/scan) selection not being easy on some receivers.|$|E

50|$|The {{emerging}} American star Kevin Young was unbeaten {{prior to}} the Barcelona Olympics, aside from a <b>marginal</b> <b>loss</b> to Winthrop Graham in the semi final round (Graham running his personal best to date in that effort). Running in lane 4, Young appeared to have the slowest reaction to the gun of the field. To his inside, Graham was the first over the first hurdle.

Between the next two hurdles he ran 12 strides, alternating to the right leg lead over the fourth hurdle. Over the fifth hurdle had had made up the stagger on Kriss Akabusi to his outside. Relative to the hurdles, he had clearly passed Graham {{with the rest of}} the field clearly a full stride or more behind. Running 13 strides the rest of the way, he passed the rest of the competitors to his outside between the next two hurdles. A one stride lead over Graham at the eight hurdle became two by the ninth as Young was still powerful as Graham was struggling. In the battle for bronze, Stéphane Diagana had a slight lead over Akabusi over the eighth hurdle, but Akabusi clearly broke away between eight and nine, which Diagana struggled to clear. Young tried to maintain his power into the final hurdle though he came up a little short, catching the face of the hurdle with his lead leg heel, riding the hurdle to the ground. He maintained his powerful stride to the finish. Realizing he had the clear victory, Young raised his right arm in celebration 10 meters before the finish, slowing his last four strides. Still, Young crossed the finish line with a new world record, taking almost a quarter of a second out of Edwin Moses' 9 year old record. Graham held on for second, as Akabusi was unable to make up the gap with Diagana unable to recover the distance he had lost to Akabusi.|$|E

40|$|Background When {{a foreign}} body {{is placed in}} bone or soft tissue, an {{inflammatory}} reaction inevitably develops. Hence, osseointegration is but a foreign body response to the implant, which according to classic pathology is a chronic inflammatory response and characterized by bone embedding/separation of the implant from the body. Purpose The aim {{of this paper is}} to suggest an alternative way of looking at the reason for <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> as a complication to treatment rather than a disease process. Materials and Methods The present paper is authored as a narrative review contribution. Results The implant-enveloping bone has sparse blood circulation and is lacking proper innervation in clear contrast to natural teeth that are anchored in bone by a periodontal ligament rich in blood vessels and nerves. Fortunately, a balanced, steady state situation of the inevitable foreign body response will be established for the great majority of implants, seen as maintained osseointegration with no or only very little <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss.</b> <b>Marginal</b> bone resorption around the implant is the result of different tissue reactions coupled to the foreign body response and is not primarily related to biofilm-mediated infectious processes as in the pathogenesis of periodontitis around teeth. This means that initial marginal bone resorption around implants represents a reaction to treatment and is not at all a disease process. There is clear evidence that the initial foreign body response to the implant can be sustained and aggravated by various factors related to implant hardware, patient characteristics, surgical and/or prosthodontic mishaps, which may lead to significant <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> and possibly to implant failure. Admittedly, once severe <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> has developed, a secondary biofilm-mediated infection may follow as a complication to the already established bone loss. Conclusions The present authors regard researchers seeing <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> as a periodontitis-like disease to be on the wrong track; the onset of <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> around oral implants depends in reality on a dis-balanced foreign body response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Cost {{allocation}} of losses in power networks {{is an essential}} issue especially under modern electricity markets with high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES). This paper proposes the application of an efficient loss allocation method developed to evaluate the <b>marginal</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients of dispersed generation. The coefficients provide the contribution to the active and reactive losses of each producer/consumer in order to define the respective tariffs. One innovative feature of the proposed loss allocation method is that, unlike other proposed approaches, it is irrespective of the reference bus selection and takes in consideration the impact of reactive flows on active power losses. Crete's power system has been considered as a representative study case for the demonstration of the presented method.

Materials and Methods: The pertinent literature was searched by using the PubMed database and requesting major manufacturers to provide reports of their commercially available dental implant systems.

40|$|On current days, many of {{the power}} markets are {{adopting}} the practice of <b>marginal</b> <b>loss</b> pricing. The dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model is still mostly used {{for the purpose of}} market clearing owing to its simplicity, robustness and higher speed of convergence. Within the DCOPF framework, transmission line losses are represented as additional external loads on the system. In the classical DCOPF model of <b>marginal</b> <b>loss</b> pricing, as implemented in the New England market, the aggregated network loss is distributed over the system nodes in a fixed ratio. To gain more design flexibility in the distribution of system losses, a matrix loss distribution (MLD) framework is developed in this paper maintaining compatibility with financial transmission rights. In MLD, each individual line is considered separately for the purpose of loss distribution. The ratio in which the power loss in a certain line is distributed can be different from that in which the power loss in another line is distributed.

40|$|Successful osseointegration is {{the result}} of a {{controlled}} foreign body reaction to dental implants. Osseointegrated implants have demonstrated excellent long-term survivability, although they may be subject to limited <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss.</b> <b>Marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> during the first few years after implant placement seldom represents disease, but is instead the result of an adaptive bone response to surgical trauma and implant loading. It is not uncommon for implants with early <b>marginal</b> bone <b>loss</b> to enter a long-lasting state of bone stability. Extensive bone resorption after the first year is generally due to an exacerbation of adverse body reactions caused by non-optimal implant components, adverse surgery or prosthodontics and/or compromised patient factors. Disease in the form of peri-implantitis is a late complication that affects some implants with suppuration and rapid loss of crestal bone, and is probably caused by bacterial pathogens and immunological reactions. Unfortunately, the literature is not consistent with respect to the type or magnitude of clinical implant problems, including how they are defined and diagnosed. If the peri-implantitis diagnosis is confined to cases with infection, suppuration and significant bone loss, the frequency of the disease is relatively low, which is in sharp contrast to the frequencies reported with unrealistic definitions of peri-implantitis. We suggest that when modern implants are placed by properly trained individuals, only 1 – 2 % of implants show true peri-implantitis during follow-up periods of 10 years or more.
