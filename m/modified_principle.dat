The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or <b>modifies</b> <b>principles,</b> which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, {{in which it is}} counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} {{study of a}} new Spray On Demand print-head (SOD) is performed.

After establishing a more general equation of the motion of a vibrating tube filled with fluid using Hamilton’s <b>modified</b> <b>principle,</b> an analytical solution is proposed allowing to determine the volume flow rate generated by {{the motion of the}} tube motion. The maximum entropy formalism (MEF) is used to predict the drop size distribution and the Sauter Mean Diameter of the SOD.

40|$|The elastic {{instability}} of an internally-pressurized cylindrical tank with a torispherical head is investigated using a triangular, doubly curved, thin-shell finite element. The {{formulation of the}} finite element, which is based upon cubic displacement functions and a <b>modified</b> <b>principle</b> of potential energy, is first described. Then, the element is verified by comparing numerical results for the linear, stable analysis to alternative solutions for the same problem. The subsequent instability investigation includes {{the solution of the}} linearized problem of equilibrium bifurcation, that is, of the classical eigenvalue problem, and a general nonlinear analysis, based on tracing the nonlinear load-displacement path. The critical pressure, obtained with use of the general nonlinear analysis, agrees closely with an experimental result as well as with a numerical solution stemming from an axisymmetric formulation...|$|E

The pro-posed method {{is based on the}} pixel-level misregistration map and the gradients of the registered image.

40|$|I {{propose a}} new and direct {{connection}} between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics where I derive the quantum mechanical propagator from a variational principle. This variational principle is Hamilton's <b>modified</b> <b>principle</b> generalized to allow many paths due to the non-local existence of particles in phase space. This principle allows a physical system to evolve non-locally in phase space while still allowing a representation that uses many classical paths. Whereas a point in phase space represents a classical system's state, I represent the state of a non-local system by a mixed trajectory. This formulation naturally leads to the transactional interpretation for resolving the paradoxes of the measurement problem. This principle also suggests a more flexible framework for formulating theories based on invariant actions and provides a single conceptual framework for discussing many areas of science.

40|$|Systems with Hamiltonians of {{the form}} Ho(p) + Hi(q, p, t) are considered. A variational {{principle}} is proposed for defining that canonical transformation, continuously connected with the identity transformation, which minimizes the residual, coordinate-dependent {{part of the new}} Hamiltonian. The principle is based on minimization of the mean square generalized force over phase space and time. The transformation reduces to the action-angle transformation {{in that part of the}} phase space of an integrable system where the orbit topology is that of the unperturbed system, or on primary KAM surfaces. General arguments in favour of this definition are given, based on Galilean invariance, decay of the Fourier spectrum, and its ability to include external fields or inhomogeneous systems. The optimal oscillation-center transformation for the physical pendulum (or particle in a sinusoidal potential) is constructed analytically.

Consequently, clinicians may feel caught in a moral dilemma: between doing the good they seek and avoid-ing the harm they foresee. The dilemma is that when investi-gating global developmental delay {{it is not possible}} to avoid all the anticipated negative outcomes of genetic testing and con-currently fulfill our obligations to do the good from which these harmful effects result. It is imperative to recognize dilemmas especially where the moral questions or relevant facts are not as clear cut as in ethics textbooks and to bring their moral questions into a structured dialogue with the patient and his or her family.

40|$|Summary The {{primitive}} endoderm epithelial {{structure in}} mouse blastocysts forms following cell differentiation and subsequent sorting, and this two-step {{process can be}} reproduced in vitro using an embryoid body model. We found that in the chimeric embryoid bodies consisting of paired wildtype and E-cadherin null ES cells, the wildtype sorted to the center and were enveloped by the less adhesive E-cadherin null cells, in accord with Steinberg's hypothesis. However, wildtype and N-cadherin null ES cells intermixed and did not segregate, a situation that {{may be explained by}} Albert Harris' <b>modified</b> <b>principle,</b> which incorporates the unique properties of living cells. Furthermore, in chimeric embryoid bodies composed of N-cadherin and E-cadherin null ES cells, the two weakly interacting cell types segregated but did not envelop one another. Lastly, the most consistent and striking observation was that differentiated cells sorted to the surface and formed an enveloping layer, regardless of the relative cell adhesive affinity of any cell combination, supporting the hypothesis that the ability of the differentiated cells to establish apical polarity is the determining factor in surface sorting and positioning...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a hybrid-mixed finite element formulation for the quasi-static geometrically exact analysis of three-dimensional framed structures with linear elastic behavior. The formulation is based on a <b>modified</b> <b>principle</b> of stationary total complementary energy, involving, as independent variables, the generalized vectors of stress-resultants and displacements and, in addition, a set of Lagrange multipliers defined on the element boundaries. The finite element discretization scheme adopted {{within the framework of the}} proposed formulation leads to numerical solutions that strongly satisfy the equilibrium differential equations in the elements, as well as the equilibrium boundary conditions. This formulation consists, therefore, in a true equilibrium formulation for large displacements and rotations in space. Furthermore, this formulation is objective, as it ensures invariance of the strain measures under superposed rigid body rotations, and is not affected by the so-called shear-locking phenomenon. Also, the proposed formulation produces numerical solutions which are independent of the path of deformation. To validate and assess the accuracy of the proposed formulation, some benchmark problems are analyzed and their solutions compared with those obtained using the standard two-node displacement/ rotation-based formulation.
