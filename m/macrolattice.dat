40|$|We have {{synthesized}} the nanostructured poly(ether urethane) s of cross-linked and branched topology {{by using}} a mixture of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS-M) containing tertiary amine and primary and secondary hydroxyl groups in the organic part of molecules. These compounds are characterized by methods of IR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and small angle X-ray scattering. The structure of the materials is characterized by nanosized clusters enriched with the inorganic phase forming a paracrystalline <b>macrolattice</b> with hexagonal symmetry. The sizes of clusters, contents of the inorganic phase in them, {{and the value of}} <b>macrolattice</b> periodicity are determined by the topology of synthesized poly(ether urethane) s...|$|E
40|$|Model {{segmented}} polyurethanes (SPUs) prepared {{from either}} oxypropylene glycol oligomer or butylene adipate glycol oligomer, both of molar mass 2 kg/mol (soft fragments, SFT), and three different diisocyanates (all-trans 4. 4 '-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, t, t-HMDI- 1. 0; HMDI with 20 % of trans isomers, t, t-HMDI- 0. 2; and 4, 4 '-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, MDI) (stiff fragments, STF) {{were characterized by}} specific heat capacity measurements in the temperature interval 140 - 540 K, and by wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering at room temperature. Limited miscibility of SFT and STF chain components resulted in incomplete separation into a regular three-dimensional <b>macrolattice</b> of STF-rich microdomains and SFT-rich microphases. The composition of STF-rich microdomains was estimated by fitting the softening temperatures to the Couchman's equation, whereas the relative contents of SFT-rich and STF-rich microphases were assessed by comparing the specific heat capacity change at the glass transition temperatures to corresponding additive values. The overall degree of microphase separation, {{as well as the}} mean <b>macrolattice</b> spacings between STF microdomains decreased in the order, MDI > t, t-HMDI- 1. 0 much greater than t, t-HMDI- 0. 2. The conformation of STF fragments within the STF-rich microdomains changed h-om nearly extended (for MDI) through slightly contracted (for t, t-HMDI- 1. 0) to strongly contracted (for t, t-HMDI- 0. 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Firstly a short {{review of}} some {{frequently}} used models for fibre structures is given. Then a model, {{based on a}} three-dimensional monoclinic paracrystalline <b>macrolattice</b> is described. This model allows the calculation of the two-dimensional intensity distribution for the small-angle scattering from semicrystalline polymers with different orientational states. The parameters of the model result from comparison with the measured intensity. The method of analysis is applied to low-density polyethylene deformed uniaxially at different temperatures. The use of synchrotron radiation {{makes it possible to}} follow the destruction and rebuilding of the superstructure. A reversible change of the superstructure during stretching and relaxing was found for different draw ratios for very high-molecular-weight polyethylene samples...|$|E
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} {{were examined}} for styrene-butadiene (PS-PB) diblock copolymers dissolved in a PB-selective solvent, n-tetradecane (C 14). At low temperatures, the PS-PB/C 14 solutions contained micelles with PS cores and PB corona and exhibited plasticity and nonlineardynamic responses. These unique properties {{were attributed to}} a <b>macrolattice</b> of micelles, that was in turn formed as a compromise of contradicting thermodynamic requirement, an osmotic requirement of uniform PB concentration distribu-tion in the PB/C 14 corona phase and an elastic requirement of randomizing the PB block conformation. Effects of these requirements were observed also for dielectric relaxation of styrene-cis-isoprene (PS-Pl) diblock copolymer lamellar systems in bulk states. The PI blocks having type-A dipoles exhibited dielec-tric relaxation that reflected their global motion, and this relaxation was highly retarded and broadened due to the osmotic and elastic requirements...|$|E
40|$|Segmented polyurethanes from oligotetramethylene glycol 1000, 4, 4 ′-diphenylmethane {{diisocyanate}} {{and different}} chain extenders {{were characterized by}} specific heat capacity (temperature interval 130 - 450 K) and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements. A regular <b>macrolattice</b> of uniform-size micro-domains of stiff segments spanning a continuous matrix of soft segments was observed for the sample chain-extended with dihydrazide of isophthalipc acid, DIPA. The distribution of microdomains by sizes remained unchanged, whereas the overall degree of micropahase separation (DMS) increased due to dilution of DIPA and/or blocking of chain ends with crown ether-containing di- and monohydrazides. The distribution of microdomains by sizes broadened, whereas the DMS either remained unchanged or slightly decreased on dilution of DIPA with hydroxyl-containing chain extenders [1, 4 -di-N-oxy- 2, 3 -bis-(oxymethyl) -quinoxaline and 1, 4 -butane-diol, respectively]. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Oriented polymer blends {{based on}} {{high-density}} polyethylene (HDPE) are strained until failure. Twodimensional (2 D) small-angle X-ray scattering patterns monitor the nanostructure evolution. Data evaluation methods for high-precision determination of macroscopic mechanical and nanoscopic structure parameters are presented. The hardest materials exhibit a very inhomogeneous nanodomain structure. During straining their domains {{appear to be}} wedged together and inhibit transverse contraction on the nanometer scale. Further components are polyamides (PA 6, PA 12) (20 – 30 %) and as compatibilizer Yparex® 8102 (YP) (0 – 10 %). Some HDPE/PA 6 blends are additionally loaded with nanoclays (Nanomer® or Cloisite®). Blending of HDPE with PA 12 causes no synergistic effect. In the absence of nanoclay, PA 6 and HDPE form a heterogeneous nanostructure with high Young’s modulus. After addition of YP a more homogeneous scaffold structure is observed in which some of the PA 6 microfibrils and HDPE crystallites appear to be rigidly connected, but the modulus has decreased. Both kinds of nanoclay induce a transition from a structure without transverse correlation among the microfibrils into a <b>macrolattice</b> with 3 D correlations among HDPE domains from neighboring microfibrils. For extensions between 0. 7 % and 3. 5 % the scattering entities with 3 D correlation exhibit transverse elongation instead of transverse contraction. The process is interpreted as overcoming a correlation barrier executed by the crystallites in an evasion-upon-approaching mechanism. During continued straining the 3 D correlation is reduced or removed. European Union - Project NANOTOUGH FP 7 -NMP- 2007 -Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia - SFRH/BSAB/ 812 / 200...|$|E
