25|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>plywood</b> is {{manufactured}} from durable {{face and}} core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction {{is such that}} it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods. Each wood veneer will be from tropical hardwoods, have negligible core gap, limiting the chance of trapping water in the plywood and hence providing a solid and stable glue bond. It uses an exterior Water and Boil Proof (WBP) glue similar to most exterior plywoods.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from <b>marine</b> <b>plywood</b> facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look {{as if it had been}} standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E

50|$|In {{the form}} known as okoume <b>marine</b> grade <b>plywood,</b> it is {{considered}} perhaps the finest construction plywood now available for boats especially where lighter weight is needed. It is widely available manufactured and certified to British Standard 1088. Its users range from individual hobbyist kayak builders {{to some of the}} world's largest boat builders. Most often it is used in combination with epoxy and fiberglass, the combination giving a structure that can be stronger and lighter than plastic or fiberglass, rivaling the performance characteristics of more advanced composites such as carbon fiber. The grain appearance is prized, likened to that of mahogany and is often varnished for a decorative appearance.|$|R
40|$|Application {{of plywood}} {{materials}} is very wide {{and it is}} related {{to a wide range}} of industries: transportation, construction, <b>marine</b> etc. <b>Plywood</b> homogenises strength properties of wood, also significantly enhances bending stiffness. Additional value to plywood materials can be added by incorporating it into laminates with specific properties as enhanced crashworthiness, sound/vibration absorption, heat transfer insulation and electromagnetic shield properties. This work is related to increase plywood crashworthiness or impact properties. Therefore laminates have been made of one and three veneer birch plywood joined with thermoplastic polymer to different types of glass fibre and natural fibre fabrics. Incorporation of thermoplastic polymer with melting temperature close to plywood processing temperature allows unite plywood and laminates manufacturing. Also thermoplastic polymer increases vibration and impact absorption while fibre fabric materials enhance strength properties. In this research polyethylene is preferred as processing temperature of it is close to plywood, however for biodegradable composite polylactide is preferred. Implementation of natural fibre fabrics and biodegradable polymer is of interest making fully biodegradable composite, therefore exclude problems with materials accumulation in waste disposals. In this study experimental impact response evaluation of plywood/PE/fabric laminates has been performed using INSTRON 9250 HV drop-tower. Impact force and absorption energy is compared between plywood products (1, 3, 9 veneer plywood) and different configuration of layers and fabric types of plywood/thermoplastic polymer/fabric laminates. Experimental results show that single veneer of plywood has very poor impact properties. In combination with thermoplastic polymer and fibre fabric absorbed energy of plywood laminate can be increased 10 and more times depending on fibre fabric. Similar tests were performed with 3 veneer plywood where absorbed energy increased 2 - 3 times. Totally specific energy or absorbed energy per weight of plywood/PE/fabric laminates comparing to birch plywood laminates increases about 1. 5 to 4 times...|$|R
40|$|Het glazen Huis (The Glass house) De Dam, Amsterdam On {{the western}} edge of Dam Square nestled between the looming edifices of the Nieuwe Kerk & the Royal Palace, the Glazen Huis gently glows. Night has {{transformed}} the building and it’s surrounds, as the dome emits an ambient light over the square. By day, one enters the Glazen Huis through the separate satellite entrance. Following the curved ramp takes one down below ground into a tunnel, with walls lit on either side, to a subterranean level within the dome. This lower level houses ticketing, information & amenities. This floor gets a cast of natural light from the opening of the level above that allows for the ramp. By following this ramp upward one enters the lush and light filled body of the sphere. This vast open room houses an abundance of flora, with plants cascading from suspended plant beds. A single central walkway spirals upward until it reaches an expansive platform, which allows views over the historic square. From this vantage point one overlooks the layers of greenery and the pond below. The structure of the building is predominantly timber. Curved Glulam timber beams make up the dome, with steel components at the connections. The walls at the lower levels are <b>marine</b> grade <b>plywood,</b> leading up to translucent glazing, then entirely transparent glazing at the top to allow views for the visitor. The entire dome rests in a timber-lined dish, with central supporting pylons driven underground to stabilize the structure. Low emitting lights rest {{at the bottom of the}} dish, illuminating the outer walls of the building from below ground level. ‘Het Glazen Huis’ is to provide a wondrous and peaceful garden in the midst of the city of Amsterdam.

50|$|Most 1970s {{mobile homes}} were {{constructed}} from the chassis upwards utilising predominantly cheap recycled materials. Throughout this era house-truck rigs were constructed on the decks of old ex farm trucks which {{could then be}} purchased for $500 to $2500. House-buses were either stripped down to the chassis in preparation for construction or just added onto, to facilitate increased living areas. As opposed to the bright colourful American and British versions of the 1960s, many of the early Kiwi rigs were finished in earthy colored timber exteriors. This was {{due in part to}} the fact that in the 1970s the Toyota Motor company imported their new vehicles from Japan in car-crates which were constructed from reasonable quality <b>marine</b> grade <b>plywood.</b> The crates came with good quality framed floors. These were the perfect material in which to construct and clad a house truck. In the 1970s one could then purchase a complete car crate (six-sided) for around $25. An average size house-truck took up most of five car crates to build. In the 1970s a large number of derelict country farm houses from New Zealand's early colonial days were being demolished, these containing a treasure-trove of beautiful recyclable rare timbers such as kauri, totara and rimu. Other materials were purchased from timber recyclers and secondhand traders. One could purchase cheaply a good second-hand wood fired potbelly or small wood stove with a wetback attached, for cooking, heating hot water and warmth over the winter months. As most housetrucks parked in non residential areas very few of the early housetrucks were wired up for mains electricity. Gas lighting and candles were the norm. Some trucks utilized a small gas or kerosene stove to supplement cooking over hot summer months. All these items were purchased second hand. Some early 1970s rigs experimented with homemade wind turbines for lighting; however these large units even though they were fastened to the roof during travel, proved awkward. Today smaller modern units can be purchased at a reasonable price. Innovative housetruckers looking for the complete self-sufficient unit attached gas producer units to their rigs, effectively running their engines for free on charcoal gas.|$|R
5000|$|Sheet plywood boat {{building}} uses {{sheets of}} plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers {{which are all}} bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction. A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method {{is known as the}} stitch-and-glue method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. <b>Marine</b> grade <b>plywood</b> of good quality is designated [...] "WBP" [...] (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be 1.2 mm minimum) or are very thin (less than 0.5 mm) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be [...] "A" [...] quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at [...] it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the Vaurien, Cherub, Tolman, Moth and P class (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and Kolibris (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it. Another variation is tortured ply where very thin(3 mm) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.|$|R
