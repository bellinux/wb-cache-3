40|$|Those that efface {{themselves}} in the action tend to be forgotten. But molecular chaperones are always there, often serving as equal partners. Because of their intrinsic functional frailty, {{a large number of}} signaling molecules have come to depend on molecular chaperones, notably the Hsp 90 chaperone machine. This applies to the subset of nuclear receptors that converts steroid hormone signals to transcriptional outputs. Steroid receptors appear to rely on the Hsp 90 <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> <b>folding,</b> regulation of the allosteric switch and recycling. This review discusses the complexities of the chaperone machinery and the diversity of regulatory options afforded by this assistance for hormone action...|$|E

40|$|Today, as {{a result}} of {{information}} sharing and rapid sequencing, bioinformatics is deluged with data (“big data”) and faces the daunting multi-dimensional challenges of sequence, structure, expression, and pathway analyses. The explicit understanding of protein secondary structure and beyond can yield great benefit to understanding of human diseases and development of therapeutic drugs and enzymes in the ensuing years. The myriad of machine learning methodologies have their respective relative strengths in various bioinformatics disciplines: hidden Markov model for sequence and profile alignment; support vector <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> protein <b>fold</b> recognition; Bayesian networks and gene regulatory network; and artificial neural networks (ANN) and protein secondary structure prediction...|$|R

Thanks to my coaches RenC van de Molengraft and Wil Post for their support. Special thanks to Ralph Looymans for his close support all these months. Thanks to my parents for enduring the uncertainty of my graduation during all these years and last but certainly not least to my friend Roeby for her continuously necessary and much appreciated support. Summary The company Delem BV is manufacturer of electronic controllers for hydraulic press brakes. Press brakes are <b>machines</b> used <b>for</b> <b>folding</b> in the sheet metal industry. Delem has over twenty years of hands-on experience in the field of controlling hydraulic press brakes. They have been very successful and are currently the market leader in their field. The control algorithms that Delem uses can control a wide range of different press brake types with generally satisfactory performance. Market demands cd! for ever-increasing accuracy and speed.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} so-called folding {{neural networks}} {{as a mechanism}} <b>for</b> <b>machine</b> learning. <b>Folding</b> networks form a generalization of partial recurrent neural networks such {{that they are able}} to deal with tree structured inputs instead of simple linear lists. In particular, they can handle classical formulas [...] they were proposed originally for this purpose. After a short explanation of the neural architecture we show that folding networks are well suited as a learning mechanism in principle. This includes three parts: the proof of their universal approximation ability, the aspect of information theoretical learnability, and the examination of the complexity of training. Approximation ability: It is shown that any measurable function can be approximated in probability. Explicit bounds on the number of neurons result if only a finite number of points is dealt with. These bounds are new results in the case of simple recurrent networks, too. Several restrictions occur if a function is [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "envelopes" [...] {{produced}} by the Hill/De La Rue machine were not {{as we know them}} today. They were flat diamond, lozenge (or rhombus)-shaped sheets or [...] "blanks" [...] which had been precut to shape before being fed to the <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> creasing and made ready <b>for</b> <b>folding</b> to form a rectangular enclosure. The edges of the overlapping flaps treated with a paste or adhesive and the method of securing the envelope or wrapper was a user choice. The symmetrical flap arrangement meant that it could be held together with a single wax seal at the apex of the topmost flap. (That the flaps of an envelope can be held together by applying a seal at a single point is a classic design feature of an envelope.) ...|$|R
