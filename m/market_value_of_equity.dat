Asset recognitions and revaluations are measured as components of acquisition premia generated in business combinations. Future performance is measured as subsequent-period changes in operating income and changes in operating cash flows. The paper addresses three related research questions. First, to what extent are the components of acquisition premium generated in a business combination associated with the stock price of the combined firm? Second, do the components of acquisition premium reflect changes in future performance, where performance is measured as operating income and operating cash flows? And, third, does the accounting treatment in business combinations result in differential associations of the components of acquisition premium with stock prices or changes in future performance? I find that, consistent with prior research, acquisition premia generated in business combinations are positively associated with the <b>market</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> the combined firms. Also, I find acquisition premia generated in purchase transactions are positively associated with changes in future operating income and cash flows from operations. However, acquisition premia generated in pooling transactions are not associated with changes in future performance.

Our analysis supports his conjecture regarding the decline in real after-tax debt yields, but rejects his analysis of the cause of the decline in share values. The decline in share values can be attributed to many factors, but the most important is probably the favorable taxation of income from owner-occupied housing (no taxation of either implicit rents nor real capital gains). As a result housing has become more attractive with the acceleration of inflation, and households have substituted housing for equity shares. Other possible sources of the decline in share values are reduced profitability of existing capital, owing to increased regulatory costs and real energy prices, and a greater perceived risk in business operations. ...|$|R

However, the current lease regulation is criticized and a proposed new lease standard (exposure draft) has been released. The presented changes in the new exposure draft include capitalizing all leases, which will affect companies’ financial ratios. These regulation changes may affect the market value for affected companies. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and explore the effects and possible consequences capitalizing operating leases has on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> We want to investigate if investors already adjust for capitalized operating leases in their assessment of <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD Our purpose and hypothesis is investigated by capitalizing operating leases.

The study used time series data that covered the period from 1980 to 2012. This includes the pre-Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) and SAP eras. The cointegration test with its implied ECM was applied. The ADF unit root test indicates that all the variables are stationary at I(1).
