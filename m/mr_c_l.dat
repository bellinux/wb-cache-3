5000|$|The town {{began as}} an unincorporated {{community}} known as the Old Bethel Community in the 1960s after completion of Cedar Creek Reservoir. It was incorporated in the late 1960s so it could legally sell beer and wine. The city {{takes its name from}} a former road, Gun Barrel Lane (which is now State Highway 198), as well as its motto, [...] "We Shoot Straight with You", and its symbol [...] - [...] a rifle with two crossed antique pistols. Gun Barrel Lane got its name during the 1920s and 1930s when outlaws frequented the area. It was considered a safe backwoods place during Prohibition when the likes of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker hung out in the area. A local resident, <b>Mr.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>L.</b> Wait, lived along the road and was known for sitting at the window of his house with a shotgun sticking out the window. It was his way of deterring those he deemed unwelcome on this back country road.|$|E

As there are among the skins from Fak-Fak three unlabelled specimens of Schlegelia wilsoni and among those from Kaukas one Geoffroyus personatus rhodops and two Myristicivora melanura, also unlabelled, it is quite sure, that not all the specimens are from the given localities. Of course I mention only those birds, which are provided with a label, but in some cases, regarding rare species, I mention also unlabelled specimens. From Mr. J. Henkelman we purchased a collection of birds, that are collected on the Owen Stanley Mountains, eastern New Guinea, shot above 3000 feet, some specimens on Mount Victoria at 12000 feet of altitude.

40|$|On October 23, 1903, William Temple Hornaday, the {{director}} of the New York Zoological Park, wrote to a <b>Mr</b> <b>C.</b> <b>L.</b> Williams, then responsible for ‘Hagenbeck’s Animal Show,’ which was touring the United States. At the time, the show was to be seen at the Grand Opera House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but it was missing one of its star performers, the famous lion-tiger hybrid ‘Prince’ who {{had been part of the}} show for over a decade, making his debut in the United States as part of Hagenbeck’s exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Prince was in New York instead of with the show because he was ill and it was hoped that the relative quiet and expert care available at the zoological park would help him recover. Alas, according to the letter, Prince ‘would require fully another month of convalescence’ before he would possibly be ready to ‘resume his work. ’ ‘He yet feels so much under the weather,’ Hornaday writes, ‘that he lies in his den all day and never comes out willingly. ’ In the end, Prince died in New York and Hornaday, following instructions from Williams, sent the carcass to a local taxidermist with instructions that the skin should be tanned for the purpose of making a rug, the claws should be removed, and, along with the skin, skull, and bones, sent to Williams, who could then be found at the Empire Theater in Frankford, PA...|$|E

John Ryon Jr. and his brother James settled in the center of Elkland, which became known as Ryonsville. John Ryon Sr., who joined the settlement later, was the first postmaster of the village and resided there until his death in 1832. John Ryon Jr. early became a prominent and leading spirit. He was elected a justice of the peace in 1816, a member of the legislature in 1822 and 1823, and a member of the state senate in 1824. He was the first merchant of the village and its most prominent citizen. In 1848, he removed to Lawrenceville, PA, where he died July 22, 1859.
