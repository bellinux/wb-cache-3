60|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} spots to me at that time, when my expeditions were not yet very extended, was a low-lying moist stretch of ground about {{a mile and a}} half from home, where on account of the moisture it was always a vivid green. In spring it was like a <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> in England, a perfect garden of wild flowers, and as it was liable to become flooded in wet winters it was avoided by the vizcachas, the big rodents that make their warrens or villages of huge burrows all over the plain. Here I used to go in quest {{of the most}} charming flowers which were not found in other places; one, a special favourite on account of its delicious fragrance, being the small lily called by the natives Lagrimas de la Virgin--Tears of the Virgin. Here at one spot the ground to the extent of an acre or so was occupied by one plant of a peculiar appearance, to the complete exclusion of the tall grasses and herbage in other parts. It grew in little tussocks like bushes, each plant composed of twenty or thirty stalks of a woody toughness and about two and a half feet high. The stems were thickly clothed with round leaves, soft as velvet to the touch and so dark a green that at a little distance they looked almost black against the bright green of the moist turf. Their beauty was in the blossoming season, when every stem produced its dozen or more flowers growing singly among the leaves, in size and shape like dog- roses, the petals of the purest, loveliest yellow. As the flowers grew close to the stalk, to gather them it was necessary to cut the stalk at the root with all its leaves and flowers, and this I sometimes did to take it to my mother, who had a great love of wild flowers. But no sooner would I start with a bunch of flowering stalks in my hand than the lovely delicate petals would begin to drop off, and before I was half way home there would not be a petal left. This extreme frailty or sensitiveness used to infect me with the notion that this flower was something more than a mere flower, something like a sentient being, and that it had a feeling in it which caused it to drop its shining petals and perish when removed from its parent root and home.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that global changes will pose the most important constrains to plant survival and distribution, {{our knowledge of the}} adaptive mechanism for plant with large-scale environmental changes (e. g. drought and high temperature) remains limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An experiment was conducted to examine anatomical and physiological plasticity in Leymus chinensis along a large-scale geographical gradient from 115 ° to 124 °E in northeast China. Ten sites selected for plant sampling at the gradient have approximately theoretical radiation, but differ in precipitation and elevation. The significantly increasing in leaf thickness, leaf mass per area, vessel and vascular diameters, and decreasing in stoma density and stoma index exhibited more obvious xerophil-liked traits for the species from the <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> grassland sites in contrast to that from the dry steppe and desert sites. Significant increase in proline and soluble sugar accumulation, K(+) /Na(+) for the species with the increasing of stresses along the gradient showed that osmotic adjustment was enhanced. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Obvious xerophytic anatomical traits and stronger osmotic adjustment in stress conditions suggested that the plants have much more anatomical and physiological flexibilities than those in non-stress habitats along the large-scale gradient...|$|E

40|$|Meadows are biologically diverse systems where {{a melting}} pot of hydrological, {{geologic}} and ecologic conditions cumulate. Due to their lush vegetation, water resources and cool temperature meadows have long been utilized for human use. Through neglectful practices and weather events meadows across the west have been degraded. To bring meadows back to a pristine state restoration efforts have been underway since the last half century. A common practice is ???pond and plug??? restoration. In this research, MODFLOW models are linked with Rscript to simulate the groundwater regime and foliar cover at the study site. Two versions of pond and plug restoration are simulated. These are pond and plug restoration without and with a divergent stream channel used to reconnect the meadow aquifer with surface flows. It is found that <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> cover is increased by 0. 61 and 1. 32 hectares over control conditions for the respective restoration cases and the meadow aquifer was recharged as result of restorations.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} to understand the distribution and conservation status of medicinal plants in their natural habitats, owing to their increased demand and value. We studied the distribution pattern and current conservation status of six threatened medicinal plants in Pahalgam valley, Kashmir Himalayas, by random quadrate sampling (n= 216) in different habitat types. The different uses of medicinal plants were obtained by informal interviews and group discussions with family elders.

This {{study consisted of}} two main projects: 1) an ecological study of a population of small mammals with emphasis on meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. 2) {{a study of the}} short-term response of small mammals to prescribe burning. Both populations were studied via live-trapping and telemetry. [...] The first project examined a population of small mammals on a 3. 2 ha plot established in a 9 -year-old clearcut. Three main habitat types were present in the plot: forest regeneration which comprised 89 percent of the area, and relatively small percentages of clearings and <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> patches. Three species were captured on the site during the study: meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only three Peromycus were captured over the four months of the study and Sorex were difficult to live-trap, therefore efforts were focused on meadow voles. Thirteen resident female Microtus, five adults and 8 eight juveniles, were radio-collared from June until late August 1994. [...] Survival, recruitment and density of meadow voles peaked in June and then decreased to very low numbers in the fall. Density of voles in western Newfoundland were lower than those reported for continental vole populations. Only six percent of juvenile voles showed signs of sexual maturity in the summer of their birth. Several juveniles were sixty to ninety days old and still were not reproductively active. Microtus exhibited strong preference for the <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> patches in the 9 -year-old clearcut. Seven of the eight juveniles radio-collared had a portion of their home range in the meadow habitat. Four of the five adults were located in the meadow or moist patches during excursions away from the nest. Plant species highly palatable to voles, as revealed by a food preference test, were most abundant in the small meadow areas. The highly palatable species could not be predicted by nitrogen concentration, phenol concentration or the ratio of nitrogen to phenols. The forage selection patterns of voles in western Newfoundland are still unknown. [...] Space use of female voles in this study tended to differ from other vole populations. Periphery home range size and interfix distance were larger than those reported in the literature for similar species. Core home range sizes were smaller for adult females than juveniles females in the study area. Female voles tended to travel longer distances in the late morning than early morning possibly due to increased predator activity at dawn. [...] The second project was an experimental manipulation study designed to examine the short-term response of small mammals to prescribed burning with an emphasis on the role of cover in this response. The design consisted of three treatments: prescribed burn, prescribed burn plus cover and control. Each treatment consisted of two 0. 81 ha plots established in a two year-old clearcut. All treatment plots were placed at least 75 meters apart to ensure that animals did not move between plots. Plots were established in August 1994 and trapped for a week to ensure small mammals were present in the area. In September 1994, the burn and burn plus cover treatments were burned by Newfoundland Forest Service personnel. Following the burn, the burn plus cover plots were homogeneously covered with slash consisting of branches and tree tops with no living vegetation. The two remaining plots were left unburned to serve as controls. [...] Three small mammal species were captured on the study area: meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). All species were relatively low in abundance. Almost twice as many voles were captured on the burn plus cover treatment than the burn or control treatments, however there was high variation within treatments. The length of time a vole remained on a plot did not vary between treatments. The catch per unit effort of Sorex was significantly higher on control plots than the burn or burn plus cover plots. Overall Peromyscus numbers were too low for comparisons between treatments. [...] The Braun-Blanquet method of vegetation surveying revealed that herbaceous cover and total number of plant species were significantly lower on the burn plots than the control plots. Palatable cover was lower on the control plots relative to the burn and burn plus cover plots. The only habitat variable which differed between burn and burn plus cover plots was slash cover thereby validating this study as testing for the effects of cover independantly of food.

40|$|Necromass, i. e., dead plant parts, has a {{great impact}} on the spatial {{patterns}} of populations and communities. Depending on its thickness and the degree of decomposition, it may constitute a space-blocking physical barrier and impede recruitment of individuals due to, e. g., autotoxication. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the role of the necromass layer in formation of the soil seed bank of variously <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> communities and its influence on the efficiency of generative reproduction. The authors paid special attention to the possibility of capture and storage of seeds of species occurring in the vegetation cover by necromass. Additionally, selected features of seeds of species present on the necromass were analyzed in order to identify species that can potentially contribute to formation of the necromass seed bank. 			 			The plant cover comprised 52 species in total. Seedlings of 21 taxa appeared on the necromass and their number ranged from 10 to 13, depending on the patch. The density of the seedlings ranged from 339 to 4923 m− 2. In all patches, Lythrum salicaria and Lysimachia vulgaris seedlings were most numerous. These two species were characterized by the highest frequency as well. The low values of Jaccard’s index (0. 28 – 0. 36) imply a low share of taxa that are common for the necromass and the vegetation cover. This result should be explained by the occurrence of large disproportions in the number of all species identified on the necromass and among the vegetation. The seeds are typically characterized by small sizes and usually have smooth or finely striated and/or ribbed surface texture. The presence of additional structures, e. g., pappus and hairs, in the largest and heaviest seeds (Crepis paludosa, Geum rivale, and Cirsium spp.) may help seeds capture in the necromass...|$|E

Identification Tips: The rose-pink color of the flowers is unique among Pacific Northwest species of Orthocarpus. Phenology: Flowers from June through August. Range: Vancouver Island, B. C. to Oregon, mostly west of the Cascades, southward to east of the Cascades to Plumas County, CA. In WA, it is currently known from one meadow complex in Klickitat County (Eastern Cascades physiographic province). There are also historical records from San Juan and Whatcom counties, WA (Puget Trough physiographic province). Habitat: The extant sites in WA are all associated with <b>moist</b> <b>meadow</b> conditions in the transition zone between wetland and upland. These sites are graminoid and forb dominated with little to no shrub or tree cover. Adjacent forested areas are dominated by a mixture of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. Two other rare plant species occur in the immediate vicinity: long-bearded sego lily (Calochortus longebarbatus var. longebarbatus) and Oregon coyote-thistle (Eryngium petiolatum). Ecology: Specific factors regarding the ecology of this species are unknown. Presumably the hydrologic regime is significant, given the species ’ restriction to the transition zone around wetland perimeters. All locations also receive full sunlight. Fire may have played a limited role historically in the maintenance of suitable habitat. The species can also tolerate some grazing pressure...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} temporal {{variability in}} N pools, both aboveground and belowground, across two contrasting plant communities in high-Arctic Spitsbergen, Svalbard (78 °N). We measured N pools in plant material, soil microbial biomass and {{soil organic matter}} in moist (Alopecurus borealis dominated) and dry (Dryas octopetala dominated) meadow communities at four times during the growing season. We found that plant, microbial and dissolved inorganic and organic N pools were subject to significant, but surprisingly low, temporal variation that was controlled primarily by changes in temperature and moisture availability over the short growing season. This temporal variability is much less than that experienced in other seasonally cold ecosystems such as alpine tundra where strong seasonal partitioning of N occurs between plant and soil microbial pools. While only {{a small proportion of}} the total ecosystem N, the microbial biomass represented the single largest of the dynamic N pools in both moist and dry meadow communities (3. 4 % and 4. 6 % of the total ecosystem N pool, respectively). This points to the importance of soil microbial community dynamics for N cycling in high-Arctic ecosystems. Microbial N was strongly and positively related to soil temperature in the dry meadow, but this relationship did not hold true in the wet meadow where other factors such as wetter soil conditions might constrain biological activity. Vascular live belowground plant parts represented the single largest plant N pool in both dry and <b>moist</b> <b>meadow,</b> constituting an average of 1. 6 % of the total N pool in both systems; this value did not vary across the growing season or between plant communities.

40|$|Abstract Deeper winter snow is {{hypothesized}} to favor shrub growth and may partly explain the shrub expansion observed {{in many parts}} of the arctic during the last decades, potentially triggering biophysical feedbacks including regional warming and permafrost thawing. Weexperimentally tested the effects of winter snow depth on shrub growth and ecophysiology by measuring stem length and stem hydrogen (δ 2 H), carbon (δ 13 C), nitrogen (δ 15 N) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotopic composition of the circumarctic evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona growing in high-arctic Svalbard, Norway. Measurements were carried out on C. tetragona individuals sampled from three tundra sites, each representing a distinct moisture regime (dry heath, meadow, <b>moist</b> <b>meadow).</b> Individuals were sampled along gradients of experimentally manipulated winter snow depths in a six-year old snow fence experiment: in ambient (c. 20 cm), medium (c. 100 cm), and deep snow (c. 150 cm) plots. The deep-snow treatment consistently and significantly increased C. tetragona growth during the 2008 – 2011 manipulation period compared to growth in ambient-snow plots. Stem δ 15 Nand stemN concentration values were significantly higher in deep-snow individuals compared to individuals growing in ambient-snow plots during the course of the experiment, suggesting that soil N-availability was increased in deep-snow plots as a result of increased soil winterNmineralization. Although interannual growing season-precipitation δ 2 Hand stem δ 2 Hrecords closely matched, snow depth did not change stem δ 2 Hor δ 18 O, suggesting that water source usage by C. tetragona was unaltered. Instead, the deep insulating snowpack may have protected C. tetragona shrubs against frost damage, potentially compensating the detrimental effects of a shortened growing season and associated phenological delay on growth. Our findings suggest that an increase in winter precipitation in the High Arctic, as predicted by climate models, has the potential to alter the growth and ecophysiology of evergreen shrub C. tetragona through changes in plant mineral nutrition and frost damage protection...|$|E
