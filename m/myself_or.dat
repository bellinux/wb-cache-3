[...] Borland explained why he left Limp Bizkit; he said: [...] "I could have probably gone on and still played the part of the guitar player of Limp Bizkit, but musically I was kind of bored.

Pompeo heavily criticised media reports {{suggesting}} that she suffered from an eating disorder, calling the media irresponsible for promoting such rumours. In a 2007 issue of Los Angeles Confidential Magazine, she said that she was worried about the young girls who look up to her: [...] "I don’t want them to think I starve <b>myself</b> <b>or</b> don’t eat, and that to be like me that’s what they have to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Walker {{had thought}} he was in mid-stream when he issued the order. In fact, he was about seven leagues (about [...] ) north of his proper course, and in the grasp of strong {{currents}} which steered his ships towards the northwest. [...] Propelled by an easterly wind, the fleet was gradually closing on the north-south shore near Île-aux-Oeufs. [...] When Captain Paddon reported to Walker that land had been sighted around 10:30 pm, presumably dead ahead, Walker assumed that the fleet was approaching the south shore, and ordered the fleet to wear, and bring-to on the other tack, {{before he went to}} bed. [...] This manoeuvre put the fleet onto a more northerly heading. [...] Some minutes later, an army captain named Goddard roused Walker, claiming to see breakers ahead. [...] Walker dismissed the advice and the man, but Goddard returned, insisting that the admiral [...] "come upon deck <b>myself,</b> <b>or</b> we should certainly be lost".|$|E
500|$|However, {{near the}} end of development, time {{constraints}} led the Pickford brothers to sell Zippo Games to Rare, in which Zippo was renamed Rare Manchester. With Rare as their boss, morale dropped for the development staff, and eventually everyone left the company before the game could be completed, thus shutting Rare Manchester down. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "One of the programmers completed the game himself after the studio closed." [...] Pickford included a cover, which consisted of a knight in a light-blue armor, in which he said [...] "was just something I drew for fun". However, when {{the final version of the}} game was sent to Rare for approval after the studio's closing, they threw away the cover and added their own. According to Pickford, [...] "The document came back with about two typos fixed, a new cover, and 'revised by Tim Stamper' in big letters on the title page, with all trace of <b>myself</b> <b>or</b> any of the Zippo Games names removed, so I guess Tim had a major role." [...] The game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released in North America in March1992 and in Europe on January21, 1993.|$|E

500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat <b>myself</b> <b>or</b> make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as <b>myself</b> <b>or</b> anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

500|$|Persona 4 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from game critics upon release. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb {{described it as}} [...] "one of the best times I've had with video games, whether I was playing by <b>myself</b> <b>or</b> watching someone else play it." [...] Famitsu pointed out that while [...] "there isn't much new from the last game", it favored the changes over the battle system, where the pacing [...] "is quick so it doesn't {{get to be a}} pain", and the ability to control party members [...] "makes play that much easier". IGN on the other hand noted that [...] "the pacing can be somewhat off", and [...] "some things feel repurposed or unaffected from previous games", while praising the game as an [...] "evolution of the RPG series, and an instant classic". It also noted that the soundtrack can be [...] "a bit repetitive". RPGFan's Ryan Mattich recommended Persona 4 as [...] "one of the best RPG experiences of the year", noting that [...] "among the cookie-cutter sequels and half-hearted remakes", the game is [...] "a near flawless example of the perfect balance between 'falling back on what works' and 'pushing the genre forward'." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch summarized Persona 4 as [...] "some of this decade's finest RPG epics", although the reviewer criticized its [...] "slight loading issues" [...] and the time spent [...] "waiting for the plot to advance". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.3, stating it's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role-playing genre, and that it stands out of any other JRPG, including its predecessor, Persona 3. Wired pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, [...] "the clever art style makes up for that". It also praised the game's soundtrack as [...] "excellent, especially the battle music".|$|E
