5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring.

5|$|Colen Campbell was {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture.

His architectural style did incorporate Palladian elements, as well as forms from Italian baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by the interpretation of the Baroque by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E

Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{statistical}} analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his {{ten years in}} the major leagues and at virtually every position he played.

Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.|$|E
5|$|Irving Isadore Gottesman (December 29, 1930 – June 29, 2016) was an American {{professor}} of psychology who devoted <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>career</b> {{to the study of}} the genetics of schizophrenia.

He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{abilities}} as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The ICC player rankings {{have been applied}} retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth {{in the world in}} 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début {{and for the rest of}} the duration of his career. Miller's bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in the world according to the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956. As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>career,</b> ranked as number one in the world for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>career,</b> including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.|$|E
