40|$|Acute bovine liver disease, which <b>causes</b> <b>photosensitisation</b> {{and sudden}} death in dairy cattle in the {{southern}} parts of Australia, has been tentatively associated {{with the presence of}} Cynosurus echinatus L. (rough dog’s tail) in the pasture. Also tentatively implicated is the known phytopathogenic fungus Drechslera biseptata that has been isolated from C. echinatus collected at the time of, and from the sites of, outbreaks of acute bovine liver disease. Aqueous and hexane extracts of in vitro cultures of D. biseptata caused binucleation of cultured rat hepatocytes whereas the methanolic extracts caused severe degeneration and necrosis. A methanolic extract of entire C. echinatus collected from a toxic paddock showed the same degenerative toxic effect on the cultured rat hepatocytes. High pressure liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated hepatocytotoxic metabolites indicated the possibility of cytochalasin-like compounds. M. R. Aslani, I.

40|$|The {{bladders}} of anaesthetised mice were illuminated {{with red}} laser light (630 nm) at intervals of 1 day to 4 weeks after i. p. administration of Photofrin. Light was delivered intravesically by inserting a fibre optic, with a diffusing bulb tip, into {{the centre of}} fluid filled bladders. A single light dose of 11. 3 J cm- 2 applies 1 day after 10 mg kg- 1 Photofrin caused a severe acute response, with increased urination frequency (five to seven times control) and hematuria. Recovery was good, however, and by 10 weeks only a mild (approximately two-fold) increase in frequency remained. There was no reduction {{in the amount of}} acute bladder damage or in the rate of healing when the interval between Photofrin and light was increased from 1 to 7 days but a 2 to 3 week interval lead to a significant reduction in damage. For an interval of 4 weeks there was only a mild (less than two-fold) increase in urination frequency during the first week. A drug dose of 2. 5 mg kg- 1 given 1 day before illumination caused transient haematuria but no increase in urination frequency. Doses of 5, 7. 5 or 10 mg kg- 1 all <b>caused</b> <b>photosensitisation</b> and the amount of bladder damage was drug dose dependent.
