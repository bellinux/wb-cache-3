5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are restricted to Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their own hands. Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E
5|$|Seneb {{was buried}} in a mastaba - a flat-roofed brick tomb – located in the West Field of the Giza Necropolis near modern Cairo, where a large complex of ancient Egyptian royal tombs and {{mortuary}} structures was built, including the Great Pyramid. It was rediscovered by the German archaeologist Hermann Junker in 1926. The tomb is situated close to that of another dwarf, Perniankhu, a high-ranking royal courtier {{who may have been}} Seneb's father. Its date was long uncertain but is now firmly attributed to the reign of Djedefre (2528–2520 BC). His wife's name also appears in the nearby tomb of an official, Ankh-ib, suggesting that the families of Seneb, Perniankhu and Ankh-ib may have been related. Seneb was apparently buried with his wife, but no trace remains of the bodies, and the tomb was looted long ago, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> at Giza. It {{was one of the first}} known attempts at building a ceiling dome over a square chamber, with the dome resting on jutting bricks at the corners of the room.|$|E

5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E
5|$|Prominent Swedish {{entomologist}} Carl Stål {{named the}} genus Abricta in 1866, {{and it was}} either treated as a subgenus of the genus Tibicen or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as Tibicen curvicostus, and Abricta curvicosta from 1906. French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada tephrogaster (later Tibicen tephrogaster) in 1835; this has long been considered a junior synonym. However, {{a review of the}} genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14species, and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were placed in the genus Tryella. The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors: A.curvicosta has a larger forewing size– rarely less than 3.2cm (1.3in) and usually over 4cm (1.6in), whereas Tryella is never above 3.2cm (1.3in); the uncal lobes of Aleetas distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of Tryella are upturned. The name Aleeta is derived from the Greek aleton meaning flour or meal.|$|E

Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs.
