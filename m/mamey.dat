25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Americas brought {{to the rest of}} the world many widely used food crops and edible plants. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: chocolate, avocado, tomato, maize, vanilla, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, <b>mamey</b> sapote, many varieties of beans, and an even greater variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like Nahuatl.|$|E
25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and textile materials. By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or Breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, <b>mamey,</b> zapote, and annona.|$|E
2500|$|A small {{habitat in}} the state is the Huasteca {{highland}} rainforest. It has plants blooming nearly year-round. Forests include tree species such as: “Tlacuilo,” [...] Oaks (Quercus species), Copaifera, “Zuchiate,” Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), and Mexican white cedar (Cupressus lusitanica). The area {{has one of the}} widest varieties of wild birds including eagles, hummingbirds, and wild turkeys. Reptiles include a wide variety of snakes, and mammals include coyotes, bobcats, wild boar, spotted deer, and rabbits. Tropical crops raised here include sugar cane, coconuts, pineapple, bananas, <b>mamey,</b> and tamarind.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with corn}} and beans grown for subsistence, other fruits and {{vegetables}} are widely grown. These include bananas, cherimoyas, <b>mameys,</b> melons, cucumbers, tomatillos, jicama, squash, alfalfa, cotton, peanuts, onions and tomatoes. Many crops are grown for autoconsumption, especially in indigenous areas. The state is working to help shift agriculture production from the traditional corn and beans, which can be imported cheaper, to other products such as apricots, which {{have been shown to}} make money. Livestock mostly consists of cattle, pigs, horses and domestic fowl. There is some fish farming in the state, mostly of mojarra and tilapia in Rodeo and Zacatepec.|$|R

60|$|Of course I shall go to Doncaster, {{whether or}} no (please God), and my postage {{directions}} to you remain unchanged. Love to <b>Mamey,</b> Katey, Charley, Harry, and the darling Plorn.|$|E
60|$|If Kate has not {{mentioned}} it, get Katey and <b>Mamey</b> {{to write and}} {{send a letter to}} Charley; of course not hinting at our being here. He wants to hear from them.|$|E
60|$|Kiss {{the darling}} Plorn, who is often in my thoughts. Best love to Charley, <b>Mamey,</b> and Katie. I will write {{to you again}} from Doncaster, where I shall be rejoiced to find another letter from you.|$|E

60|$|Kate {{sends her}} tender love; so does Georgy, so does Charlie, so does <b>Mamey,</b> so does Katey, so does Walter, {{so does the}} other one who is to be born next week. Look homeward always, as we look abroad to you. God bless you, my dear Macready.|$|E
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} hear {{that you are going}} to improve in your spelling, because nobody can write {{properly}} without spelling well. But I know you will learn whatever you are taught, because you are always good, industrious, and attentive. That is what I always say of my <b>Mamey.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As {{the reading}} comes off to-morrow night, I had better not {{despatch}} my letters to you until Wednesday's post. I must close {{to save this}} (heartily tired I am, and I dine at Gore House to-day), so with love to Georgy, <b>Mamey,</b> Katey, Charley, Wally, and Chickenstalker, ever, believe me, ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{anxious to}} hear that you reached Genoa quite comfortably, and shall look forward with impatience to that letter which you are to indite with so much care and pains next Monday. My best love to Georgy, and to Charley, and <b>Mamey,</b> and Katey, and Wally, and Chickenstalker. I have treated myself to a new travelling-cap to-night (my old one being too thin), and it is rather a prodigious affair I flatter myself.|$|E
60|$|Best {{love from}} both of us, to Charley, <b>Mamey,</b> Katey, Wally, Chickenstalker, Skittles, and the Hoshen Peck; last, and not least, to you. We talked of you at the Macreadys' party on Monday night. I hope ---- came out lively, also that ---- was truly amiable. Finally, that ---- took {{everybody}} to their carriages, and that ---- wept a good deal during the festivities? God bless you. Take care of yourself, {{for the sake of}} mankind in general.|$|E
60|$|My best love to <b>Mamey</b> and Katey, and Sydney {{the king}} of the nursery, and Harry and the dear little Plornishghenter. I kiss almost all the {{children}} I encounter in remembrance of their sweet faces, and talk to all the mothers who carry them. I hope to hear nothing but good news from you, and to find nothing but good spirits in your expected letter when I come to Rome. I already begin to look homeward, being now at the remotest part of the journey, and to anticipate the pleasure of return.|$|E
60|$|We find a let of {{two hundred}} stalls here, which is very large for this place. The evening being fine too, and blue being {{to be seen in}} the sky beyond the smoke, we expect to have a very full hall. Tell <b>Mamey</b> and Katey that if they had been with us on the railway to-day between Leamington and this place, they would have seen (though it is only an hour and ten minutes by the express) fires and smoke indeed. We came through a part of the Black Country that you know, and it looked at its blackest. All the {{furnaces}} seemed in full blast, and all the coal-pits to be working.|$|E
60|$|I am {{beginning}} {{to think of the}} Birmingham readings. I suppose you won't object to be taken to hear them? This is the last place at which we shall make a stay of more than one day. We shall stay at Parma one, and at Turin one, supposing De la Rue to have been successful in taking places with the courier into France for the day on which we want them (he was to write to bankers at Turin to do it), and then we shall come hard and fast home. I feel almost there already, and shall be delighted to close the pleasant trip, and get back to my own Piccola Camera--if, being English, you understand what that is. My best love and kisses to <b>Mamey,</b> Katey, Sydney, Harry, and the noble Plorn. Last, not least, to yourself, and many of them. I will not wait over to-morrow, tell Kate, for her letter; but will write then, whether or no.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall be}} glad to think of your all being at home again, as I suppose you will be soon after the receipt of this. Will you see to the invitations for Christmas Day, and write to Lætitia? I shall be {{very happy to be}} at home again myself, and to embrace you; for of course I miss you very much, though I feel that I could not have done a better thing to clear my mind and freshen it up again, than make this expedition. If I find Charley much ahead of me, I shall start on through a night or so to meet him, and leave the others to catch us up. I look upon the journey as almost closed at Turin. My best love to <b>Mamey,</b> and Katey, and Sydney, and Harry, and the darling Plornishghenter. We often talk about them, and both my companions do so with interest. They always send all sorts of {{messages}} to you, which I never deliver. God bless you! Take care of yourself.|$|E
