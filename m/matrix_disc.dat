40|$|The {{success of}} fresh-frozen {{intervertebral}} disc allograft transplantation {{in the human}} cervical spine has opened up a new dimension {{in the treatment of}} disc degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, technical improvements are still needed, because a mild degeneration of the postoperative disc allograft has been found. The course and aetiology of disc allograft degeneration are unclear, but loss of nutrient supply is likely {{one of the most important}} factors. This is because the disc allografts are immersed in the ischaemic environment until the nutrient pathway is re-established. Understanding the nutrient reestablishment and the degenerative profile of the postoperative disc allograft is essential for the development of reparative strategies. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the reestablishment of the nutrient pathway and its role in the degeneration of the postoperative disc allograft. All of the experiments were performed in the goat lumbar spine. A surgical technique for disc allografting was developed; the heights of the postoperative disc allograft and its adjacent levels, as well as the segmental and global mobility, were measured to validate the feasibility of the goat model. Second, the reestablishment of nutrient pathway in the postoperative disc allograft was determined by healing of the host–graft interfaces, remodelling of the endplates and the revascularisation at 1. 5, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. Third, the degenerative process of the disc allograft during the reestablishment of the nutrient pathway was evaluated through gross morphology, cell behaviours and the extracellular <b>matrix.</b> <b>Disc</b> allografting without internal fixation was successfully performed in the goat lumbar spine. Motion preservation and reduction of the disc allograft height were found after 12 months; this closely resembled what has been observed in human cases. Thus, this model was suitable for subsequent experiments. As the prerequisite to the stability of lumbar spine and the reestablishment of the nutrient pathway, healing of the host–graft interfaces was completed after 6 months. Nevertheless, alteration of the nutrient transportation pattern was seen because the bony endplate was replaced by trabecular bone and the cartilaginous endplate basically disappeared; the other reason for this was that host blood vessels were seen surrounding the cartilaginous centre after 12 months. Furthermore, a time lag for nutrient reestablishment was evident according to the process of revascularisation and the remodelling of the endplates. Therefore, the re-established nutrition pattern of the disc allograft differed significantly from that in normal discs. This re-established nutrient pathway ensured the viability of the disc allograft, but led to structural remodelling. After 12 months, the gelatinous nucleus was replaced by the regenerated fibrocartilage and enclosed by the disorganised annulus connecting the adjacent vertebral bodies to form a “bone-fibrocartilage- bone” structure. Although a transplanted disc allograft was able to provide adequate stability and mobility of the lumbar spine for clinical function, it was histologically far from being normal. This could be partly caused by the ischaemic insult until the nutrient pathway is re-established through the endplates. Future research should therefore focus on how to enhance nutrition delivery postoperatively. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Mouse disc organotypic culture grown at atmospheric oxygen (20 % O(2)) exhibited perturbed <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> homeostasis, including reduced proteoglycan synthesis and enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinases, compared to discs grown at low oxygen levels (5 % O(2)).

Treatment of disc cells with the mitochondria-targeted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger XJB- 5 - 131 blunted the adverse effects caused by 20 % O(2). Importantly, we demonstrated that treatment of accelerated aging Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice, previously established to be a useful in vivo model to study age-related intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), also resulted in improved disc total glycosaminoglycan content and proteoglycan synthesis. This demonstrates that mitochondrial-derived ROS contributes to age-associated IDD in Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Quantitative MR analysis has been previously shown to reflect not only the <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> composition, but also the {{structural integrity}} of the <b>disc</b> <b>matrix.</b> Further work is required to identify {{the contribution of the}} structural integrity versus the matrix composition to the MR signal.

RESULTS: Collagenase degradation of the NP significantly decreased the relaxation times, slightly decreased the magnetization transfer ratio, and slightly increased the apparent diffusion coefficient. Targeting the proteoglycan and/or hyaluronan integrity by trypsin and hyaluronidase did not significantly affect the MR parameters, except for an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient of the disc after trypsin treatment.

40|$|Introduction: Loss of {{intervertebral}} <b>disc</b> (IVD) <b>matrix</b> {{and ultimately}} <b>disc</b> height {{as a result}} of 'degeneration' has been implicated as a major cause of low back pain (LBP). The use of anabolic growth factors as therapies to regenerate IVD <b>matrix,</b> hence restoring <b>disc</b> height and thus reversing degenerative disc disease, has been suggested. Cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein (CDMP) is a growth factor which stimulates proteoglycan production in chondrocyte-like cells and thus could be a useful growth factor for LBP therapies. However, {{little is known about the}} expression of CDMP or its receptor in human IVD, nor its effects on human disc cells. Methods: Using immunohistochemistry we investigated the localisation of CDMP in non-degenerate and degenerate human IVDs. Additionally, we investigated the effect of CDMP on aggrecan and type II collagen gene expression and proteoglycan synthesis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells derived from degenerate IVDs. Results: We demonstrated that CDMP 1 and 2 were expressed in the non-degenerate and degenerate IVD, particularly in cells of the NP. A small decrease in the number of CDMP 1 and 2 immunopositive cells was seen with degeneration. Treatment of human NP cells, (derived from degenerate IVD), with CDMP showed an increase in aggrecan and type II collagen gene expression and increased production of proteoglycan (GAGs). Conclusions: The data suggests that CDMP may be a useful growth factor to stimulate proteoglycan production in the human degenerate IVD and hence the repair of the extracellular matrix...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} to complement the declining population of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) found in a degenerative intervertebral disc. Although able to stop degeneration, they could not produce enough matrix to restore a healthy state. Looking at development, when {{a large amount of}} matrix is produced, the disc also contains notochordal cells (NCs), potential progenitors or regulators of NPCs. The aim of the study was, therefore, to combine NCs to a BMSC/NPC mix and evaluate their effects on cell phenotype and matrix production, in long-term culture. Methods: In a 3 D hydrogel, NCs were co-cultured in different ratios with BMSCs and/or NPCs. Matrix production, cell morphology, and gene expression of disc markers were assessed after 4 weeks of culture. Results: At day 28, BMSCs/NPCs highly expressed <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> markers (type II collagen and aggrecan) and produced <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> up to 30 % of values obtained for the positive control (BMSCs under TGFß stimulation). The addition of NCs only slightly up-regulated marker expression (6 - 12 x increase); an up-regulation not reflected at the matrix level. During the 4 weeks of culture, however, the NC phenotype changed drastically (morphology, disc marker expression). Conclusion: In contrast to previously reported short-term studies, long-term co-cultures with NCs had no substantial effects on BMSCs and NPCs, most likely due to the loss of the NC native phenotype during culture. It, therefore, appears critical to maintain this specific phenotype for a long-term effect of the NCs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Effects on cell proliferation, <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> production (proteoglycans, collagens) and <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> protein expression (aggrecan, collagen 1 and 2, SOX 9) were determined and compared to TGFß stimulation. NCCM strongly promoted NPC proliferation (× 2. 2) and matrix production (× 3. 9) to levels similar to that with TGFß, whereas the direct addition of NCs had no effect. Co-culture of NPCs and BMSCs led to proteoglycan synthesis similar to NPCs alone, which was slightly improved by NCCM (× 1. 5). Histological analysis confirmed biochemical data. Gene expression of analysed proteins remained stable for all groups and unaffected by medium conditions. NCs could substantially stimulate NPCs through factors secreted into conditioned medium and in levels similar to the addition of BMSCs.

In the fetal vertebral column, type X collagen was strongly expressed in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the endplate, but was not seen in other areas.

Cells were isolated from the nucleus of bovine discs and from bovine articular cartilage, embedded in alginate beads and cultured at pH levels maintained within the ranges seen in normal and pathological discs: pH 7. 4 -pH 6. 3 for 48 h. Rates of sulphated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and protein synthesis were measured, as well as rates of production of some agents involved in matrix breakdown, i. e. total and activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs).

40|$|Poster PresentationConference Theme: The Extracellular <b>Matrix</b> NicheIntervertebral <b>disc</b> (IVD) {{degeneration}} is a world-wide {{health problem}} and its aetiology is multifactorial with genetic and environmental factors. The IVD {{is a highly}} specialised niche, and contains a nucleus pulposus (NP) rich in proteoglycans (PG) and water, surrounded by a collagenous annulus fibrosis (AF). During IVD degeneration, there is a loss of <b>disc</b> <b>matrix,</b> water, and cells from the NP which results in structural changes to the disc, ultimately altering its function {{and can lead to}} low back pain. In this study, we systematically analysed changes in the matrix proteins in relation to aging and IVD degeneration. Ethics was approved by the IRB, and clinical IVD samples were obtained with patient consent. The AF and NP were dissected from degenerated and non-degenerated samples. Proteins were extracted with 4 M GuHCl buffer, fractionated using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, and separated into soluble/insoluble fractions. Proteins were trypsin digested, labeled with iTRAQ reagents for quantitative analysis using LCMS/MS, and identified using ProteinPilot 4. 0. Seven controls were compared to identify age-related changes. In the AF, collagen type I (soluble fraction) and types II and XI (soluble and insoluble fractions) showed a decreasing trend with age. In the NP, type II collagen had a decreasing trend, but in younger controls, was accompanied with increased type I collagen, suggesting a shift in collagen composition. An increasing trend with age was observed for PGs, including decorin, lumican and PRELP (AF and NP), as well as biglycan and mimecan in NP. Seven degenerated samples were compared to controls. Many identified proteins in the degenerated samples showed similar patterns with the controls, indicating that aging and degeneration may involve similar processes. Younger, degenerated samples had elevated levels of lumican, type II collagen, and particularly type I collagen in the NP (insoluble). Older, degenerated IVD had increased aggrecan, decorin and PRELP in the AF (insoluble fraction). Aging and degeneration shared some similarities, as well as differences in the static protein profile. Reduced collagen during degeneration may correlate to decreased tensile strength and fibrotic appearances of degenerated tissues. The differing proteins may aid in understanding the processes involved in aging and degeneration. Further studying of the dynamics of IVD cells in protein production may be achieved with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), which would identify actively synthesised proteins and further elucidate the cellular functions in the IVD...|$|R

40|$|Poster PresentationConference Theme: The Extracellular <b>Matrix</b> NicheIntervertebral <b>discs</b> (IVDs) are {{structures}} connecting {{vertebral bodies}} {{to form the}} spine. Each consists of a central gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP), surrounded peripherally by a tough annulus fibrosus (AF), and flanked on either end by an endplate (EP). They confer flexibility and weight-bearing property to the spine. IVD cells are crucial in maintenance of the <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> and its proper function. Changes in IVD cellular differentiation, determined by their surrounding microenvironment, may disrupt this homeostasis, hence destroying disc function. Current studies {{are focused on the}} cellular outcome associated with degradative changes in microenvironment, yet little is known of the relation between normal matrix turnover and IVD cells. A mouse with an altered degradation site in type II collagen (Col 2 a 1 cr/cr) exhibits a cartilage matrix less susceptible to degradation (Gauci, 2008). Given Col 2 a 1 is highly expressed in the IVD, a similar reduction of its turnover is expected in the discs of this mouse. We thus utilize the mouse to address whether cellular changes would result from this. Metachromatic histological analysis (Leung, 2009) is performed on IVD sections at different stages from neonatal (P 10) to maturity (1 year). The mutant IVD is histologically similar to the wild type at newborn, but changes are observed at later stages. While a boney EP is already formed in the wild type at 6 weeks, the mutant maintained a cartilaginous EP with chondrocyte-like cells until 6 months, when signs of ossification appeared (Fig. A). Changes in alcian blue staining pattern indicates altered glycoprotein distribution in the inner AF, and the residing cells are more rounded and chondrocyte-like (Fig. B). These changes demonstrate the decreased Col II turnover could lead to cellular differentiation and subsequent morphology differences. Maintenance of IVD cells is dependent on the matrix homeostasis. Our results suggested that impairment of Col II turnover may disturb this balance and influence the differentiation of IVD cells. The effect becomes pronounced at later stages of development. This may be due to gradual accumulation of mutant Col II, altering the matrix composition and subsequently interferes with the IVD cell fate. Modifications of metabolite flow resulting from the structural change of EP in mutant could also contribute to the observed outcome. Staining for molecular markers such as Sox 9 and brachyury will better characterize the cellular changes involved. Our work gives implication on the role of matrix turnover in the maintenance of IVD cells...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty-nine discs from cadaveric lumbar spines were {{injected}} {{with a mixture}} of radio-opaque fluid and dye. Discograms were taken and the discs were then sectioned in the sagittal plane. Examination of the sections revealed that injected fluid did not at first mix with the <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> but pushed it aside to form pools of injected fluid. The location of these pools, and hence the appearance of a discogram, depended on the stage of degeneration of the disc. It is concluded that useful clinical information can be obtained from discograms. The usefulness ofdiscography has not been satisfactorily established. Certain types of “abnormal ” discogram are characteristic of patients with low back pain (Feinberg 1964; Fraser et a!. 1983) and are relatively uncommon in asymptomatic volunteers (Holt 1968). Unfortunately, the fact that abnormal discograms sometimes occur in asymptomatic people has led to discography being dismissed as being an unreliable diag-nostic test (Holt 1968). However, it is likely that disco...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Victor decided to {{demolish}} their Camden warehouse. This warehouse held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most {{of them were}} pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer <b>discs,</b> <b>matrix</b> ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. A {{few days before the}} demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon after, collectors and RCA Records officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was demolished, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, when the company decided to release all of Rachmaninoff's recordings on LPs (to celebrate the centennial of the composer's birth), RCA was forced to go to record collectors for materials, as documented by Time.|$|R
40|$|Objective—To assess {{therapeutic}} {{benefits for}} intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>matrix</b> repair and regeneration, the potential synergism of IGF- 1 and BMP 7 on bovine spine discs were evaluated, and molecular/ cellular mechanisms were elucidated. Methods—Bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) cells {{were treated with}} BMP 7 and IGF- 1. The subsequent anabolic effects driven by NP cells were assessed for proteoglycan synthesis by 35 S-sulfate incorporation and accumulation by DMMB assays, respectively. Matrix formation was visualized by particle exclusion assay. Key matrix components and transcription factors were analyzed by real-time PCR to determine the signaling pathways by which IGF- 1 suppresses noggin, a potent inhibitor of BMP 7. Western blot and nuclear translocalization experiments were performed to assess the activation of SMAD proteins. Results—Stimulation of bovine NP cells by both IGF- 1 and BMP 7 greatly potentiates anabolism through complementary and synergistic mechanisms on matrix formation when compared to treatment with either growth factor alone. Exogenously added decoy ligand, noggin attenuates the anabolic effects of BMP 7, and noggin is substantially increased by BMP 7, suggesting a negativ...|$|R
