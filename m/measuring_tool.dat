2500|$|As Shari’ah {{considers}} {{money to}} be a <b>measuring</b> <b>tool</b> for value and not an asset in itself, it requires that one should not receive income from money (or anything that has the genus of money) alone, as this (simplistically, interest) is [...] "riba", and forbidden. [...] From a Sharia perspective, certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value (although a different view is held by many in Malaysia).|$|E
2500|$|A {{report issued}} by the Economic Policy Institute in August 2010 {{recognized}} that [...] "American public schools generally do {{a poor job of}} systematically developing and evaluating teachers" [...] but expressed concern that using performance on standardized tests as a <b>measuring</b> <b>tool</b> will not lead to better performance. The EPI report recommends that measures of performance based on standardized test scores be one factor among many that should be considered to [...] "provide a more accurate view of what teachers in fact do in the classroom and how that contributes to student learning." [...] The study called value-added modeling a fairer means of comparing teachers that allows for better measures of educational methodologies and overall school performance, but argued that student test scores were not sufficiently reliable as a means of making [...] "high-stakes personnel decisions".|$|E

2500|$|This {{also leads}} to {{understanding}} a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are [...] "nowhere differentiable". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot {{be measured in}} traditional ways. To elaborate, in {{trying to find the}} length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some <b>measuring</b> <b>tool</b> small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.|$|E
2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a <b>measuring</b> <b>tool.</b> [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, but oh so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E

Further study of possible use of up to <b>measure</b> <b>tool</b> in machining other types of threads is an urgent task, the realization of which is necessary to determine of parameters of tool diameter and its motion trajectory. The real cross-section profiles of the thread were determined by graphical method. Analytical method derived mathematical expressions that bind the pitch and thread shape with the tool dimensions and machining equipment settings. The nominal diameters of up to <b>measure</b> <b>tool</b> radius and spiral trajectory of its motion for the metric, inch and a round thread was defined.
