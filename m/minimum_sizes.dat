5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational <b>minimum</b> <b>sizes</b> and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{families}} of attractive shells (such as cones, cowries, marginellas, and murex) are particularly favoured by collectors. World record size shells (commonly {{indicated by the}} acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices. Collections of such shells are exhibited {{at a number of}} specialist museums, including the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>sizes</b> are also of interest to malacologists, and may be useful in delimiting closely related species. As an extensive compilation of maximum shell sizes, the registry has found use as a data source for scientific studies.|$|E
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or <b>minimum</b> <b>sizes,</b> have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} legal {{restrictions}} {{apply to the}} catching of Cancer pagurus. It is illegal to catch [...] "berried" [...] crabs (females carrying eggs), but since ovigerous females remain in pits dug in the sediment and do not feed, fishing pressure {{does not affect the}} supply of larvae. Minimum landing sizes (MLS) for C. pagurus are set by both the European Union technical regulations and by the UK government. Different <b>minimum</b> <b>sizes</b> are employed in different geographical areas, to reflect differences in the crab's growth rate across its range. In particular, the [...] "Cromer crab" [...] fishery along the coasts of Suffolk, Norfolk and Lincolnshire is subject to a MLS of , rather than the [...] MLS in most of the species' range. An intermediate value of [...] is used {{in the rest of the}} North Sea between the 56th parallel north and the Essex–Kent border, and in the Irish Sea south of 55° N. Around Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, there is a separate MLS for males (...) and females (...) [...] The Norwegian catch is 8,500 tons annually, compared to 20,000 tons in the United Kingdom, 13,000 tons in Ireland, 8,500 tons in France, and a total 45,000 tons globally.|$|E

40|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>size</b> limits {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} popular management tool in recreational fisheries. This popularity stems from the potential of <b>minimum</b> <b>size</b> limits to accomplish the twin goals of limiting overfishing and improving fishing quality through increasing the average size of fish caught. The success of <b>minimum</b> <b>size</b> limits in achieving these objectives depends in a complicated way on both the behavior of anglers and the biological mechanisms that guide {{the growth of the}} fish population.
