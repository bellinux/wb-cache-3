Implications of these results on the energy landscape of the future were discussed. Policy options to facilitate wind energy industrial growth were explored...|$|R
40|$|The {{world and}} its peoples are facing multiple, complex {{challenges}} and we cannot continue as we are (Moss, 2010). Earth‘s “natural capital” - nature‘s ability to provide essential ecosystem services to stabilize world climate systems, maintain water quality, support secure food production, supply energy needs, <b>moderate</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> and ensure social harmony and equity – is seriously compromised (Gough, 2005; Hawkins, Lovins & Lovins, 1999). To further summarize, current rates of resource consumption by the global human population are unsustainable (Kitzes, Peller, Goldfinger & Wackernagel, 2007) for human and non-human species, and for future generations. Further, continuing growth in world population and global political commitment to growth economics compounds these demands. Despite growing recognition of the serious consequences for people and planet, little consideration is given, within most nations, to the social and environmental issues that economic growth brings. For example, Australia is recognised {{as one of the}} developed countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Yet, to date, responses (such as carbon pricing) have been small-scale, fragmented, and their worth disputed, even ridiculed. This is at a time referred to as ‘the critical decade’ (Hughes & McMichael, 2011) when the world’s peoples must make strong choices if we are to avert the worst impacts of climate change...|$|R
40|$|What is Phytoremediation? Phytoremediation {{is the use}} {{of plants}} to reduce {{environmental}} risks due to contaminants in soil, sediment, surface water, and ground water. The plants may remove, transfer, stabilize, or destroy contaminants depending {{on the nature of the}} plants and contaminants. Phytoremediation includes all biological, chemical, and physical processes influenced by plants, including processes in the root zone (rhizosphere). Phytoremediation is usually an in situ or “in place” remediation process. At brownfields, phytoremediation is most useful in addressing low to <b>moderate</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> by: 1) removing organics and salts in surface soils; 2) stabilizing metals, other contaminants, and soil; and 3) controlling and removing contaminants in surface and groundwater. The most important factors for successful use of phytoremediation are: anticipated land use, size, shape and redevelopment timing for a site; contaminant levels; cost; and natural conditions needed for plant growth. How does Phytoremediation Work? There are different mechanisms by which phytoremediation works. These mechanisms include phytoextraction, rhizosphere biodegradation, phytostabilization, and hydraulic control of ground water. Phytoextraction {{is the use of}} plants to remove contaminants from soil, sediment, or water into the above-ground plant tissue. Subsequently, the contaminants may be concentrated and remain stored in the plant tissues. This is called phytoaccumulation. Some plants are very tolerant of certain contaminants. These hyperaccumulators can uptake more contaminant mass than “normal ” plants. Examples of hyperaccumultaors are: barley, hydrangea, rapeseed, sunflower, tall fescue. For a list of hyperaccumultors for certain metals and radionuclides go t...|$|R

40|$|As issues {{concerning}} "circular economy" and "sustainable development" have been advocated globally, the recycling, reuse, recovery or disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) have gained {{more and more}} attention. Toxic substances and wasted resources within ELVs make evaluating the sustainability of ELV recycling enterprises to be especially important for sound ELV management. In this study, an improved emergy analysis with traditional and revised emergy indices was employed for evaluation of the efficiency and sustainability of ELV recycling enterprises. The constructed emergy indicator system not only reflected the ELV recycling system's resource, environmental, economic and technological efficiency, but also made a multi-scale and multi-dimensional evaluation of the system according to its industrial characteristics. An ELV recycling enterprise in Jiangxi Province, China, as a case, was studied employing the proposed method and indicator system. The {{results showed that the}} enterprise involved in the study had strong competitive ability with relatively high economic benefit, and had a <b>moderate</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> compared with other industrial systems. The emergy sustainability index indicated that the recycling enterprise was both economically and environmentally sustainable in the long term. However, the emergy technical efficiency indices indicated that the technical level and operational efficiency of the ELV recycling enterprise were relatively low and more investment should be put into the improvement of the recycling technologies. The results of the study can provide useful information for the decision makers to manage ELV recycling enterprises considering not only economic benefits but also the environmental benefits in the long term.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of our {{industrial}} system is determined by decisions taken, and behaviour undertaken, within private households. There have been many detailed studies of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of specific products such as cars or washing machines, and one or two ambitious attempts to compare the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of a wide range of}} product types against a range of environmental criteria (for example the excellent EIPRO project). Such studies tend to consider the impacts of products on a ‘one-at-a-time' basis and do not provide a holistic picture of how the composition, behaviour and evolution of households can affect the specifics of <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> Developing a more holistic understanding of how households consume, and the impacts that consumption has, will help in the development of products and strategies that allow businesses, policy-makers and householders to all play a part, in an integrated way, in the quest to <b>moderate</b> the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of household consumption. This paper reviews existing knowledge on the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of household consumption and explores some approaches to building integrated, systems-based models that could allow a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of these impacts to emerge.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} {{was used to}} evaluate <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of simultaneous fish and plant production through the aquaculture practice of aquaponics. In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a <b>moderate</b> reduction in <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electricity from renewable sources. Of the coproducts considered, avoided water treatment contributed greatest to reductions in <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> due to reductions in energy use, water use, and eutrophication potential. The large reduction in water use suggests that plant production can contribute to increased recirculation rates and further reduce water inputs associated with aquaculture. Aquaponics, similar to other RASs, essentially eliminates local ecological impacts at the cost of high energy use and the addition of industrial fish feeds. Development of sustainable land-based aquaculture will encompass many production systems, including aquaponics; however, all systems will benefit from improved energy efficiency, increased accessibility to renewable energy sources, and development of sustainable fish feeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the sustainability of future organic dairy farming systems in Denmark, by evaluating the economic and environmental consequences of three scenarios at the farm level based on different visions of future sustainability leading to different farm-based goals. The future sustainable organic dairy farming systems were deduced from participative sessions with stakeholders, and used to define specific scenarios and related key parameters. Parameterization of the scenarios was based on model simulations and the invoking of expert knowledge. Each scenario was designed to fulfil different aspects of sustainability. The business as usual scenario (BAU) was driven by economic incentives and implemented new technologies and measures to enhance productivity and efficiency. This scenario was expected to be the mainstream strategy of future organic dairy production in Denmark. In the animal welfare scenario (ANW), economic efficiency was subordinate to animal welfare, and measures to improve animal welfare, such as lower milk yield, extra grazing area and a deep-litter barn, were incorporated. The environmental scenario (ENV) was designed to minimize N losses into the environment, reduce emission of greenhouse gases and the use of fossil energy, and was based on self-sufficiency regarding nutrients and feed. The economic evaluation of the scenarios was based on quantification of farm profitability (i. e. net profit), whereas environmental evaluation was based on the quantification of the N-surplus per ha, emission of greenhouse gases, and use of fossil energy per kg energy-corrected milk (ECM). Compared to prolonging the current main stream strategy (BAU), the evaluation of scenarios revealed that investing in animal welfare comprised trade-offs regarding farm profitability, climate change and the use of fossil energy. In ANW, net profit per farm was almost 39  k[euro] lower than in BAU, whereas emission of greenhouse gases and energy per kg ECM was 8 % and 3 % higher, respectively. Minimizing <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> in ENV reduced local as well as global <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> without an economic trade-off. Greenhouse gas emission per kg ECM was 5 % lower and fossil energy use was 11 % lower than in BAU. The N-surplus of ENV was 80  kg per ha, whereas the N-surplus was approximately 116 in both BAU and ANW. Prolonging the current main stream strategy (BAU) resulted in a high local <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> a <b>moderate</b> global <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> and a high economic risk related to changes in milk price or costs.

40|$|A hybrid {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} of a land based turbot farm was conducted. The aquaculture facility has large heat requirements regarding water. The base case in the study utilise low quality waste heat from the refinery at Mongstad through a heat exchanging process. It has been a comparative study investigating various energy sources heating the water volumes in the system. Comparing with using heat as a by-product at Mongstad, economic costs and <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> increase significantly by using other energy sources, according to the results in this report. Land based aquaculture proves to be an industry with driving incentives for by-product exchange at Mongstad. The refinery benefits from lower waste heat emissions, and the industrial activity in the region expands when initialising such a system at Mongstad. Concerning sustainability of the aquaculture facility this report states that the upstream processes of feed production are important. Conventional fishery to obtain the marine ingredients, {{and the production of}} diesel intended for the vessels, are the most important processes in the system in terms of environmental load. Agricultural products, and oceanic freight connected to them, constitute considerable part of the total <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> In the rest of the system, the construction of fish tank area and installation of technical equipment stand for the largest <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> mainly from purchases in the construction and metals sectors. The use of chemicals for disinfection purposes and {{in the construction of the}} pipe system has noticeable <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> The energy scenarios were based on using electricity, heavy fuel oil and natural gas and they were compared to the base case, using waste heat. Heating the water with electricity purchased from the Norwegian grid lead to <b>moderate</b> increases in <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> and is economically preferable compared to fossil fuels. Using heavy industrial oil to heat the water leads to large increases in impacts from the system.

40|$|The {{primary energy}} use for house heating has {{increased}} {{strongly in the}} second half of the previous century. The <b>environmental</b> and economical <b>impact</b> of this high energy consumption has augmented the use of affordable insulation materials which have <b>moderate</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Sheep wool is one of these natural products which are becoming more popular in the construction industry. Because sheep wool insulation, as a product, is very new on the market and also produced at this moment on relatively small scale, the general properties of sheep wool and especially the properties regarding moisture transfer have not been examined in great detail yet. Therefore, in first instance, a broad research is done about the wool fiber as a material and about the moisture transfer properties of wool (samples) in the hygroscopic range. Traditionally, the vapor transfer inside a material is governed by sorption on one hand, and on the other hand by the resistance to vapor flow. For sheep wool, the (steady-state) sorption behavior of wool has been studied extensively. Also the vapor resistance has been studied in some detail. But, the ?-factor of two wool insulation products with identical mass density can lay far from each other, both being measured according to the German norm (DIN 52615). Because of these differences, it was decided to measure the ?-factor of sheep wool insulation in this study using the well-known cup method. In addition, since wool samples may exhibit varying properties, the sorption isotherm of the wool was measured as well. And finally, besides these two experiments, a third experiment was carried out which focused on the time and space-dependent vapor transfer in a column of wool. The data from this quite unique experiment may indicate whether the vapor transfer inside the wool can be described using a Fickian diffusion model (i. e. one effective differential equation for the vapor transfer) or that non-Fickian effects do occur. The analysis of the cup method indicated that the vapor resistance (?-factor) lies between 1, 2 (at 60 % RH) and 2, 12 (at 95 % RH). As the ?-factor is expected to be constant or decrease with increasing RH, it is speculated that the increase of ?-factor was probably due to dilution of the salt solution. Consequently, the measurement of the permeability at lowest measured RH at the start of the experiment is probably the most reliable one. Therefore, it is concluded from this experiment that the ?-factor is 1, 2 ± 0, 2. In these measurements it was seen that the sorption occurred in two stages after a step in RH. The first stage was fast, and occurred within a couple of hours, while the second step was very slow and took days to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. The second sorption stage was hardly present in the 45 - 60 % RH range, but it was clearly observed in the range of 75 - 90 % RH. This slow second stage of the adsorption is thought to be due to swelling of wool with increasing relative humidity. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

This paper presents a fictional {{case involving a}} multipurpose supply vessel transporting one large object (a 750 -tonne compressor) and 24 containers loaded with chemicals and equipment {{for use by the}} petroleum industry in western Siberia. With technical details representative of vessels navigating the Arctic today, the fictitious ship Oleum has an ice class sufficient for navigating unaccompanied in the Barents and Kara seas, so no assistance is in range when, in late October, clogged fuel filters cause engine failure and the vessel eventually drifts ashore. Heeling over, Oleum loses both cargo and marine diesel oil. The scenario includes a successful helicopter rescue of the 16 crewmembers and a partial recovery of oil and chemicals by booms and skimmers. Recovery of chemicals with physical properties not allowing mechanical collection is not attempted.

40|$|Este artículo contiene 8 páginas, 3 tablas. Marine {{aquaculture}} production {{is becoming increasingly}} important to meet global seafood demands. Conversely, there are concerns about potential <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> especially associated with marine fish farming, and the access to and use of coastal resources. While {{only a small number}} of studies on social acceptability of fish farming exist, understanding the range of perceptions among social groups is a key challenge for successful management of aquaculture, and thus for sustainable development. The case study presented here uses the Qmethodology to explore the perceptions of five aquaculture-related key stakeholder groups (NGOs, local fishermen, fish farming industry, scientists and regional administration) towards marine fish aquaculture in Catalonia (NE Spain). The 30 participants were asked to sort 39 statements about environmental, social and economic aspects of marine fish farming, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The factor analysis identified four distinct factors, each representing a different perception. While Perception 1 regards fish farming as an activity with important socio-economic benefits and low environmental costs, Perception 2 gives highest importance to environmental concerns. Perception 3 represents a more balanced view, valuing the socio-economic benefits and expressing <b>moderate</b> concern about <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> whereas Perception 4 focuses mainly on economic aspects. Interestingly, the four perceptions were represented by various groups of stakeholders and not all respondents from the same sector shared the same perception.

40|$|Densely {{occupied}} drainage basins {{and coastal}} zones {{in developing countries}} that are facing economic growth are {{likely to suffer from}} <b>moderate</b> to severe <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> regarding different issues. The catchment basins draining towards the Atlantic coast from northeastern to southern Brazil include a wide range of climatic zones and diverse ecosystems. Within its borders lies the Atlantic rain forest, significant extensions of semiarid thorn forests (caatinga), vast tree and scrub woodlands (cerrado) and most of the 6670 km of the Brazilian coast and its marine ecosystems. In recent decades, human activities have increasingly advanced over these natural resources. Littoralization has imposed a burden on coastal habitats and communities. Most of the native vegetation of the cerrado and caatinga was removed and only 7 % of the original Atlantic rainforest still exists. Estuaries, bays and coastal lagoons have been irreversibly damaged. Land uses, damming and water diversion have become the major driving forces for habitat loss and aquatic ecosystem modification. Regardless of the contrast between the drought-affected northeastern Brazil and the much more prosperous and industrialized southeastern/southern Brazil, the impacts on habitat and communities were found equally severe in both cases. Attempts to halt environmental degradation have not been effective.
