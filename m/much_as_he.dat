5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded <b>much,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E
5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. He complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E

5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments {{to limit the}} president to a single six-year term and make {{the president and the}} Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him {{of a time when}} he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E
5000|$|After Mason led {{police on}} a {{high-speed}} ATV chase, Mason's mother stated that Mason had the [...] "mindset of a 10-year-old" [...] due to head injuries sustained during his career. She noticed her son’s behavior was different after the 2015 season: “Clearly, {{we could see}} the change. Like, completely... As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he’s</b> accomplished, <b>as</b> hard <b>as</b> <b>he’s</b> worked, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he’s</b> built his character, in record-breaking time it’s going downhill because of what’s going on." [...] In November, Mason pleaded no contest to charges related to the ATV chase. Mason was arrested in January 2017 for the incident and charged with a third degree felony of fleeing and eluding without regard for others' safety or property.|$|R

5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted {{to do the same}} for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E
5|$|Van Dyke {{intended}} {{the picture to}} depict the corrupting influence white culture had on the Eskimos, <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had done in White Shadows in the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Ćorović noted that, in {{comparison}} with Dušan, who had also left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care to appear to Serbians as the legitimate heir {{rather than as a}} foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the preferable ruler. Emphasizing his patience and diplomacy, Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.|$|E

5|$|Apu and his {{new wife}} Manjula invite Homer and Marge to their house for dinner. However, Apu and Manjula get in a fight, after Marge {{mentions}} to Manjula that Apu {{does not need to}} work as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does. The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides to shower Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from all the attention Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders). At Moe's Tavern, Homer encourages several of Springfield's men that they have to prevent Apu and Manjula from reconciling to save their own relationships and marriages.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
5|$|By the war's end in 1945, Bruce {{had become}} {{tired of the}} High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's {{successor}} Ben Chifley {{that he would not}} object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work {{came to the attention of}} Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.|$|E

5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E
