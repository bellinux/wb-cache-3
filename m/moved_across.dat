5|$|On August11, a {{tropical}} cyclone appeared east of Luzon. Over {{the next few}} days, it <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August13. The system <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the South China Sea, intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam. Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August17.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} {{weather in}} the central Atlantic managed to gain enough organization to be designated Tropical Depression Two on July 31. The depression <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the Atlantic without strengthening due to high upper-level wind shear, and dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on August 3.|$|E
2500|$|Sidewinding {{is a type}} of {{locomotion}} {{unique to}} caenophidian snakes, used to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> loose or slippery substrates. [...] It is most often used by the Saharan horned viper, Cerastes cerastes, and the sidewinder rattlesnake, Crotalus cerastes, to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> loose desert sands, but it is also used by Homalopsine snakes in Southeast Asia to <b>move</b> <b>across</b> tidal mud flats. [...] Any number of caenophidian snakes can be induced to sidewind on artificial smooth surfaces, though difficulty in getting them to do so and their proficiency at it vary greatly.|$|R

5|$|Abbott avoided capture until 1995, {{committing}} various robberies as he <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> Australia. He also {{escaped from}} a Queensland prison {{after two years}} and returned to Western Australia, allegedly robbing the Commonwealth Bank's Mirrabooka branch. Abbott was recaptured in Darwin, six months after his escape, and {{was sent to a}} Queensland maximum-security prison with a twenty year sentence to serve.|$|E
5|$|By noon on Sunday, weather {{conditions}} on lower Lake Huron {{were close to}} normal for a November gale. Barometric pressures in some areas began to rise, bringing hope of {{an end to the}} storm. The low pressure area that had <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> Lake Superior was moving northeast, away from the lakes.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{played the}} {{formation}} {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards. With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> to Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was {{left out of the}} side.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October16 and then to hurricane status on October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a monsoon {{depression}} <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> much of India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted {{off the coast}} of Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another {{monsoon depression}} <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the year was a cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81people and causing $28million in damage (2003USD).|$|E

5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E
5|$|Later, the {{remnants}} of Josephine <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> Atlantic Canada, where rainfall peaked at 2.76in (70mm) in northern Newfoundland. The strongest winds in the region were 52mph (83km/h), strong enough to cause ferry service to be canceled or delayed. In Amherst and Fort Lawrence, the storm caused power outages and school closings.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June a {{group of}} rebels reached Thetford, and from there the revolt spread over {{south-western}} Norfolk towards the Fens.

5|$|On June29, a {{tropical}} cyclone developed southeast of Palau. It {{moved to the}} northwest, remaining east of Palau and the Philippines.

The only difference is that the degree of polarization is not quite as strong.|$|R
5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Ernesto <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> southern Ontario, dropping moderate rainfall {{of up to}} 2.1inches (54mm). Wind gusts reached 37mph (60km/h) near Toronto, and the winds {{in combination with the}} rainfall caused power outages when lines snapped. Hundreds were left without power, though the outages were quickly restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the system {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} wave that <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the eastern Caribbean in the last week of May. The wave gradually organized itself as it entered the western Caribbean Sea on June 1. The circulation continued to close up on June 2 and that evening it was declared Tropical Depression One while east of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, a {{tropical}} depression <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> the Philippines through the Visayas, first observed on June26.
