25|$|Bicycle Network {{now also}} offers a number of shorter ride options which may vary {{from year to year}} in order to cater for more riders. For example, single day rides {{referred}} to as the Great Vic Community Ride may be offered, usually either the first or last day of the <b>main</b> <b>ride,</b> or a particularly scenic day. Organisers now also offer a three-day ride option, termed the Great Vic Getaway; this usually covers the last three days of the <b>main</b> <b>ride.</b> Official rider numbers from later years of the rides include these riders who have only taken part in the shorter ride options; this may total from several hundred up to a thousand extra riders.|$|E

500|$|All of the Universal Parks & Resorts {{include a}} Jurassic Park-themed ride. The first was [...] at Universal Studios Hollywood on June 15, 1996, built {{after six years}} of {{development}} at a cost of $110 million. Said attraction was replicated on Universal Studios Japan in 2001. Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, has an entire section of the park dedicated to Jurassic Park that includes the <b>main</b> <b>ride,</b> christened [...] "Jurassic Park River Adventure", and many smaller rides and attractions based on the series. In Universal Studios Singapore, opened in 2010, the Themed Zone named The Lost World consists mostly of Jurassic Park rides, such as the roller coaster Canopy Flyer and the river rapids Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure.|$|E

500|$|Riders {{are then}} ushered into the {{pre-flight}} [...] "Funhouse" [...] room {{by a team}} member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions (Maggie doesn't meet the 40 inch height requirement, and Grampa has certain heart conditions that could be aggravated, which proves to be true as he suffers a heart attack, a stroke and a massive aneurysm while trying to deny that he has any heart conditions). Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out, and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle. Homer enters, followed {{by the rest of}} the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders (but showing Scratchy's attempts to follow the safety rules getting sabotaged by Itchy constantly), while riders are ushered into the <b>main</b> <b>ride</b> room.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple ride cymbals. A sizzle cymbal, {{thinner and}} {{larger than the}} <b>main</b> <b>ride,</b> was once common as a second ride or crash/ride, even in a four-piece kit, but is now less so (jazz drummers, however, may still have two or more ride cymbals, even in a small kit) ...|$|E

A recreation of Hogsmeade is housed at Islands of Adventure while a recreation of Diagon Alley is housed at Universal Studios Florida.|$|R
2500|$|Some cymbals may be {{considered}} effects in some kits but [...] "basic" [...] in another set of components. A swish cymbal may, for example serve, as the <b>main</b> <b>ride</b> in some styles of music, but in a larger kit, which includes a conventional ride cymbal as well, it may well {{be considered}} an effects cymbal per se. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.|$|E
2500|$|Most drummers have {{a single}} <b>main</b> <b>ride,</b> located near their right hand—within easy playing reach, as it is used very regularly—most often a 20" [...] sizing but, 16"-24" [...] diameters are not uncommon. It is most often a heavy, or medium-weighted cymbal that cuts through other {{instrumental}} sounds, but some drummers use a swish cymbal, sizzle cymbal or other exotic or lighter metal ride, as the main or only ride in their kit, particularly for jazz, gospel or ballad/folk sounds. In the 1960s Ringo Starr used a sizzle cymbal as a second ride, particularly during guitar solos.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} anecdotal evidence that suggests riders relate the pecieved &# 039;feel&# 039; of a snowboard to its on-snow performance. Current snowboard design procedures are predominately {{trial and error}} {{due to a lack}} of reliable links between design parameters and resulting snowboard performance. Consequently, manufacturers rely heavily on the feedback of professional riders in order to optimise board designs. The Snowboard Research Group at RMIT University in Melbourne set out to fully characterise the &# 039;feel&# 039; of snowboards for the <b>main</b> <b>riding</b> styles...|$|R

The station artwork and {{exterior}} design follows that of an old Thai palace, with a pagoda style exterior. Peeking Heights opened in 2005, and {{from the top of the}} wheel the entire park is visible. Mystic East also has the Extreme Games Zone.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} form of sizzle cymbal used in a drum kit is a large ride cymbal with a number of rivets loosely fitted but captive in holes spaced evenly around the cymbal close to the rim. This might be called the {{traditional}} pattern sizzle cymbal. The loose fit allows the rivets to rattle in the holes. Swish {{and to a lesser extent}} pang cymbals with rivets installed in this way were heavily used as <b>main</b> <b>ride</b> cymbals in the swing band era, and the swish is traditionally sold with rivets already fitted. Many early rock music drummers, such as Ringo Starr, used a secondary ride cymbal with rivets, normally a ride cymbal thinner than the <b>main</b> <b>ride</b> and ideally one size larger. This was used for variety, to back a lead break or to give extra tone colour to the whole of faster songs such as Roll Over Beethoven.|$|E
