40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 113 - 127) This {{study was}} mainly {{concerned with the}} ability of high school United States history textbooks to provide balance between liberal and conservative viewpoints. Discussion of ideological bias in textbooks {{has been going on}} at least since the 1889 International Peace Conference urged removal of prejudicial statements. Any suggestion of one-sidedness is particularly exigent in the case of U. S. history books because of implications for the history-social studies profession's objective of preparing students to deal effectively with the problems of their increasingly pluralistic nation and interdependent world. Preliminary data about domestic political, economic, and social issues from 1960 to 1984 were gathered from a sample of high school U. S. history books. Each <b>message</b> <b>unit</b> underwent display analysis, which assigned it a weighted value based on its type (paragraph, heading, or graphic) and prominence in the text. Then each unit was analyzed for direction of bias (favorable, unfavorable, balanced/neutral) in order to calculate the Janis-Fadner Coefficent of Imbalance. Bias consisted of two forms: (1) Overt, which applied to material that was unbalanced with respect to detailed definitions of liberalism and conservatism 7 (2) associative, which was developed to account for bias by agenda and for cases where opinions about an ideology are suggested by a topic that happens to be associated with that ideology. It is reassuring, but not surprising, that overt bias was almost non-existent in the representative textbooks examined. Associative bias, in a liberal direction was considerably more pronounced. The study suggested some interesting explanations for these results. It concluded that many texts could do more to support history-social studies goals of teaching students to make informed decisions based on objective analysis...|$|E

40|$|Language {{learning}} strategy (LLS) research {{has provided a}} large body of evidence for the effectiveness of strategy-based instruction (SBI), though the evidence is very limited for pronunciation strategy instruction. For both general and pronunciation LLSs, most research has focused on identifying the strategies used by successful learners. When strategy instruction has been investigated, in most cases the strategies that were taught were not directly linked to specific tasks, learners were not observed using the strategies, and measures of strategy effectiveness often were holistic and did not reveal improvements in specific pronunciation features. The goal {{of this study was to}} extend our understanding of the role of strategy use in L 2 (second language) pronunciation learning by investigating the effectiveness of training future international teaching assistants (ITAs) to critically listen to, transcribe, mark corrections (annotate), and orally rehearse English suprasegmental features in their own speech. The suprasegmental features investigated were <b>message</b> <b>unit</b> boundaries, primary phrase stress, intonation, vowel reduction in content and function words, linking, word stress, and multiword construction stress. Fifteen graduate-level learners of English (14 Mandarin speakers, 1 Korean speaker) from an intact English as a Second Language (ESL) pronunciation class at a Midwestern university were solicited to participate in a repeated-measures design, in which the independent variables were 3 levels of self-monitoring (listening only [L], listening + transcription [LT], and listening + transcription + annotation [LTA]) and rehearsal (R). The strategies were examined in the following combinations: LR-LR-LR, LT-RRR, and LTA-RRR. The dependent variable was the change in suprasegmental accuracy following self-monitoring and rehearsal. Speech data resulting from strategy use were gathered at the beginning and end of a 16 -week semester in order to determine the extent to which strategy use corresponded to improved suprasegmental accuracy. Key findings include the following: (a) All participants made meaningful improvements in suprasegmental accuracy for at least some of the targets following self-monitoring; (b) the LT-RRR combination was most effective for lower proficiency learners and LTA-RRR was most effective for higher proficiency learners; (c) starting proficiency and size of accuracy gains following self-monitoring were negatively correlated; (d) self-monitoring had differential effects on accuracy for the suprasegmental features, with message units, linking, and function words showing the greatest improvement;(e) and observation of individual task performance provided useful insights into how effectively adult L 2 learners utilize self-monitoring strategies.
