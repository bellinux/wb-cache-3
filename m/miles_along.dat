5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the coast to the village of Much Hoole, where it is thought he took up a post as a tutor for the children of the Stones family, who were prosperous haberdashers living at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge {{by driving}} {{autonomously}} for 131 <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, {{a team from}} CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an Urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws. In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} {{in two of the}} boats to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, three miles away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the shore before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because of the lack of provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> {{the river to}} Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered by the state and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E

25|$|For {{some three}} <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the lakeside many Burgundians died {{that day in}} the rout.

As promised, no quarter was granted.|$|E
25|$|The Eurasian landmass extends many {{thousands}} of <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> an east–west axis. Climate zones also extend for thousands of miles, which facilitated the spread of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the diseases associated with domestication. The Americas extend mainly north and south, which, according to the environmental determinist theory popularized by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, meant that it was much harder for cultivated plant species, domesticated animals, and diseases to migrate.|$|E
25|$|These nomad Chaldeans {{settled in}} the far southeastern portion of Babylonia, chiefly on the left bank of the Euphrates. Though {{for a short time}} the name later {{commonly}} referred to the whole of southern Mesopotamia in Hebraic literature, this was a geographical and historical misnomer, as Chaldea proper was in fact only the plain in the far southeast formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending about four hundred <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the course of these rivers, and averaging about a hundred miles in width.|$|E

There is much evidence of prolonged and extensive settlement of the site including for the evidence of around 130 separate structures of various sizes, most probably representing a mix of round houses, pits, and other features.|$|E
25|$|Germantown {{stretches}} {{for about}} two <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> Germantown Avenue northwest from Windrim and Roberts Avenues. Germantown has been consistently bounded on the southwest by Wissahickon Avenue, on the southeast by Roberts Avenue, and on the east by Wister Street and Stenton Avenue, but its northwest border has expanded and contracted over the years. When first incorporated as a borough in 1689, Germantown was separated from the rural Germantown Township by Washington Lane; later, the border was expanded to Carpenter and East Gorgas Lanes; it was then rolled back to Washington Lane in 1846, and remained there until the borough was absorbed into the city of Philadelphia in 1854.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 1 January 1586 Drake arrived off the Bajos de Haina, and Carleill and his {{soldiers}} {{landed on the}} beach which wasn't guarded. The path through the jungle that led towards the city was also defenseless and the English advanced forward. The main fleet under Drake meanwhile sailed ten <b>miles</b> <b>along</b> the coast to Santo Domingo. The Spanish soon saw the threat; troops were mustered, work began on building earthworks to defend the shore, whilst many of the townspeople began slipping out of the city. At {{the mouth of the}} harbor, three ships were sunk to prevent any attempt to force the entrance but it was too late.|$|E
