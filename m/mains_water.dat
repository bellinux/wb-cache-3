Up to 300,000 tons of <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E

5|$|Water {{efficiency}} is being improved {{on a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of <b>mains</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

Philadelphia Water currently maintains 3,200 miles of <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> that can be classified into three distinct sections of mains: transmission mains, distribution mains, and service mains.Transmission <b>mains</b> are larger <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> that move vast amounts of water across Philadelphia between pump stations and reservoirs.

5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield â€” possibly delineating a former right of way.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCast iron <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> {{comprise}} approximately 28 %, by length, of all <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> in Canada and the United States. Many {{of these}} cast-iron <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> are reaching {{the end of}} their expected service lives and their rate of failure is increasing. Of particular concern are large-diameter <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> for which the consequences of failure can be severe. The aim {{of this paper is to}} use a physical, stochastic model previously developed by the authors to identify the most important factors that influence the probability of failure of large-diameter <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> in the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada distribution system. Failure is assumed to occur due to tensile hoop stress and a reduction in strength due to pitting corrosion. The stochastic analysis is implemented using Monte Carlo simulations. A case study of the City of Hamilton water distribution system is presented, in which the model is applied to 20 large-diameter, cast iron <b>water</b> <b>mains.</b> The results suggest that the diameter and burial depth have a moderate to strong influence on the probability of failure. With some exceptions, small-diameter pipes with shallow burial depths were associated with high probabilities of failure and large-diameter pipes deep burial depths were associated with low probabilities of failure. Soil corrosivity and pipe age were found to have a weak effect on probability of failure. There were insufficient samples of pit-cast pipes in the study to draw conclusions on the effect of the casting technique...|$|R
