On {{the one hand}} the contact area was varied from 64 to 1452 µm². Therefore circular pins with different diameters from 9 to 43 µm were investigated.

Keeping the normal force constant for all structures the friction force exhibited only a negligible dependency on the nominal contact area. Scans of the surface topography with an atomic force microscope and calculations of the contact mechanics revealed that the real contact area was very small compared to the nominal one although the coating surface is very smooth (RRMS< 2 nm).

Roll to roll <b>micro</b> <b>contact</b> printers have been built at the lab scale. The process has been demonstrate to have the potential for rapid high volume production. The current limitation is in the quality of the print. Features on the stamp are printed with defects such as breaks or undesired patterning. The source of failure lies with the contact of the stamp; the stamp either breaking contact or collapsing to allow areas outside of the features to make contact. A barrier to better understanding and controlling contact during the printing process has been a lack of in-process measurement.

Especially for micro mechanical and micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) dry lubricants are very essential for applications due to the absence of additional sticking and adhesion phenomena usually induced by liquid lubricants. However, besides the development of thin tribological coatings further improvement of the frictional behaviour can be realized by optimizing the contact situation.

40|$|In {{the sliding}} contact of {{elastomer}} on a rigid substrate, {{the coefficient of}} friction may depend on {{a large number of}} system and loading parameters, including normal force, sliding velocity, shape of contacting bodies, surface roughness and so on. It was argued earlier that the contact configuration is determined more immediately through the indentation depth than the normal force, and thus the indentation depth can be considered as one of "robust governing parameters" of friction. Both models of friction of simple shapes and fractal surfaces demonstrate that the coefficient of friction of elastomers should be generally a function of dimensionless combinations of sliding velocity, surface gradient, relaxation time and size of micro-contacts. The relaxation time does depend only on temperature and the surface slope and the size of <b>micro</b> <b>contacts</b> mostly on the indentation depth. Based on this general structure of the law of friction, we propose a generalized master curve procedure for elastomer friction where the significant governing parameter - indentation depth (or normal force) was taken into account. Unlike the generation of the classical master curve by horizontal shifting of dependence "friction - logarithm of velocity" for different temperatures, in the case of various indentation depth the shifting in both horizontal and vertical direction is required. We experimentally investigated coefficient of friction of elastomer on sliding velocity for different indentation depths and temperatures, and generated a master curve according to this hypothesis...|$|R

The success of laser processing applications in this industry indicates that such techniques should be considered to reduce manufacturing costs and to improve electrical efficiency of solar cells. This thesis examines the application of advanced laser processing to improve the electrical performance and reduce manufacturing costs of solar cells. It focuses on several different aspects of laser processing; (1) understanding and characterising the effect of laser pulses on silicon, (2) developing new fabrication technologies and (3) integrating laser processes with working solar cell devices. The thesis begins with an overview of existing solar cell structures that incorporate laser processing. A study is then presented that explores the detrimental effects of laser processing, {{how it can be}} avoided and how to characterise its influence on solar cell electrical properties. Experimental results combine Yang defect etching, photoconductance decay measurements and a new technique of photoluminescence imaging to isolate the influence of laser ablation and laser melting on silicon wafers. This understanding is used in the development of several laser processes. A laser texturing technique is developed to texture the surface of multicrystalline wafers that cannot be effectively textured with the alkaline etches used on single crystal material. Three advanced laser <b>contacting</b> schemes; laser <b>micro</b> <b>contacts,</b> laser defined aluminium electrodes and laser doping, are assessed as techniques to improve cell efficiency and to reduce fabrication costs. In the final chapter the integration of laser processing with solar cell devices is demonstrated through the fabrication and characterisation of n-type double-sided solar cells with laser doped contacts. Efficiencies of up to 17. 4 % with an open circuit voltage of 672 mV are reported.

As with previous technology node transitions, the materials and processes available are undergoing changes and improvements as vendors encounter and solve problems.

The {{average grain size}} of the incorporated SiC particles was varied, holding the volume content of them in every case at 16 vol%. Mechanical properties (hardness, compression modulus, yield stress) of the filled and neat VE were determined. The tribological properties were investigated in block (composite) – on – ring (steel) test configuration. The steel counter bodies were covered with abrasive papers of different graining. Coefficient of friction (COF) and specific wear rate of the VE + SiC composites were determined. It was observed that the wear resistance increases with increasing average filler grain size and with decreasing abrasiveness of the counter surface.

The simulation results are compared with the existing main theories that study this contact in order to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} <b>micro</b> scale surface <b>contact</b> mechanics...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the stress}} {{distribution}} amongst the constituent grains {{is fundamental to}} predict the response of soil and advance science-based, rather than purely empirical, constitutive models. Photoelastic experiments and discrete element method simulations have provided evidence that, upon loading, discrete force chains form in granular materials. These force chains {{are made up of}} particles transmitting relatively large stresses and they are aligned {{in the direction of the}} major principal stress. A few qualitative studies have identified the presence of these force chains in sands but direct measurements of force chains have not been previously documented and tracking stress transmission in assemblies of real soil grains remains a challenging task. The present study makes use of three dimensional micro CT images to investigate the evolution of the internal topology of a sand subjected to triaxial compression loading. The analysis of the contact normal and branch vector orientations has shown the realignment of the contact normals in the direction of the major principal stress as a clear indication of the formation of force chains in the post-peak regime. Here the extent of the non-colinearity of the branch and contact normal vectors is explored. Using the <b>micro</b> CT data <b>contact</b> force networks within and outside of shear bands are compared...|$|R
5000|$|After Gates {{read the}} January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that {{demonstrated}} the Altair 8800, he <b>contacted</b> <b>Micro</b> Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), {{the creators of}} the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen {{did not have an}} Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and {{over the course of a}} few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership [...] "Micro-Soft" [...] and had their first office located in Albuquerque. Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name [...] "Microsoft" [...] was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.|$|R
