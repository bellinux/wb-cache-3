40|$|ABSTRACT Sex {{determination}} {{in infants}} and children with ambiguous genitalia usually necessitates time-consuming and costly karyotyping. We have evaluated a simple,rapid and reliable method of postnatal sex determination by amplification of X and Y specific microsatellite markers DXS 6797 and SRY respectively by polymerase chain reaction(PCR). Three probands M 78, M 59 and <b>M</b> <b>61</b> with ambiguous genitalia were investigated. M 78 showed a female complement of 46,XX while M 59 and <b>M</b> <b>61</b> have male complement of 46,XY. M 78 was diagnosed as female pseudohermaphrodite while M 59 and <b>M</b> <b>61</b> were identified as male pseudohermaphrodite. Except M 78, where a SRY sequence was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the results of PCR were in agreement with those of cytogenetic analysis. The present study reaffirm {{the fact that the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based sex determination is more sensitive, rapid and reliable than classical cytogenetic method for the detection of cryptic Y-specific SRY sequence in patients with ambiguous genitalia...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} discern trends {{emerging}} in several key decisions (Plaintiff M 70 / 2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission (NSW), Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS, and Plaintiff <b>M</b> <b>61</b> / 2010 E v Commonwealth (<b>M</b> <b>61))</b> {{in which the}} Court is arguably developing and clarifying its approach to judicial review in Australia.

In the cases discussed, the Court may be seen as working towards a rationale that justifies its development of a distinctively Australian jurisprudence. We seek to identify these emerging themes with a view to establishing whether they may be of some predictive value for future public law litigation. We first consider the themes becoming evident in Saeed, Kirk, SZMDS and <b>M</b> <b>61</b> and then assess how Plaintiff M 70 fits into the frame. ...|$|R

30|$|We have {{examined}} temporal changes in seismic {{velocity of the}} crust through repeated active seismic experiments at Iwate volcano, Japan, where a significant volcanic activity and an <b>M</b> <b>6.1</b> earthquake were observed in 1998. We apply a cross spectrum moving window technique to seismic data recorded at eight stations for the six explosions detonated from 1998 to 2003. The seismic velocity at the frequency range of 3 - 9 Hz decreased by about 1 % during the three months including the occurrence of <b>M</b> <b>6.1</b> earthquake. The seismic velocity gradually increased, and about {{one third of the}} decrease was recovered by 2002. Then, the seismic velocity decreased again in 2003. Spatio-temporal changes in the volumetric strains predicted from the <b>M</b> <b>6.1</b> fault mechanism and the volcanic pressure sources are well correlated with the seismic velocity changes observed in 1998. However, the predicted stress fields are not completely matched with the observed velocity changes from 1998 to 2003. This inconsistency may be due to unknown regional tectonic stress field and/or localized stress fields induced by volcanic pressure sources. It {{should be noted that the}} observed velocity changes indicate frequency dependent characteristics although the mechanism is not yet understood.|$|R

40|$|Nutritional {{status in}} people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has {{previously}} been assessed {{in a number of}} ways including BMI, % weight loss and the Mini-Nutritional Assessment(MNA). The symptoms of the disease and the side effects of medication used to manage them result in a number of nutrition impact symptoms that can negatively influence intake. These include chewing and swallowing difficulties, lack of appetite, nausea, and taste and smell changes, among others. Community-dwelling people with PD, aged > 18 years, were recruited (n= 97, <b>61</b> <b>M,</b> <b>36</b> F). The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment(PG-SGA) and (MNA) were used to assess nutritional status. Weight, height, mid-arm circumference(MAC) and calf circumference were measured. Based on SGA, 16 (16. 5 %) were moderately malnourished (SGA B) while none were severely malnourished (SGA C). The MNA identified 2 (2. 0 %) as malnourished and 22 (22. 7 %) as at risk of malnutrition. Mean MNA scores were different between the three groups,F(2, 37) = 7. 30,p<. 05 but not different between SGA B (21. 0 (2. 9)) and MNA at risk (21. 8 (1. 4)) participants. MAC and calf circumference were also different between the three groups,F(2, 37) = 5. 51,p<. 05 and F(2, 37) = 15. 33,p<. 05 but not between the SGA B (26. 2 (4. 2), 33. 3 (2. 8)) and MNA at risk (28. 4 (5. 6), 36. 4 (4. 7)) participants. The MNA results are similar to other PD studies using MNA where prevalence of malnutrition was between 0 - 2 % with 20 - 33 % at risk of malnutrition. In this population, the PG-SGA may be more sensitive to assessing malnutrition where nutrition impact symptoms influence intake. With society’s increasing body size, it might also be more appropriate as it does not rely on MAC and calf circumference measures...|$|R

40|$|People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{have been}} {{reported}} to be at higher risk of malnutrition than an age-matched population due to PD motor and non-motor symptoms and pharmacotherapy side effects. The prevalence of malnutrition in PD has yet to be well-defined. Community-dwelling people with PD, aged > 18 years, were recruited (n = 97, <b>61</b> <b>M,</b> <b>36</b> F). The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PGSGA) was used to assess nutritional status, the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ- 39) was used to assess quality of life, and the Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to measure depression. Levodopa equivalent doses (LEDs) were calculated based on reported Parkinson’s disease medication. Weight, height, mid-arm circumference (MAC) and calf circumference were measured. Cognitive function was measured using the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination. Average age was 70. 0 (9. 1, 35 – 92) years. Based on SGA, 16 (16. 5 %) were moderately malnourished (SGA B) while none were severely malnourished (SGA C). The well-nourished participants (SGA A) had a better quality of life, t(90) = − 2. 28, p < 0. 05, and reported less depressive symptoms, t(94) = − 2. 68, p < 0. 05 than malnourished participants. Age, years since diagnosis, cognitive function and LEDs did not signifi cantly differ between the groups. The well-nourished participants had lower PG-SGA scores, t(95) = − 5. 66, p = 0. 00, higher BMIs, t(95) = 3. 44, p < 0. 05, larger MACs, t(95) = 3. 54, p < 0. 05 and larger calf circumferences, t(95) = 2. 29, p < 0. 05 than malnourished participants.
