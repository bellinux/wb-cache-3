To succeed in such a mission was almost impossible, but he made every effort, and showed rare judgement and coolness in travelling through a disturbed country. He returned on 31 December, without effecting his purpose, but with a considerably enhanced reputation. He was made CB, and in <b>My</b> <b>Mission</b> to Abyssinia (1888) he gave {{an account of the}} expedition.|$|E
25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of <b>my</b> <b>mission</b> is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E

He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation {{to be the most}} important part of his work: [...] "I consider myself a wildlife warrior. <b>My</b> <b>mission</b> is to save the world's endangered species." [...] Irwin bought [...] "large tracts of land" [...] in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as [...] "like national parks" [...] and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.|$|E

First came 6- and [...] shells from a line of eight cruisers, then [...] and [...] shells from a line of six battleships.

The first rounds hit the forecastle and pagoda mast, and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze. Yamashiro two forward turrets targeted her assailants, and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing Mogami and the destroyer Asagumo. The ship continued firing in all directions, but {{was not able to}} target the battleships with the other four operable 14-inch guns of her amidships turrets until almost 04:00, after turning west. There was a big explosion at 04:04, possibly from one of the middle turrets. Yamashiro increased her firing rate between 04:03 and 04:09, despite the widespread fires and damage, and was hit during this time near the starboard engine room by a torpedo. By 04:09, her speed was back up to 12 knots, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: [...] "We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished <b>my</b> <b>mission</b> as pre-arranged.

500|$|Barker {{failed to}} get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was {{employed}} as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning £2.10s.0d (£2.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barrie's Quality Street. He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised {{he wanted to be a}} comic actor. He was described as [...] "ha the talent to be a great straight actor", but noted: [...] "I want to make people laugh. Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt. <b>My</b> <b>mission</b> in life was now crystal clear." [...] He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school. When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after. Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of [...] "Charlie" [...] so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he [...] "ever learned about comedy." ...|$|E

The right was also divided into factions, some wishing a constitutional monarchy under the Orleanist Count of Paris, others under the Bourbon Count of Chambord. It was a very unstable mixture. Early in his Presidency, Thiers declared, [...] "In general, the country is wise, but the political parties are not. It is these, and only these, that we have to fear. It is only these which we have to guard against." [...] Thiers wrote late in his memoirs that he would have preferred a constitutional monarchy, but he knew it was impossible at that moment, given the strong majority of republicans, and supporting a monarchy would have been [...] "a violation of my duties toward France; [...] I had as <b>my</b> <b>mission</b> to pacify and to prevent the conflicts of parties." ...|$|E
