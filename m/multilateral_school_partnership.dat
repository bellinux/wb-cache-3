40|$|In this {{research}} topics of intercultural development are examined through a phenomenographical case study. The study centres around a Comenius <b>Multilateral</b> <b>School</b> <b>Partnership</b> Project, {{which aims to}} improve cooperation and intercultural learning between European schools. As part of the initiative to promote intercultural learning {{of children in the}} countries of the European Union, the European Commission launched a Comenius Project in 2009 - 2011 linking schools in Austria, England, Finland and Germany. The partnership of these countries actualised on multilateral and bilateral level. This study provides an analysis of the practises and learning outcomes from the Finnish perspective through a school partnership between a fifth grade class in Finland and a seventh grade class in Austria. The main focus of the study is the experiences and learning outcomes of the 22 Finnish pupils, that were participants in the Project. Research data is comprised of interviews of pupils, their parents and class teacher, pupil surveys, written narratives and observation of the researcher. Practical aspects of implementing the multi-faceted intercultural learning situations, which culminated to a 7 -day study visit as the Austrian pupils visited Finland and were hosted in homes, are addressed. Key themes of the study involve various aspects of intercultural learning, such as development of intercultural sensitivity, role of national identity, situated learning, language acquisition and curricular frameworks. These themes are approached from theoretical as well as practical viewpoints and aim to build a holistic understanding of intercultural learning in practice. The theoretical basis to intercultural matters discusses the current need for intercultural competence, a challenge posed by globalisation and its various representations. In short, the demand for international cooperation and intercultual skills has increased while the notion of global citizenship has gained ground. The postmodern concept of globalisation is covered in this study through argumentation by scholars such as Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman. An inseparable element of intercultural development, national identity is discussed based on theories of Stuart Hall. At the core of the theoretical framework, Milton Bennett’s Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity outlines the fundamental components of intercultural development setting the standard for analysis of research findings.             The most significant learning outcomes from pupils’ viewpoint are increased competence and courage to speak a foreign language as part of developed intercultural skills, and motivation to become acquainted with foreign cultures and people. Pupils also shifted in their thinking to a more accepting attitude towards cultural difference while learning to appreciate and embrace the uniqueness of their own culture. Eagerness to claim every culture as equal increased as well as understanding of global issues. Other findings suggest that teaching intercultural topics may be integrated into the objectives of the National Curriculum, although readiness to integrate and implement these topics require intercultural awareness and competence from teachers. Overall, participation in the Comenius Project was regarded a positive experience and a privilege by nearly all participants, which indicates a progressive development to the direction where the countries of European Union are encouraged.

40|$|Although a rich {{tradition}} of mainly U. S. and UK {{research focuses on}} the nature and effects of tracking students with in schools, little research has investigated the importance of tracking students in the same or in separate schools. The authors used data from a unique, representative survey in Flanders (Belgium) to examine bow students' study involvement varied between <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools</b> (in which all different tracks are offered) and categorial schools (in which only particular tracks are offered) and whether the relation between track and study involvement varied between these school types. Multilevel analyses of data gathered in 2004 and 2005 from academic and vocational third and fifth grade students {{in a sample of}} Flemish secondary schools showed that vocational students had slightly lower study involvement in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools.</b> Although academic students were more study involved than vocational students, this difference was larger in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools</b> than in categorial schools. The data suggest that in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools,</b> vocational students compared themselves with academic track students, consistent with, the hypothesis of increased status deprivation, resulting in even stronger antischool attitudes.

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} standard against which international <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> can be evaluated and assesses its applicability using the outcomes from a <b>school</b> <b>partnership</b> programme. The {{development of the}} 'successful <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> standard' for international links utilises a large literature review that incorporates good practice guidance and research into international partnerships. The study provides the UK educational context for international <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> and identifies areas where such <b>partnerships</b> can deliver <b>school</b> improvement. These educational drivers for <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> are mapped onto the 'successful <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> standard' {{to determine whether it}} provides a valid framework for comparing policy and practice. The 'standard' is assessed through its application as a means of evaluating to what extent the European-funded Comenius <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> programme can be deemed successful. The study builds an evaluation framework based on the 'standard' to assess the quality of the outcomes and impact of Comenius <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> and to consider whether the European-focused <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> differ in any important aspect from other global partnership programmes. Mixed methods are used to assess the secondary data from the Comenius <b>school</b> <b>partnership</b> programme. Key findings from the study include: 1. The 'successful <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> standard' provides a useful framework for comparing <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> against the educational landscape 2. Comenius partnerships demonstrate a close alignment with the 'successful <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> standard' 3. Analysis of the Comenius data identifies the programme as an effective vehicle to support the delivery of two major education initiatives: 3. 1 Developing a workforce with the necessary skills to live and work in a global economy: using the evaluation schedule the impact of Comenius <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> on learners is excellent 3. 2 Providing professional development for teachers: 75...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} effects of ability {{grouping}} has usually been conducted within schools. In the British and North American context, where the bulk {{of this kind of}} research has been carried out, ability grouping commonly occurs within schools. In Flanders – the Dutch-speaking, northern part of Belgium – as in other European countries, there are not only tracks within schools, but schools themselves can be distinguished by the curriculum they offer. This study questions whether students’ global self-esteem is affected differently by processes of within-school tracking (<b>multilateral</b> <b>schools)</b> compared to processes of between-school tracking (categorial schools). Analyses are based on a subsample of the Flemish Educational Assessment, gathered in 2004 – 2005, encompassing 10 multilateral and 56 categorial schools with 3, 758 academic and 2, 152 vocational students. Multi-level analyses (HLM 6) show that academic students have a significant higher self-esteem than vocational students and this difference is larger in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools.</b> Academic students in <b>multilateral</b> <b>schools</b> have a slightly higher self-esteem than those in categorial schools. Conceivably, academic students compare themselves with the vocational track students, leading to a higher awareness of status gratification, resulting in a higher self-esteem...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the {{creation}} of a charter school and public <b>school</b> <b>partnership</b> in Pennsylvania. Developing a partnership between a charter school and public district requires careful planning and specialized legal assistance. Successful partnerships can result in significant benefits to the charter school and public school district in the partnership. This study documents in detail the creation and operation of the Beaver Area Academic Charter School, the development of the partnership with Beaver Area School District and the innovative instructional programs that have been created {{as a result of this}} partnership. Additionally the study documents the financial benefits and the opportunities to share and consolidate services. The implications of this study for other educators in Pennsylvania can be divided into two themes: (1) Guidelines for those planning to create a charter <b>school</b> <b>partnership</b> with a public school district; and (2) benefits, possibilities and consequences of charter school and public <b>school</b> <b>partnerships</b> operating in Pennsylvania. As the primary founder of the Beaver Area Academic Charter School and as the principal researcher in this study, this dissertation is a documentation of my own learning in this about charter school and <b>school</b> district <b>partnerships.</b> It is my hope that other educators in Pennsylvania can create such partnerships to enhance the academic achievement of students. this study provide guidelines to creating successful public <b>school</b> <b>partnerships...</b>|$|R
