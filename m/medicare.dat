5|$|Spending {{reductions}} {{included a}} reduction in <b>Medicare</b> reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private <b>Medicare</b> Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and <b>Medicare</b> Payment Advisory Commission found to be excessively costly relative to government Medicare; and reductions in <b>Medicare</b> reimbursements to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.|$|E
5|$|The act {{includes}} {{a host of}} delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality.

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including <b>Medicare</b> or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by <b>Medicare</b> Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, <b>Medicare</b> was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
25|$|As part of <b>Medicare's</b> pricing system, {{relative}} value units (RVUs) {{are assigned to}} every medical procedure. One RVU translates into a dollar value that varies by region and by year; in 2005 the base (not location adjusted) RVU equaled roughly $37.90. Major insurers use <b>Medicare's</b> RVU calculations when negotiating payment schedules with providers, and many insurers simply adopt <b>Medicare's</b> payment schedule. The AMA-sponsored committee in charge of determining RVUs of medical procedures that inform <b>Medicare's</b> payment to physicians {{has been shown to}} grossly inflate their figures.|$|R
40|$|MBA Professional ReportThis {{project will}} examine the {{feasibility}} of implementing <b>Medicare's</b> mental health prospective payment system (PPS) for Tricare beneficiaries treated in inpatient psychiatric facilities. Background information will be presented on both Tricare's current per diem system and <b>Medicare's</b> mental health PPS to facilitate {{a comparison of the}} systems. Specifically, a financial analysis will be performed to determine if the adoption of <b>Medicare's</b> mental health PPS can be a cost savings measure for the Department of Defense. This project will compare payments for mental diagnoses under the per diem system and PPS. The anticipated product of this project is a proposal to Tricare Management Activity, Aurora, CO to either implement <b>Medicare's</b> mental health PPS or to stay with the current system. The premise for adopting <b>Medicare's</b> mental health PPS would be to demonstrate potential for tangible cost savings over the current system. Should this project demonstrate the potential for little or no cost savings then the recommendation would be to reject <b>Medicare's</b> mental health PPS. US Navy (USN) authors...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending <b>Medicare</b> to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the <b>Medicare</b> Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from <b>Medicare</b> for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, <b>Medicare</b> is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. <b>Medicare</b> patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other <b>Medicare</b> benefits that could prolong life. Under the <b>Medicare</b> provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
25|$|Popular opinion {{surveys show}} that the public views <b>Medicare’s</b> {{problems}} as serious, but not as urgent as other concerns. In January 2006, the Pew Research Center found 62 {{percent of the public}} said addressing <b>Medicare’s</b> financial problems should be a high priority for the government, but that still put it behind other priorities. Surveys suggest that there’s no public consensus behind any specific strategy to keep the program solvent.|$|R

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to <b>Medicare</b> by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for <b>Medicare</b> were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from <b>Medicare</b> alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with <b>Medicare</b> certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, <b>Medicare</b> alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of <b>Medicare</b> and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of <b>Medicare,</b> Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in <b>Medicare.</b> Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} is that the care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided.
