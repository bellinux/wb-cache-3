Gibson then remarked, [...] "Oh, I had a brother who died with Franklin at the North Pole and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great deal of trouble getting his pay from Government".|$|E

He flatly refused to talk about Whitehead, and when I asked him why, he said: 'That SOB never paid me what he owed me. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hauling {{business}} and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to {{where he wanted to}} go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire in January 2010, Blagojevich said about President Obama, [...] "Everything he's saying's on the teleprompter. I'm blacker than Barack Obama. I shined shoes. I {{grew up in a}} five-room apartment. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> little laundromat in a black community not far from where he lived. I saw it all growing up." [...] He soon backpedaled from the term [...] "blacker than", saying that he chose his words poorly, but he stood by his message that [...] "the frustration is real, and the frustration is still, today, average, ordinary people aren't getting a fair shake." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... my father's {{family came}} from Pinsk and I knew {{of a famous}} rabbi related to him.

6000|$|... 'A Scotch fashion,' Harold answered. 'The heir to a laird {{is called}} Younger of so-and-so. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> small estate {{of that name}} in Dumfriesshire; a very small estate: I was born and brought up there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>a</b> grumbling letter. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> vague {{idea that}} in some way or other I ought to pick up my living, though he never offers a {{suggestion}} as to how I should do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I thought myself {{it was a}} silly business, but I {{could not}} forget <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hand in it. [...] "Surely, sir, it had some note of tragedy," [...] said I.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot tell you, {{lest they}} thought silence {{the best way}} to keep off the yankees. You know, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> great dread of a yankee's getting a finger into any of his bargains. He says the yankees are the locusts of the west." ...|$|R

60|$|LORD GORING. The fact is, I am horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I gave orders I {{was not at}} home to any one. Even <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{comparatively}} cold reception. He {{complained of}} a draught the whole time.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was. This {{farm was}} left to my father by Lorimer Spell because my father saved Spell's life on a {{battlefield}} in France. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of papers to prove his claim, but the papers were stolen from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And lost {{half of his}} estate,' {{answered}} Foxley, {{with more}} rapidity than usual; 'and was very near--hem--being hanged into the boot.

6000|$|... "And Mrs. Hawker {{will come}} on Tuesday, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield on Wednesday, and honest, brave straight-forward, literati-hating Captain Truck, on Thursday, at the latest.

60|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been <b>a</b> {{judge and}} I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> brother {{who was a}} barrister; but the madness was upon me and I spoke quickly and convincingly.|$|R
5000|$|William {{disliked the}} Tarbolton dancing class that Robert {{attended}} {{and the poet}} later wrote that [...] "In my seventeenth year, to give my manners a brush, I went to a country dancing school. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> unaccountable antipathy against these meetings; and my going was, what to this hour I repent, in absolute defiance of his commands. <b>My</b> <b>father,</b> as I said before, was the sport of strong passions; from that instance of rebellion he took a kind of dislike to me..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> brother high {{in favour}} with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada--thither we go, secure {{of peace and}} protection, for the payment of such ransom as the Moslem exact from our people." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear {{mother had}} borne her long {{struggle}} without a sign all these years, {{but now that}} she was so suddenly eased of it she fell sobbing upon his neck. It was a long time before <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> thought to spare upon my examination in arithmetic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he could. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{friend who}} left a little dog in Paris; and the {{creature}} {{found her in}} Milan, and died of fatigue next day.

60|$|I {{should not}} even <b>have</b> known that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>a</b> second wife {{but for some}} friend (or enemy)--I never {{discovered}} the person--who sent me a newspaper containing an announcement of the marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Burns also {{attended}} dancing lessons in here 1779, {{much to his}} father's annoyance as the poet later recorded: [...] "In my seventeenth year, to give my manners a brush, I went to a country dancing school. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> unaccountable antipathy against these meetings; and my going was, what to this hour I repent, in absolute defiance of his commands. <b>My</b> <b>father,</b> as I said before, was the sport of strong passions; from that instance of rebellion he took a kind of dislike to me..."

6000|$|... 'What!' cried Dick, 'go {{in months}} after, and brag that I {{had meant to}} thrash the man, and then didn't. And why? Because <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> made <b>a</b> bigger ass of himself than I supposed. My dear, that's nonsense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God {{sent him}} to my succour, as by a miracle," [...] Claire said simply. [...] "The Chevalier Fletcher is known to my father.

60|$|Dermody, the bailiff, possessed {{relatives}} in London, {{of whom he}} occasionally spoke, and {{relatives in}} Scotland, whom he never mentioned. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong prejudice against the Scotch nation.

6000|$|... "You {{must know}} that my {{grandfather}} had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged {{at the time of}} the invention of bicycling.

60|$|It {{would have}} pleased me well to find <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> talk with him; but I {{did not feel}} {{warranted}} in leaving my comrades at such a time, therefore I acted at once upon Jerry's suggestion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she-â€”in reason; but {{the worst}} of it is, Dolores, that the wretched woman avers that she deceived <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> old rascally tyrant of an Italian husband, who might have been alive when she married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we all do}} that. Well, good-night. I am so {{very pleased}} that you have come to live at Molehill; it will be so nice for <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> companion," [...] she added as an afterthought.|$|R
