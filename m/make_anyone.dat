500|$|Fey {{is known}} for her deadpan humor and delivery; her [...] "sardonic wit" [...] has become a {{trademark}} of hers, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey's work. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey [...] "project both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" [...] in her performances, while The Chronicles Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in [...] "delectable, situational and ironic comedy". On Fey's comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee [...] "has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it." [...] Michaels concluded, [...] "It's not fearful. It's strong and confident and you recognise the voice {{and most of the}} time you agree with it." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey [...] "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that [...] "Glasses <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> look smarter".|$|E
500|$|Spaihts was {{tasked with}} {{exploring}} unresolved mysteries from Alien, {{such as the}} Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E
500|$|... "Straight Outta Cold Beer" [...] was {{positively}} received by music critics, {{with many of}} them describing it as a [...] "party" [...] song. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times singled it out for being a [...] "sly party tune" [...] among the other tracks on If I'm Honest. Similarly, Keith Harris from Rolling Stone called it a [...] "rowdy party-starter" [...] and appreciated its word play reference to the 1988 N.W.A album Straight Outta Compton in the title. Entertainment Tonight's Sophie Schillaci declared it a [...] "fun track" [...] that stayed true to the singer's [...] "classic country roots". A staff member from WUSN enjoyed the recording, and claimed it would <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> more excited for If I'm Honest, which was then unreleased. Regarding {{the subject matter of}} [...] "Straight Outta Cold Beer", Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic found Shelton to be [...] "rais a little hell". Robyn Collins from Radio.com created a list of the [...] "5 Best Songs on Blake Shelton's If I'm Honest" [...] and included [...] "Straight Outta Cold Beer". She wrote, [...] "this party anthem is another perfect country-boy song that says some of the same things in brand new ways with music that’ll make you have to tap a boot." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> the bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E

However, the Peyote ingredient <b>makes</b> <b>anyone</b> who drinks the juice hallucinate. Chief Wiggum catches on and soon the police surround the farm. Homer defends Seth, Munchie and the hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, planting a flower in each of the officer's guns. However, Wiggum discharges his, lodging its flower in Homer's forehead and leaving him hospitalized.|$|R

2500|$|Soon afterward, Franzen's {{invitation}} {{to appear on}} Oprah's show was rescinded.

2500|$|On {{the second}} series of The F Word, Ramsay showed a {{softened}} stance on vegetarianism after learning about intensive pig farming practices including castration and tail docking. On the programme, Ramsay commented, [...] "It's enough to <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> turn fucking vegetarian, for God's sake.

5000|$|The {{transgender}} {{community was}} largely {{disappointed by the}} image of forced gender reassignment surgery and a boycott was created in response.

2500|$|Because Emperor Wu did not <b>make</b> <b>anyone</b> empress after Empress Wei Zifu {{committed}} suicide, {{and he left}} no {{instruction on}} who should be enshrined in his temple with him, Huo chose to enshrine Consort Li with Emperor Wu.

I wouldn't condone that type of behaviour and to spit at anyone is disgraceful behaviour. I really cannot understand the behaviour of anybody who insults or demeans anyone. It has no part in Gaelic games. My message to those people is 'we don't need you'. I don't want them in our organisation and I don't want them going to our games.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't <b>make</b> <b>anyone's</b> top ten list of great Family Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out {{on the wrong foot}} with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline. [...] Most of the Jackass stuff was way too stale–Peter jackknifing Quagmire into the crate of bees notwithstanding–but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline, the introduction of a younger 'New Brian'".|$|R
