5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|High relates {{that the}} great serpent Jörmungandr, also {{described}} as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout {{the air and the}} sea.|$|E

5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E
25|$|Copepods, {{the primary}} zooplankton, {{are a major}} item on the forage fish menu. They are a group of small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04in) to two millimetres (0.08in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open and their opercula fully expanded.|$|E
25|$|The {{megamouth shark}} (Megachasma pelagios) is {{a species of}} {{deepwater}} shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is {{the smallest of the}} three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the whale shark and basking shark. Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with 63 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of May 2017, including four recordings on film. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its enormous <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. It is distinctive for its large head with rubbery lips. It is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the distinct family Megachasmidae, though suggestion has been made that it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae, of which the basking shark is currently the sole extant member. In addition to the living M.pelagios, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian M.alisonae and the Oligocene–Miocene M.applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma, and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology.|$|E

He retained the source's [...] "clumsiness" [...] in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter [...] "cryptic command". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar from his nose to his cheek and he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him with his <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, also opting to leave the eye which was not looking through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story.|$|E
500|$|Cope was {{described}} by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as [...] "a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity". To him, Fowler wrote, [...] " [...] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful." [...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder".|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{began to}} debate the {{function}} of the American paddlefish's rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s. They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid. However, laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered {{with tens of thousands of}} sensory receptors. [...] These receptors are morphologically similar to the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and rays, and are indeed passive ampullary-type electroreceptors used by American paddlefish to detect plankton. [...] Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps. The American paddlefish's diet consists primarily of zooplankton. Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields, which signal not only the presence of zooplankton, but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages. When a swarm of zooplankton is detected, the paddlefish swims forward continuously with their <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey. Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension-feeding. Further research has indicated that their electroreceptors may also serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance.|$|E

[...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime.

[...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be."

2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with {{his head back and}} his <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell was a long way behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw his head back and with <b>mouth</b> <b>wide</b> open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship.
