50|$|The {{antecedents of}} musical theatre in Europe {{can be traced}} back to the theatre of ancient Greece, where music and dance were {{included}} in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE. The dramatists Aeschylus and Sophocles composed their own music to accompany their plays and choreographed the dances of the chorus. The 3rd-century BCE Roman comedies of Plautus included song and dance routines performed with orchestrations. The Romans also introduced technical innovations. For example, to make dance steps more audible in large open-air theatres, Roman actors attached <b>metal</b> <b>chips</b> called sabilla to their stage footwear, creating the first tap shoes. The music from all of these forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre.|$|E

Parts washers may be as simple as the manual [...] "sink-on-a-drum" [...] common to many auto repair shops, or they may be very complex, multi-stage units with pass-through parts handling systems.

50|$|As the MA-5 capsule {{reached the}} Canton Island station, Mercury Control {{realized}} that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> in a fuel supply line had caused one of the clockwise roll thrusters to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 g (0.49 m/s²) light telemetry signal. The remaining thrusters used 9.5 lb of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit.

In case 2, injury was caused by a shard released from an angle grinder disc that struck the orbit and caused severe disruption of the globe, which required enucleation.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns with}} the <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> size monitoring method in deep-hole machining process. Monitoring {{and control of}} the chip size and shape is very important in deep-hole machining because a visual monitoring is obstructed by hidden chip passages. Yet, for the process, any chip size which may result in passages clogging will result in a failure of machining process. In this manufacturing process monitoring system, the three principal components for chip status monitoring have been investigated: the sensing chip concentration, the signal processing, and the classification (decision making). A new sensing system and monitoring method have been investigated and proposed for use. An inductive proximity sensor was selected and used for data acquisition (sensing), and a personal computer utilized for signal processing. As a monitoring method, the expert system of deep-hole machining control has been suggested for decision making based on the sensing system signal. The experimental testing has revealed that the sensing system signal is strong enough to be used for the machine tool control...|$|R

Boxes of various materials, and objects unneeded {{in the rest of}} the house, are also often stored there; in this regard, the unfinished basement takes the place both of the cellar and of the attic. Home workshops are often located in the basement, since sawdust, <b>metal</b> <b>chips,</b> and other mess or noise are less of a nuisance there.

50|$|Processing {{contaminants}} {{are generated}} during {{the processing of}} foods (e.g., heating, fermentation). They are absent in the raw materials, and are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided. Technological processes can be adjusted and/or optimized, however, {{in order to reduce}} the levels of formation of processing contaminants. Examples are: nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heterocyclic amines, histamine, acrylamide, furan, benzene, trans fat, 3-MCPD, semicarbazide, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and ethyl carbamate. There is also the possibility of <b>metal</b> <b>chips</b> from the processing equipment contaminating food. These can be identified using metal detection equipment. In many conveyor lines, the line will be stopped, or when weighing the product with a Check weigher, the item can be rejected for being over- or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{high speed}} {{machining}} {{would not be}} possible without the use of metalworking fluids (MWFs). MWFs perform a number of useful functions like cooling and lubrication. They also assist with <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> evacuation and short-term corrosion protection. It is estimated that 90 million U. S. gallons of water-soluble MWF concentrate are manufactured annually in the U. S. alone to meet the above needs. MWFs become process effluents when the accumulation of contaminants such as extraneous oil, particulate debris from machining operations, and bacteria negatively impact functionality. One to two billion U. S. gallons of oily wastewater result annually from the use of MWFs. Reducing this environmental footprint has become an important objective for both manufacturers and end-users of MWFs. Oil-containing MWFs are conventionally formulated to be highly stable emulsions. These emulsions are difficult to maintain, recycle, and treat (Byers, 1994). Preliminary work indicated that transiently stable emulsions can provide comparable lubrication, while also potentially being easier to maintain and recycle. They also offer fewer problems for waste treatment than their stable counterparts. This report focuses on a rational approach to designing such transiently stable emulsions by elucidating the important factors affecting lubrication, cooling, and phase separation.

40|$|AbstractMachining cost {{is a most}} {{important}} factor for manufacturing a product. The machining cost for each machine tool is often estimated from {{the total cost of}} a factory according to the conventional method used for industrial management. The total income and expenditure of a factory can be obtained, however the operation status of machine tools is different. That is to say that an accurate machining cost for each part can’t be estimated and then cutting conditions realizing minimum machining cost cannot be discussed before a real machining operation. Hence, an estimation method of machining cost is proposed with using ABC (activity-based costing). The activities related to electric consumption of a machine tool, coolant, lubricant oil, cutting tool and <b>metal</b> <b>chip</b> are considered for total machining cost in this research. Based on the estimation method, the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum machining cost is introduced and discussed. An adequate cutting condition can be obtained by calculating an approximate equation with using least-square method and exploring a cutting condition achieving the minimum machining cost with using iterative calculation in this paper. The feasibility of the proposed estimation method of machining cost and the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum machining cost is demonstrated through some case studies...|$|R
