25|$|Strong lensing is the {{observed}} distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes {{through such a}} gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including Abell 1689. By measuring the distortion geometry, {{the mass of the}} intervening cluster can be obtained. In the dozens of cases where this has been done, the mass-to-light ratios obtained correspond to the dynamical dark matter measurements of clusters. Lensing can lead to multiple copies of an image. By analyzing the distribution of <b>multiple</b> <b>image</b> copies, scientists have been able to deduce and map the distribution of dark matter around the MACS J0416.1-2403 galaxy cluster.|$|E
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that {{providing}} face averages to people that are searching for faces in crowds, for example security and police personnel, may result in better search accuracy. However, because face averages require <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> to construct them, {{it may be more}} beneficial to give <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> to officers in the field. Indeed, there may be additional benefits of providing <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> for face search, as recent work has found that exposure to within-face variability presented across <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> benefits face matching accuracy (Bindemann & Sandford, 2011; Etchells et al., 2017; Menon et al., 2015 a, 2015 b; White et al., 2014). In the next experiment, we simulate exposure to variability by providing a search template consisting of <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> of the target to determine whether this also improves search performance.|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} {{irradiance}} scattering and haze {{depends on the}} unknown scene depth, which makes haze removal complicated. Most haze removal methods require <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> or additional prior information. The methods in [1, 2] remove haze using <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> under different degrees of polarization. In [3 – 5], the haze-free image is obtained from <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> with different weather conditions. By inputting depth prior information or 3 D models, the methods in [6, 7] can also restore haze-free images.|$|R
30|$|Visual {{cryptography}} (VC) is an {{encryption technique}} for hiding a secret image in distributed and shared images (referred to as shares). VC schemes are employed to encrypt <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> as meaningless, noisy patterns or meaningful <b>images.</b> However, decrypting <b>multiple</b> secret <b>images</b> using a unique share is difficult with traditional VC. We propose {{an approach to}} hide <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> in meaningful shares. We can decrypt <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> simultaneously using a common share, which we refer to as a magic sheet. The magic sheet decrypts <b>multiple</b> secret <b>images</b> depending on a given share. The shares are printed on transparencies, and decryption is performed by physically superimposing the transparencies. We evaluate the proposed method using binary, grayscale, and color images.|$|R
500|$|Several {{photographs}} were considered as candidates {{for a single}} cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in County Kildare; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a Trabant, an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe. Ultimately, a <b>multiple</b> <b>image</b> scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers thought that [...] "the sense of flux expressed by both {{the music and the}} band's playing with alter egos was best articulated by the lack of a single viewpoint". The resulting front sleeve is a 4×4 squared montage. A mix of Corbijn's original images from Berlin and the later photo shoots was used, as the band wanted to balance the [...] "colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco". Some {{photographs were}} used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity. Images of the band with Trabants, several of which were painted bright colours, appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet. These vehicles were later incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour set design as part of the lighting system. The nude photo of Clayton was placed on the rear cover of the record. On the US compact disc and cassette sleeves, Clayton's genitals are censored with a black [...] "X" [...] or a four-leaf clover, while vinyl editions feature the photo uncensored. The label of the physical CD and vinyl record features an image of a [...] "babyface" [...] graffitied by artist Charlie Whisker onto an external wall of Windmill Lane Studios. The babyface image was later adopted as a logo for Zoo TV Tour memorabilia and was incorporated into the Zooropa album cover. In 2003, music television network VH1 ranked Achtung Babys sleeve at number 39 on its list of the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers". Bono has called the sleeve his favourite U2 cover artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Although GIF {{is almost}} never used for true color images, it is {{possible}} to do so. A GIF image can include <b>multiple</b> <b>image</b> blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a [...] "transparent" [...] color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.|$|E

30|$|In Experiment 3, we {{have found}} that search {{templates}} elicited from <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> lead to faster and more accurate search than those from face averages. These results extend the findings of studies of unfamiliar face matching (White et al., 2014), where <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> have been shown to lead to more accurate matching performance than face averages. Although face averages contain the invariant features of a face, it appears that the variance information contained in <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> produces more robust templates for visual search.|$|R
50|$|Cerebral polyopia is {{most often}} {{associated}} with occipital or temporal lobe lesions, as well as occipital lobe epilepsy. This condition is relatively uncommon, thus further research regarding its causes and mechanism has not been performed. Polyopia can be experienced as partial second or <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> to either side (or in any eccentricity) of an object at fixation. Polyopia occurs when both eyes are open, or when one eye is open, during fixation on a stimulus. Known cases of polyopia provide evidence that, {{in relation to the}} stimulus at fixation, <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> can appear at a constant distance in any direction; gaps in portions of an object at fixation can exist; <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> can be overlayed vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on top of the stimulus; and the <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> can appear different sizes, alignments, and complexities. The complexity of the stimulus does not appear to affect the clarity of the <b>multiple</b> <b>images.</b> The physical distance of the stimulus from the patient (near or far) also does not seem to affect the presence of multiple images.7 However, if the stimulus is swung or moved, <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> of that object can either be extinguished or transformed into different objects, depending on the severity of the condition.|$|R

50|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>images</b> {{are used}} in Zeng's {{approach}} to surface reconstruction from <b>multiple</b> <b>images.</b> A central idea is to explore the integration of both 3D stereo data and 2D calibrated images. This approach is motivated {{by the fact that}} only robust and accurate feature points that survived the geometry scrutiny of <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> are reconstructed in space. The density insufficiency and the inevitable holes in the stereo data should then be filled in by using information from <b>multiple</b> <b>images.</b> The idea is thus to first construct small surface patches from stereo points, then to progressively propagate only reliable patches in their neighborhood from images into the whole surface using a best-first strategy. The problem thus reduces to searching for an optimal local surface patch going through a given set of stereo points from images.|$|R
30|$|This study {{replicated}} {{the large}} differences in search speed and accuracy between unfamiliar and familiar faces found in Experiment 1, with familiar faces found {{more quickly and}} accurately than unfamiliar faces. Furthermore, showing <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> of a target resulted in better search performance, with targets found both more quickly and more accurately with four images compared to one. This suggests that the search templates elicited from <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> are more robust than the template based on a single image. This {{is consistent with the}} benefit of <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> observed in studies of unfamiliar face matching (Bindemann & Sandford, 2011; Menon et al., 2015 a, 2015 b; White et al., 2014). Importantly for face search, <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> showed the largest improvement for unfamiliar faces, suggesting that this may be a practical way to enhance search performance in applied settings.|$|R

40|$|Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are a well studied 2 D {{deformable}} model. One recently proposed {{extension of}} AAMs to <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> is the Coupled-View AAM.

In this paper, we describe how a single AAM can be fit to <b>multiple</b> <b>images,</b> captured simultaneously by cameras with arbitrary geometry and response functions. Our algorithm retains the major benefits of Coupled-View AAMs: the integration of information from <b>multiple</b> <b>images</b> into a single model, and improved fitting robustness. ...|$|R
