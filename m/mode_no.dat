5|$|The International {{version of}} Final Fantasy VII was {{released}} on PlayStation Network (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009. This version was compatible with both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable with support for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV coming later. Final Fantasy VII was later released as a PSOne Classic in North America, Europe and Australia on June 2. The PC version was updated by DotEmu for use on modern operating systems and released via Square Enix's North American and European online stores on Aug. 14, 2012. It included high resolution support, cloud saves, achievements and a character booster. It would later be released via Steam on July 4, 2013, replacing the version available on Square Enix's North American and European online stores. The PC version would be released in Japan {{for the first time}} on May 16, 2013, exclusively via Square Enix's Japanese online store with the International version title. It has features unavailable in the western version including high speed <b>mode,</b> <b>no</b> random encounters mode and a max stats command. A release for iOS, based on the PC version and adjusted for mobile devices by D4 Enterprise, {{was released on}} August 19, 2015, with an auto-save feature. After being announced at PlayStation Experience 2014, the PC version was released for PlayStation 4 on December 5, 2015. DotEmu developed the PS4 version. A version for Android was released on July 7, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Yielded {{structures}} {{have a lower}} stiffness, {{leading to}} increased deflections and decreased buckling strength. The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have residual stresses. Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a fail-safe failure <b>mode.</b> <b>No</b> safety factor is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of 2 A 3 MP three modes are {{associated}} mainly with the C–H in-plane-bending vibrations: <b>mode</b> <b>nos.</b> 19, 21 and 22. These modes are at the following wavenumbers 1257, 1137 and 1079  cm− 1 and at 1250, 1125 and 1037  cm− 1 in {{the case of}} 2 A 4 MP. The C–H out-of-plane bending vibrations correspond mainly to the <b>mode</b> <b>nos.</b> 28, 29 and 30. The calculated frequencies of the C–H out-of-plane bending vibrations in 2 A 3 MP at 852, 755 and 748  cm− 1 and in 2 A 4 MP at 828, 780 and 746  cm− 1 show very good agreement with experimental data.|$|R
