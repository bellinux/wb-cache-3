Honey were harvested in year 2006 and 2007 and bought in retail chain, special shops and directly from bee-keeper. Samples were analyzed by titration, spectrofotometry, LC/MS and RP-HPLC methods. The study {{was focused on}} analysis of antioxidants. Followed groups of antioxidants were determined: flavonoids, catechins, carotenoids, vitamins E, C, A. Authenticity of quality was determined by hydroxymethylfurfural analysis. Average values of total antioxidant capacity ranged (12. 75 - 137. 49) mmol. 100 g- 1. Average values of total phenolic ranged (8. 51 - 61. 34) mg. 100 g- 1 and average values of total flavonoids ranged (0. 75 - 6. 04) mg. 100 g- 1. Honey samples contained (41. 83 - 585. 10) g. 100 g- 1 of rutin, (9. 30 - 313. 40) g. 100 g- 1 of myricetin, (6. 5 - 171. 90) g. 100 g- 1 of luteolin, (3. 19 - 436. 37) g. 100 g- 1 of quercetin, (2. 10 - 242. 66) g. 100 g- 1 of apigenin, (0. 15 - 105. 12) g. 100 g- 1 of caempferol and (0. 07 - 17. 52) mg. 100 g- 1 of naringenin. From group of catechins there were measured (5. 98 - 310) g. 100 g- 1 of catechin, (17. 77 - 486. 29) g. 100 g- 1 of epicatechin, (0. 18 - 64. 90) g. 100 g- 1 of catechin gallate and (0. 59 - 140. 56) g. 100 g- 1 of epicatechin gallate. From lipophilic compounds the most abundant in honey samples was tocopherol, its value ranged (29. 20 - 8531. 17) g. 100 g- 1. Content of ascorbic acid ranged (0. 65 - 4. 65) mg. 100 g- 1. Content of hydroxymethyl. furfural. ranged (0. 26 - 4. 06) mg. 100 g- 1. By LC/MS method luteolin, naringenin, protocatechin acid, coffee acid and p-cumaric acid in honeydew were detected and, furthermore, kyanidin and pinocembrin in floral honey were found. <b>Mono-floral</b> <b>honey</b> contained biologically active compounds the most, imperceptibly less contained multi-floral honey and honeydew honey. Acacia honey contained the lowest amount of biologically active compounds...|$|E
