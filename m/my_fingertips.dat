6000|$|He was a spare, tough young man, {{his dark}} hair was {{straight}} and fine, and his face, a trifle pale, was smooth and carefully drawn. He stammered a little, blushing when he did so, at long intervals. I scarcely know how he appeared on shipboard, but on shore, in his civilian's garb, which was of the neatest, he had {{as little as possible}} an aroma of winds and waves. He was neither salt nor brown, nor red, nor particularly [...] "hearty." [...] He never twitched up his trousers, nor, so far as one could see, did he, with his modest, attentive manner, carry himself as one accustomed to command. Of course, as a subaltern, he had more to do in the way of obeying. He looked as if he followed some sedentary calling, and was, indeed, supposed to be decidedly intellectual. He was a lamb with women, to whose charms he was, as I have hinted, susceptible; but with men he was different, and, I believe, as much of a wolf as was necessary. He had a manner of adoring the handsome, insolent queen of his affections (I will explain in a moment why I call her insolent); indeed, he looked up to her literally as well as sentimentally; for she was the least bit the taller of the two. He had met her the summer before, on the piazza of a hotel at Fort Hamilton, to which, with a brother officer, in a dusty buggy, he had driven over from Brooklyn to spend a tremendously hot Sunday,--the kind of day when the navy-yard was loathsome; and the acquaintance had been renewed by his calling in Twelfth Street on New-Year's Day,--a considerable time to wait for a pretext, but which proved the impression had not been transitory. The acquaintance ripened, thanks to a zealous cultivation (on his part) of occasions which Providence, it must be confessed, placed at his disposal none too liberally; so that now Georgina took up all his thoughts and a considerable part of his time. He was in love with her, beyond a doubt; but he could not flatter himself that {{she was in love with}} him, though she appeared willing (what was so strange) to quarrel with her family about him. He did n't see how she could really care for him,--she seemed marked out by nature for so much greater a fortune; and he used to say to her, [...] "Ah, you don't--there's no use talking, you don't--really care for me at all!" [...] To which she answered, [...] "Really? You are very particular. It seems to me it's real enough if I let you touch one of <b>my</b> <b>fingertips!</b> [...] "That was one of her ways of being insolent Another was simply her manner of looking at him, or at other people (when they spoke to her), with her hard, divine blue eye,--looking quietly, amusedly, with the air of considering (wholly from her own point of view) what they might have said, and then turning her head or her back, while, without taking the trouble to answer them, she broke into a short, liquid, irrelevant laugh. This may seem to contradict what I said just now about her taking the young lieutenant in the navy seriously. What I mean is that she appeared to take him more seriously than she took anything else. She said to him once, [...] "At any rate you have the merit of not being a shop-keeper;" [...] and it was by this epithet she was pleased to designate most of the young men who at that time flourished in the best society of New York. Even if she had rather a free way of expressing general indifference, a young lady is supposed to be serious enough when she consents to marry you. For the rest, as regards a certain haughtiness that might be observed in Geoigina Gressie, my story will probably throw sufficient light upon it She remarked to Benyon once that it was none of his business why she liked him, but that, to please herself, she did n't mind telling him she thought the great Napoleon, before he was celebrated, before he had command of the army of Italy, must have looked something like him; and she sketched in a few words the sort of figure she imagined the incipient Bonaparte to have been,--short, lean, pale, poor, intellectual, and with a tremendous future under his hat Benyon asked himself whether he had a tremendous future, and what in the world Geoigina expected of him in the coming years. He was flattered at the comparison, he was ambitious enough not to be frightened at it, and he guessed that she perceived a certain analogy between herself and the Empress Josephine. She would make a very good empress. That was true; Georgina was remarkably imperial. This may not at first seem to make it more clear why she should take into her favor an aspirant who, on the face of the matter, was not original, and whose Corsica was a flat New England seaport; but it afterward became plain that he owed his brief happiness--it was very brief--to her father's opposition; her father's and her mother's, and even her uncles' and her aunts'. In those days, in New York, the different members of a family took an interest in its alliances, and the house of Gressie looked askance at an engagement between the most beautiful of its daughters and a young man who was not in a paying business. Georgina declared that they were meddlesome and vulgar,--she could sacrifice her own people, in that way, without a scruple,--and Benyon's position improved from the moment that Mr. Gressie--ill-advised Mr. Gressie--ordered the girl to have nothing to do with him. Georgina was imperial in this--that she wouldn't put up with an order. When, in the house in Twelfth Street, it began to be talked about that she had better be sent to Europe with some eligible friend, Mrs. Portico, for instance, who was always planning to go, and who wanted as a companion some young mind, fresh from manuals and extracts, to serve as a fountain of history and geography,--when this scheme for getting Georgina out of the way began to be aired, she immediately said to Raymond Benyon, [...] "Oh, yes, I 'll marry you!" [...] She said it in such an off-hand way that, deeply as he desired her, he was almost tempted to answer, [...] "But, my dear, have you really thought about it?" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to fields like psychology and reading, {{the field of}} special education technology is a relatively young discipline. As a result, we lack the sophisticated research analysis tools that define the knowledge base in more established fields.

A hierarchy was devised and the outliers in the pack of multiples became fair game. I allowed myself to experiment without boundaries. Combating materials and interests played a strong role within this body of work. This allowed me insight into the cause and effect of the choices I was making. I denied any material the right to function as a historical marker. I deprived them of their nature and transformed their meaning.

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} written in five parts. These include a diversity paper, a zoogeography paper, two taxonomy papers, and a catalogue. Although each paper is a separate entity, they are all inherently related. The foundation of the thesis {{is a series of}} collections made between southern New Zealand and McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, intermittently from December 1970 to February 1973. They have formed the basis of the diversity study and raised the questions on which the rest of the thesis depends. Sorting, identifying and counting the animals in the collections has been a long slow job, broken up by other shorter studies presented here and elsewhere. The zoogeography study was undertaken {{to gain a better understanding}} of the origin and present day distribution of Antarctic Amphipoda and Polychaeta, the two main groups in the diversity study. Much of this work consisted of searching the literature and compiling distribution records which were sorted by the computer into areal checklists. The mechanics for this line of research are now worked out and I hope to continue it for other Antarctic invertebrate groups with the objective of looking for large scale zoogeographic trends. As the zoogeography study progressed it became apparent that the literature on Southern Ocean amphipods was badly in need of unification. Since I had most of the literature at <b>my</b> <b>fingertips,</b> and since I had to determine synonymies and distributions for the zoogeography study I decided to formalize this information into a catalogue, which was subsequently done with the help of Miss Suzanne Bullock. The catalogue was compiled on a computer and is very easy to update as new information becomes available. This makes it a continuous record of published information on Southern Ocean Amphipoda. The two amphipod taxonomy papers came directly from the collections for the diversity study. Unfortunately they describe only a small proportion of the new species in the collections. I anticipate describing more of these species at a later date, along with other new amphipod species collected by Dr Horning and me, particularly in the New Zealand Subantarctic. As for the other kinds of invertebrates in the collections, some are already being studied by specialists or have been given to museums, and this is the eventual fate of the entire collection...|$|E
40|$|When I first {{decided on}} my senior thesis, I {{was sitting in}} the {{basement}} of Teachers College in a five-week summer course taught by Dr. Linda E. Martin. During these five weeks, I absorbed as much knowledge as possible in regards to teaching reading to students. We discussed a variety of strategies, reading theories, and activities to use in the classroom. But, I felt that the five weeks was not long enough to learn all that I could to prepare myself for the classroom. It was when Dr. martin introduced Patricia Cunningham and the four Blocks method that I realized I had found my thesis project. I began my research on this concept in March 2001 and prepared my proposal for my thesis. I like the Four Blocks method as a teaching approach to teaching reading and writing, but I felt there was something missing. After discussing ideas with Dr. Martin, I finalized my thesis proposal. I would complete a project on integrating the curriculum within the Four Blocks method. I decided that I would look at two subjects that are often skipped or briefly touched on in an elementary classroom: social studies and science. I wanted to create a unit that incorporated Cunningham’s model into the curriculum. After choosing a unit on American Presidents and Measurement, I began my research on the integration of curriculum and the Four Blocks method. After extensive research and a firm understanding of these concepts, I started designing the units I would teach during my student teaching semester (Spring 2002). The process of designing seemed too easy. The lesson plans seemed to flow, the writing ideas were superfluous, and the standards were easily identified in the lessons I designed. I knew this was too easy to be true. When it came time to gather resources for the Guided Reading block, I soon found that my trade books I anticipated to find in the school and public library as well as the bookstores, were not at <b>my</b> <b>fingertips.</b> In fact, they were almost nowhere to be found for second grade reading levels. The lack of resources made it very difficult to succeed. However, through manipulation of my lessons and careful reconstruction of the objectives, I managed to alter the Guided Reading block to be a very successful learning time for my students. The Four Blocks method created by Patricia Cunningham seems too logical. I ask myself, “Why hasn’t the education system been using this for years?” the answer, however, is just as simple. Teachers are unwilling to change. New ideas are preposterous to many of the veteran teachers. It takes too much time and energy to creating a classroom that uses Cunningham’s theories to teach children reading, writing, and even listening skills. While Cunningham’s theory and practice {{is a step in the}} right direction, it is simply not enough. Through careful planning, I developed units that integrated the four Blocks method into curriculum that is often missed because of time. Teachers state they do not have time to include social studies, science, and even current events. But, by developing units that discuss these disciplines, while teaching reading, writing, and listening skills, teachers are able to teach the curriculum that is necessary. Even though the Four Blocks method breaks reading and writing into four blocks, it does not mean that these four blocks should be isolated in the classroom. These are different concepts that are used to teach reading and writing. The best way I found to teach the Four Blocks method is to not only integrate the curriculum into the Four Blocks, but to integrate the four blocks within each other. Isolation of any teaching style tends to bore children and make the work monotonous. With careful planning and decision-making, teachers will be able to make the classroom a spontaneous, interesting classroom for students. By no means is Cunningham’s model the sole way to teach. Nor is the integration of curriculum into models such as the Four Blocks method. But I assure you that through clareful planning, time commitment, and a little creativity, teachers are able to build successful units that capture the interest of the students, while teaching the standards that are required by the state. Learning may occur through worksheets, book work, and basals, but how involved are the children? As educators, we have the right and responsibility not only to teach our students but to make them lifelong learners. Will worksheets and lectures make our students lifelong learners? Or will the integration of curriculum into the development and teaching of reading, writing, and listening skills intrigue our students to be dedicated to the fulfillment of learning? The decision is yours. Honors CollegeThesis (B. A. ...|$|E
