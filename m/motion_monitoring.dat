50|$|Human {{activity}} {{recognition is}} {{most commonly used}} for video surveillance, specifically automatic <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring</b> for security purposes. Most efforts in this area rely on state-space approaches, in which sequences of static postures are statistically analyzed and compared to modeled movements. Template-matching is an alternative method whereby static shape patterns are compared to pre-existing prototypes. Human motion tracking can be performed {{in two or three}} dimensions. Depending on the complexity of analysis, representations of the human body range from basic stick figures to volumetric models. Tracking relies on the correspondence of image features between consecutive frames of video, taking into consideration information such as position, color, shape, and texture. Edge detection can be performed by comparing the color and/or contrast of adjacent pixels, looking specifically for discontinuities or rapid changes. Three-dimensional tracking is fundamentally identical to two-dimensional tracking, with the added factor of spatial calibration.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive {{collaborative}} {{control is}} most accurately modeled as a {{closed loop feedback}} control system. Closed loop feedback control describes the event where the outputs of a system from an input are used to influence the present or future behavior of the system. The feedback control model is governed {{by a set of}} equations that are used to predict the future state of the simuland and regulate its behavior. These equations - in conjunction with principles of control theory - are used to evolve physical operations of the simuland to include, but not limited to: dialogue, path planning, <b>motion,</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and lifting objects over time. Many times, these equations are modeled as nonlinear partial differential equations over a continuous time domain. Due to their complexity, powerful computers are necessary to implement these models. A consequence of using computers to simulate these models is that continuous systems cannot be fully calculated. Instead, numerical solutions, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, are utilized to approximate these continuous models. These equations are initialized from the response of one or more sources and rates of changes and outputs are calculated. These rates of changes predict the states of the simuland a short time in the future. The time increment for this prediction is called a time step. These new states are applied to the model to determine the new rates of changes and observational data. This behavior is continued until the desired number of iterations is completed. In the event a future state violates or comes within a tolerance of the violation the simuland will confer with its human counterpart seeking advice on how to proceed from that point. The outputs, or observational data, are used by the human operators to determine what they believe is the best course of action for the simuland. Their commands are fed with the input into the control system and assessed regarding its effectiveness in resolving the issues. If the human commands are determined to be valuable, the simuland will adjust its control input to what the human suggested. If the human’s commands are determined to be unbeneficial, malicious, or non-existent, the model will seek its own correction approach.|$|E

40|$|In {{treatment}} of motion affected tumours {{by means of}} a scanned particle beam severe under and over dosage can occur due to the interplay effect. By using gated beam delivery effective target motion is reduced, but even for the residual motion the interplay effect can lead to unsatisfactory dose distributions. Furthermore, an appropriate <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is essential since beam delivery has to be synchronized to target motion. In this work three aspects were investigated to move gating closer towards clinical operation at Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) : Firstly, influences of beam parameters on dosimetric effects of residual motion were investigated in experiments and simulations. Increased focus sizes and reduced iso-energy distances {{turned out to be an}} effective method to gain dose homogeneity whereas reduction of lateral beam position spacing did not show such an effect. Secondly, to enable systematic studies of mitigation techniques and effects of miscorrelation between <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring</b> system and tumour motion a phantom with 6 D target and independent thorax motion was constructed and validated successfully in experiments. Thirdly, two <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems by VisionRT Ltd. and Anzai Medical Co.,Ltd., respectively, were compared in terms of gating delays and correlation to tumour motion extracted from MV-fluoroscopy. While the VisionRT system showed larger delays than the Anzai system under laboratory conditions, no significant difference between the systems with respect to tumour-correlation was found in a clinical study. Results of this work will be incorporated into patient treatments using gating that will start at HIT within the next few months.

40|$|Enabling {{large-scale}} {{monitoring and}} classification {{of a range}} of motion activities is of primary importance due to the need by healthcare and fitness professionals to monitor exercises for quality and compliance. Video based motion capturing systems (e. g., VICON cameras) provide a partial solution. However, these expensive and fixed systems are not suitable for patients' at-home daily <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Wireless motion sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, can provide a low-cost, small-size, and highly-mobile option. However, acquiring robust inference of human motion trajectory via low-cost inertial sensors remains challenging. Sensor noise and drift, sensor placement errors and variation of activity over the population all lead to the necessity of a large amount of data collection. Unfortunately, such a large amount of data collection is prohibitively costly. In observance of these issues, a series of solutions for robust human <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring</b> and activity classification will be presented. The implementation of a real-time context-guided activity classification system will be discussed. To facilitate ground truth data acquisition, we proposed a virtual inertial measurements platform to convert the currently available MoCap database into a noiseless and error-free inertial measurements database. An opportunistic calibration system which deals with sensor placement errors will be discussed. In addition, a sensor fusion approach for robust upper limb motion tracking will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|Cycle-to-cycle {{variations}} in respiratory motion can cause significant geometric and dosimetric {{errors in the}} administration of lung cancer radiation therapy. A common limitation of the current strategies for motion management is that they assume a constant, reproducible respiratory cycle. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using rapid MRI for providing long-term imaging of the thorax in order to better capture cycle-to-cycle variations. Two nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients were imaged (free-breathing, no extrinsic contrast, and 1. 5 [*]T scanner). A balanced steady-state-free-precession (b-SSFP) sequence was used to acquire cine- 2 D and cine- 3 D (4 D) images. In the case of Patient 1 (right midlobe lesion, ~ 40 [*]mm diameter), tumor motion was well correlated with diaphragmatic motion. In the case of Patient 2, (left upper-lobe lesion, ~ 60 [*]mm diameter), tumor motion was poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion. Furthermore, the motion of the tumor centroid was poorly correlated with the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary, indicating significant rotation and/or deformation. These studies indicate that image quality and acquisition speed of cine- 2 D MRI were adequate for <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring.</b> However, significant improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4 D MRI. Despite several challenges, rapid MRI offers a feasible and attractive tool for noninvasive, long-term <b>motion</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|E
