Direct measurements of the kinetic behavior of the hexasaccharides, octasaccharides, and decasaccharides showed that these fractions greatly enhanced the rate of Factor Xa inactivation by antithrombin. Indeed, these species exhibited specific <b>molar</b> <b>activities</b> that ranged from 6. 9 % (hexaccharide) to 60. 9 % (decasaccharide) of that of the heparin fragment of approximately 16 residues. However, these oligosaccharides exhibited essentially no ability to accelerate thrombin-antithrombin interactions. The avidity of the hexasaccharides, octasaccharides, and decasaccharides for the protease inhibitor increased {{as a function of}} size with the respective dissociation constants ranging from 5. 5 X 10 (- 6) M to 2. 9 X 10 (- 7) M. These data suggest that the region of the heparin molecule needed for catalyzing Factor Xa-antithrombin interaction is intimately related to the antithrombin binding domain. The smallest complex carbohydrate fragment that accelerated the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin had approximately 14 residues. This fraction had an avidity for the protease inhibitor of 2. 8 X 10 (- 7) M and specific <b>molar</b> <b>activities</b> of 140 units per mumol (thrombin neutralization) and 460 units per mumol (factor Xa inactivation).

40|$|Two related human alpha interferons with 83 % {{homology}} {{in their}} primary sequences show a similar specific activity on nonhuman cells, but a striking difference on human cells, on which alpha- 1 shows 1 - 5 % {{of the specific}} <b>molar</b> <b>activity</b> displayed by alpha- 2. Both interferons were labelled with 125 I, and their binding kinetics followed on growing cultures of the human Burkitt line Daudi. Binding of alpha- 1 showed slower rates of association and faster rates of dissociation implying that differences in apparent binding affinity {{were responsible for the}} differences in specific <b>molar</b> <b>activity.</b> However, binding was shown to reach steady-state rather than an equilibrium, so differences in the dynamics of the ligand-receptor complexes may represent amplification of differences in the initial binding constant. alpha- 2, but not alpha- 1, induces a marked loss of binding sites leading to a high affinity steady-state binding. Inhibition of cell multiplication by both interferons depends on a continued stimulation by free ligands at steady-state.

Tx rats were treated daily for 3 weeks with 0. 15 M NaCl (solvent vehicle) or L-thyroxine (T 4). Two doses of T 4, 10 and 100 micrograms/day/kg BW, were used. Sham Tx rats were treated with 0. 15 M NaCl. All animals were studied on the day following the last treatment. The mass of TH was determined using an immunoblot assay, and the in situ activity of TH was calculated from the rate of intracellular accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) after administration of an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase activity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{evaluate}} previously proposed {{functions of}} renal caveolar Na + /K +-ATPase, we modified the standard {{procedures for the}} preparation of the purified membrane-bound kidney enzyme, separated the caveolar and noncaveolar pools, and compared their properties. While the subunits of Na + /K +-ATPase (α,β,γ) constituted most of the protein content of the noncaveolar pool, the caveolar pool also contained caveolins and major caveolar proteins annexin- 2 tetramer and E-cadherin. Ouabain-sensitive Na + /K +-ATPase activities of the two pools had similar properties and equal <b>molar</b> <b>activities,</b> indicating that the caveolar enzyme retains its ion transport function and does not contain nonpumping enzyme. As minor constituents, both caveolar and noncaveolar pools also contained Src, EGFR, PI 3 K, and several other proteins known to be involved in stimulous-induced signaling by Na + /K +-ATPase, indicating that signaling function {{is not limited to the}} caveolar pool. Endogenous Src was active in both pools but was not further activated by ouabain, calling into question direct interaction of Src with native Na + /K +-ATPase. Chemical cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunodetection studies showed that in the caveolar pool, caveolin- 1 oligomers, annexin- 2 tetramers, and oligomers of the α,β,γ-protomers of Na + /K +-ATPase form a large multiprotein complex.

30|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) belongs {{to the family of}} receptor tyrosine kinases {{and is one of the}} most frequently overexpressed proteins in malignant tumors (Ciardiello and Tortora 2008). Therefore, it has become an attractive target for cancer treatment. In this regard, EGFR specific antibodies such as cetuximab (Erbitux®) as well as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib (Iressa®) and erlotinib (Tarceva®, OSI- 774) have been developed. Erlotinib reached marketing authorization in 2004 and belongs to the first-generation reversible TKIs (Cohen et al. 2005). It is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer (Singh and Jadhav 2017). One crucial parameter for prediction of treatment response is the mutational status of the EGFR. In order to identify the subset of patients who will benefit from therapy with erlotinib, positron emission tomography (PET) with [11 C]erlotinib has been proposed (Memon et al. 2009; Bahce et al. 2013; Petrulli et al. 2013; Slobbe et al. 2015). Owing to the short radioactive half-life of carbon- 11 (t 1 / 2  =  20.4  min), a short overall synthesis time is desirable as it determines absolute radiochemical yields and <b>molar</b> <b>activities.</b> Hence, every adaption in the radiosynthesis protocol reducing the synthesis time significantly improves the outcome. Additionally, depending on the intended use of the radiotracer (i.e. preclinical or clinical), different approaches for formulation of the final product may be required. For example, higher doses in an overall larger volume are applied in patients, whereas in small animal studies the volume of injection is very limited and therefore, a higher concentration of the PET tracer is required.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Nitric oxide (NO), an {{important}} signalling molecule {{in the human}} body, is synthesised by three isoforms of NO-synthase (NOS) from the amino acid L-arginine. Overproduction of NO by neuronal NOS {{has been associated with}} neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, developing small molecules for selective inhibition of nNOS over related isoforms (iNOS and eNOS) is therapeutically desirable and of great interest for decoding neurodestructive key factors [1]. Suitable 18 F-labelled NOS-Inhibitors should allow the investigation of NOS-function by molecular imaging. Potentially, the highly selective nNOS Inhibitor 6 -((3 -((3 -fluorophenylethylamino) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) - 4 -methyl-pyridine- 2 -amine [2] is a suitable target for labelling with n. c. a. [18 F]fluoride in addition to the established iNOS inhibitor 6 -(2 -[18 F]fluoropropyl) - 4 -methylpyridine- 2 -amine [3]. Methods: Based on tert-butyl-(3 -iodophenylethyl) carbamate the corresponding iodoniumylide precursor was formed [4]. The activated aromatic system was labelled with n. c. a. [18 F]fluoride and converted via reductive amination followed by microwave assisted displacement of the protecting groups to the desired nNOS inhibitor. For the development of a simplified late-stage labelling procedure the corresponding brominated, Boc- and pyrrole-protected compound was synthesised, which was converted via borylation into the boronic ester precursor. This compound was labelled authentically by copper(II) mediated n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination [5]. Further developments enabled the one-pot synthesis by adapting the [18 F]fluoride activation to the radiolabelling step leading to ready-to-automate conditions. Furthermore, an automated one-pot procedure for the synthesis of the iNOS-Inhibitor was examined after stability tests and kinetic studies. Results: The n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination of the iodoniumylide precursor proceeded efficiently and regioselective in 79 % radiochemical yield (RCY). The following built-up synthesis led to the desired nNOS inhibitor in 15 % RCY. First attempts of the late-stage copper(II) mediated n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination led to similar conversions. The labelling procedure was reduced to a simplified one-pot synthesis. Conclusion: Finally, there are now potential and isoform selective radiotracers for both inducible and neuronal NO-synthases with high <b>molar</b> <b>activities</b> for further evaluations and preclinical studies.

In order to overcome sugars insolubility in hexane, sugars were introduced in the reaction mixture preabsorbed on silica gel. The chemical structure of the products has been determined by 1 H NMR analysis. The two enzymes tested seemed to prefer hexoses rather than pentoses as the sugar substrate. They exhibited different water activity optimums as well as different optimum sugar/acyl donor <b>molar</b> ratios. Water <b>activity</b> control throughout the reaction and temperature increase from 30 to 50 °C enhanced sugar ester production using both lipases.
