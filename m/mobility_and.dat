40|$|This paper {{integrates}} a <b>mobilities</b> perspective <b>and</b> Lefebvre’s {{notion of}} rhythmanalysis {{as a means}} interrogate place as an entanglement of <b>mobilities,</b> moorings, <b>and</b> rhythms. By investigating one popular rock climbing destination, this paper demonstrates that mobilities invite encounters with and enactments of place such that travel rhythms, everyday rhythms, and natural rhythms coalesce, interrupt, and even emerge anew. Focusing on lifestyle rock climbers (a particular type of lifestyle mobility dedicated {{to the pursuit of}} climbing) and events provides evidence for the ways informational <b>and</b> physical <b>mobilities</b> contribute to <b>and</b> even regiment rock climbing travel rhythms, while the everyday rhythms of place illustrate embodiment as crucial to the enfolding of rhythm <b>and</b> <b>mobilities.</b> Building from Lefebvre’s theory of rhythm and Edensor and Holloway’s (2008) re-articulation of its potential for mobilities studies, this paper emphasizes the ongoing relationality of embodied <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> bodily rhythms, seasonal rhythms <b>and</b> informational <b>mobilities,</b> collective <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> institutional rhythms...|$|R

A particular emphasis is put on how <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> dislocation – in effect ‘being stuck’ in a northern wilderness – were intertwined and how the inhabitants of the camp coped with the situation, as well as how this is reflected in the different features of the camp itself and the archaeological material that the fieldwork produced...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{extraction}} of transport parameters as <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> diffusivities {{has been a}} subject of research for more than 20 years. However, the solutions proposed up to now are not satisfactory particularly when applied to nanoscale devices. In this brief, we review the two most popular methods to extract <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> show how they fail in nanoscale devices, where transport is strongly quasi-ballistic. We also show that these methods are not appropriate to extract tensorial transport parameters. As an alternative, we propose to use recently derived general definitions of <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> diffusivities that naturally solve these problems and, thus, constitute a universal method to extract transport parameters.

The behavior of the colloidal particles' diffusion constant can be well understood in terms of two coupled effects: counterion 'condensation' and slowdown due to the relaxation effect. We find that the conductivity exhibits a maximum which approximately separates the regimes of counterion-dominated and colloid-dominated conduction. We analyze the electrophoretic <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> the conductivity in terms of commonly employed assumptions about the role of "free" and "condensed" counterions, and discuss different interpretations of this approach.

Despite wider agendas of <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> integration, consumption is found to reflect visitors' nationalities and affinities. Consumption is successfully modelled by combining nationality with a further dimension of cultural familiarity, heritage consumption. From the qualitative and quantitative analysis, visitors are segmented into two main groups: re-iteratives and make-believers...|$|R

40|$|Mobilities of people, capital, labour, expertise, {{resources}} and images create significant challenges for sustainable destination governance. This paper discusses {{the implications of}} mobilities for destination governance where fluid populations of tourists, residents, second home owners and recreationists, and transnational flows of labour and capital intersect to create and recreate the physical, social, economic and political characteristics of place. Three key processes that affect destination management are identified: the spatial restructuring of destinations, the pluralisation of destination management and the re-envisioning of community. In {{a study of the}} hyper-neoliberal destination of the Gold Coast, Australia, <b>mobilities</b> are examined <b>and</b> implications for governance are discussed. Our research highlights the challenges of measuring, evaluating and understanding the extent <b>and</b> complexity of <b>mobilities,</b> <b>and</b> explores the tensions between <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> established sustainable tourism principles that suggest governance should be grounded in local community dialogue and values. The differences between “hard” and “soft” power structures in destination governance are noted. The paper contributes methodological insights into the study of <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> to theoretical and practical debates about the influence of mobilities on sustainable destination management, especially the need to re-visit the meanings of long-accepted concepts in sustainable tourism, including “public interest”, “community” and “community-based” tourism...|$|R
