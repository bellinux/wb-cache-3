2500|$|High-dosage NET {{has been}} used to {{suppress}} menstruation in women with severe intellectual disability who were incapable of handling their own menses. A study of 118 nulliparous women treated with 5mg/day NET for a period of 2 to 30 months found that the drug was effective in producing amenorrhea in 86% of the women, with breakthrough bleeding occurring in the remaining 14%. Side effects including weight gain, hirsutism, acne, headache, nausea, and vomiting all did not appear to increase in incidence and no [...] "disturbing side effects" [...] were noted in any of the women. Another study of 5mg/day NET in 132 women also made no mention of androgenic side effects. These findings suggest little to no risk of androgenic side effects with NET at a dosage of 5mg/day. A study of 194 women treated with 5 to 15mg/day NETA for a median duration of 13 months of therapy to suppress symptoms of endometriosis observed no side effects in 55.2% of patients, weight gain in 16.1%, acne in 9.9%, <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> in 8.9%, hot flashes in 8.3%, and voice deepening in two women (1.0%).|$|E

Adjusted analysis was conducted, controlling for possible confounding factors. The symptoms most frequently reported by the women from the 1982 Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, birth cohort who were interviewed in 2004 - 2005 were: irritability (52. 3 %) and anxiety (40. 2 %). The prevalence rates for moderate and severe premenstrual syndrome were 13. 4 % and 5. 8 %, respectively. Mean age at menarche was 12. 4 (± 1. 5) years. Prevalence rates for symptoms and premenstrual syndrome were higher in women whose age at menarche was less than 11 years, but this difference was not statistically significant.

40|$|To date, {{there has}} been little {{investigation}} of the neurobiological basis of emotion processing abnormalities in psychiatric populations. We have previously discussed two neural systems: 1) a ventral system, including the amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, ventral anterior cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal cortex, for identification of the emotional significance of a stimulus, production of affective states, and automatic regulation of emotional responses; and 2) a dorsal system, including the hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal cortex, for the effortful regulation of affective states and subsequent behavior. In this critical review, we have examined evidence from studies employing a variety of techniques for distinct patterns of structural and functional abnormalities in these neural systems in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. In each psychiatric disorder, the pattern of abnormalities may be associated with specific symptoms, including emotional flattening, anhedonia, and persecutory delusions in schizophrenia, prominent <b>mood</b> swings, emotional <b>lability,</b> and distractibility in bipolar disorder during depression and mania, and with depressed mood and anhedonia in major depressive disorder. We suggest that distinct patterns of structural and functional abnormalities in neural systems important for emotion processing are associated with specific symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar and major depressive disorder...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Human {{reasoning}} originates both as in a propositional way {{following the}} inferential laws of formal logic, as analogically according to Johnson-Laird Theory of Mental Models (TMM), {{with the construction}} of the premises through a mental model (in the form of representation of a specific problem), and subsequent manipulations until the review of the premises through the selection and reduction (contextual restrictors) of these models in comparison with evidence to the contrary (counterarguments). The aim of the present paper is to better understand if delusional thought (mainly of paranoid type) {{is at the end of}} the spectrum of heuristic thinking biases (in particular of social and attributional biases), rather than regard it as a discontinuity from the form of thought shared among individuals. Methods: Cochrane analysis of the literature with following key words: euristic biases, paranoid delusions, self-esteem, moral disengagement. Results: Literature data are sufficiently unique in considering that among the factors that interfere with the process of restriction, favoring the onset of delusional thinking, as well as some mental states (anger, <b>mood</b> swings, emotional <b>lability,</b> fear, anxiety), might be considered heuristic biases that are intended to preserve the self-esteem (either an overt or deep). Conclusions: The interest of our hypothesis is that what we consider to be clinically more severe (delusions) may in fact represent only the tip of the iceberg in a series of sub-threshold thinking disorders, which, just because it is very common and socially accepted, represent a more serious kind of human miscommunication, also justifying dangerous behaviour derived from moral disengagement. A unitary hypothesis that links sub-threshold thoughts disorder to delusions is that it serves to preserve our self-esteem, at least from a psychological point of view...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{variety and}} extent of {{impairments}} occurring after traumatic brain injury {{vary according to the}} nature and severity of the lesions. In order to better understand their interactions and long-term outcome, we have studied and compared the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile one year post onset of patients with and without traumatic brain injury in a cohort of motor vehicle accident victims. MethodThe study population is composed of 207 seriously injured persons from the ESPARR cohort. This cohort, which has been followed up in time, consists in 1168 motor vehicle accident victims (aged 16 years or more) with injuries with all degrees of severity. Inclusion criteria were: living in Rhone county, victim of a traffic accident having involved at least one wheel-conducted vehicle and having occurred in Rhone county, alive at the time of arrival in hospital and having presented in one of the different ER facilities of the county. The cohort's representativeness regarding social and geographic criteria and the specificities of the accidents were ensured by the specific targeting of recruitment. Deficits and impairments were assessed one year after the accident using the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale - Revised and the Trail-Making Test. Within our seriously injured group, based on the Glasgow Score, the presence of neurological deficits, aggravation of neurological condition in the first 72 hours and/or abnormal cerebral imaging, we identified three categories: (i) moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (n= 48), (ii) mild traumatic brain injury (n= 89), and (iii) severely injured but without traumatic brain injury (n= 70). ResultsThe most frequently observed symptoms were anxiety, irritability, memory and attention impairments, depressive <b>mood</b> and emotional <b>lability.</b> While depressive <b>mood</b> and irritability were observed with similar frequency in all three groups, memory and attention impairments, anxiety and reduced initiative were more specific to traumatic brain injury whereas executive disorders were associated with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury. Discussion-ConclusionThe presence and the initial severity of a traumatic brain injury condition the nature and frequency of residual effects after one year. Some impairments such as irritability, which is generally associated with traumatic brain injury, {{do not appear to be}} specific to this population, nor does depressive mood.

40|$|Background: Mixed {{depression}} (MxD) is one subtype {{of depressive}} experiences within the depressive spectrum. MxD definition is debated among experts. Koukopoulos proposed diagnostic criteria {{focused primarily on}} psychic agitation, marked irritability, and intense <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> as markers of a mixed depressive episode. The present study vandal:es Koukopoulos' criteria as diagnostic for MxD. Methods: A sample of 435 patients from the International Mood Network (IMN), multi center. infernational network of sites, and the Centro LucioBini of Rome was analyzed. Koukopoulos' criteria were assessed in all patients. Results: The most prevalent MxD criteria were "absence of psychomotor retardation" (84 %), "mood lability or marked reactivity" (78 %), and "psychic agitation or inner tension" (75 %). Multivariable predictors of a MxD (+) diagnosis were: higher current CGI (OR= 1. 23, 95 % CI 123, 2. 84), lower rates of previous bipolar type I diagnosis (OR= 0. 54, 95 % Cl 3. 28, - 0. 13), mixed symptoms on the index episode (OR= 10. 02, 95 % Cl 2. 32, 24. 12), rapid cycling course (OR= 2. 6 95 % Cl 1. 45, 3. 56), past substance abuse (OR= 3. 02, 95 % Cl 2. 01, 5. 67) and lower education status (OR= 0. 44, 95 % Cl - 3. 23, 0. 98). This model showed a sensitivity of 76. 4 %, specificity of 86. 3 %, negative predictive value of 75 %, and positive predictive value of 86 %. Limitations: An external validation of these criteria in an independent sample is warranted. Conclusion: A broad definition of mixed depression was internally validated with multiple diagnostic vandators and was sensitively and specifically predicted. Contrary to DSM- 5, Koukopoulos' broad criteria include agitation, irritability and <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> as core features. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{case report}} {{highlights}} {{the challenges in}} managing Frontal Lobe Syndrome (FLS) in a patient with end-stage renal disease.

40|$|Objective: To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} {{published}} case report of an adolescent girl with a mitochondrial disorder and depression who displayed both new-onset psychotic and in-creased mood symptoms during treatment with risperidone. Data: A 16 -year-old girl was treated with risperidone for <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> and impulsivity at a community hospital. Within days, she developed paranoid ideation, profound psychomotor retardation, increased depression, and fatigue. She was transferred to an inpatient psychi-atric hospital, where she was taken off risperidone. Within 48 hours after discontinuation of the medication, she had complete resolution of psychotic symptoms, fatigue, and psychomo-tor retardation, and her depression improved. Conclusions: This observation of “on-off ” risperidone treatment suggests that risperidone may have worsened both psychiatric and physical manifestations of the mitochondrial disor-der in this adolescent. These findings are consistent with recent in vitro literature, which im-plicate a series of neuroleptic medications with mitochondrial dysfunction.

In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 20 perinatal women (n at late pregnancy= 10; n in the early postpartum period= 10). While most of the sample reported adapting positively to body changes experienced during pregnancy, the postpartum period was often associated with body dissatisfaction. Women reported several events unique to pregnancy which helped them cope positively with bodily changes (e. g. increased perceived body functionality, new sense of meaning in life thus placing well-being of developing foetus above body aesthetics, perceptual experiences such as feeling baby kick, increased sense of social connectedness due to pregnancy body shape, and positive social commentary); however, these events no longer protected against body dissatisfaction post-birth. While women reported <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> throughout the perinatal period, the postpartum was also a time of increased positive affect for most women, and overall most women did not associate body changes with their mood.

40|$|Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a {{dysfunction}} in modifying {{an emotional}} state in an adaptive and goal oriented way, with excitability, ease anger, and <b>mood</b> <b>lability.</b> It {{is present in}} up to 70 % of adults with ADHD, regardless of other comorbidities, and substantially worsens the psychosocial outcomes of the disorder. Besides fronto-parietal circuits mediating top-down control, brain regions involved in bottom-up processes (e. g., amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum) are implicated in ED. We performed a systematic review/meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials of ADHD medications to assess their effects on ED in adults with ADHD. We searched an extensive set of databases, international trials registries, and contacted study authors/drug companies for unpublished data. We retained 21 trials.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how bipolar symptoms emerge during development, {{and the potential}} role of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions {{in the prevention of}} the onset of the disorder. Early signs of bipolarity can be observed among children of bipolar parents and often take the form of subsyndromal presentations (e. g., <b>mood</b> <b>lability,</b> episodic elation or irritability, depression, inattention, and psychosocial impairment). However, many of these early presentations are diagnostically nonspecific. The few studies that have followed at-risk youth into adulthood find developmental discontinuities from childhood to adulthood. Biological markers (e. g., amygdalar volume) may ultimately increase our accuracy in identifying children who later develop bipolar I disorder, but few such markers have been identified. Stress, in the form of childhood adversity or highly conflictual families, is not a diagnostically specific causal agent but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more pernicious course of illness. A preventative family-focused treatment for children with (a) at least one first-degree relative with bipolar disorder and (b) subsyndromal signs of bipolar disorder is described. This model attempts to address the multiple interactions of psychosocial and biological risk factors in the onset and course of bipolar disorder...|$|E
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} {{is a common}} neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder is}} not well understood. Neurochemical studies suggest, alterations in catecholaminergic, mainly dopaminergic and noradrenergic, transmitter functions markedly contribute to the symptoms of this disorder. The symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are significantly ameliorated by the agents that specifically influence these neurotransmitters. Animal studies implicate {{areas of the brain}} in which these neurotransmitters are most dominant. Psychostimulant medications are generally the first choice in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Approximately 70 % of the children treated show improvement in the primary attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and in comorbidity such as conduct disorder, although the benefits may not hold beyond two years. Despite the well-established efficacy and safety of stimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alternative medicines are still needed for several reasons. About 30 % of children and adolescents with this disorder may not respond to stimulants or may be unable to tolerate potential adverse events such as decreased appetite, <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> and sleep disturbances. Although stimulants do not increase the risk for later substance abuse in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, concerns have been raised about special prescription rules and a potential for abuse by persons other than the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subjects. This review focuses on etiology, assessment, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder...|$|E
40|$|Aggressive {{symptomatology}} presents {{across multiple}} psychiatric, developmental, neurological and behavioral disorders, complicating {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of the underlying pathology. Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) have become an appealing alternative in the treatment of aggression, <b>mood</b> <b>lability</b> and impulsivity in adult and pediatric populations, although few controlled trials have explored their efficacy in treating pediatric populations. This review of the literature synthesizes the available data on ten AEDs – valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide, gabapentin and tiagabine – in an attempt to assess evidence for the efficacy of AEDs in the treatment of aggression in pediatric populations. Our review revealed modest evidence that some of the AEDs produced improvement in pediatric aggression, but controlled trials in pediatric bipolar disorder have not been promising. Valproate is the best supported AED for aggression and should be considered as a first line of treatment. When monotherapy is insufficient, combining an AED with either lithium or an atypical anti-psychotic can result in better efficacy. Additionally, our review indicates that medications with predominately GABA-ergic mechanisms of action are not effective in treating aggression, and medications which decrease glutaminergic transmission tended to have more cognitive adverse effects. Agents with multiple mechanisms of action may be more effective...|$|E
30|$|A {{subgroup}} {{of patients in}} this cohort who began taking lithium when elderly recalls the case series of 10 patients described by Hagop Akiskal’s group of “elderly patients with late-onset mood and related behavioral symptomatology and cognitive decline without past history of clear-cut bipolar disorder”. The authors reported that “symptoms were often refractory to or aggravated by antidepressants…, whereas mood stabilizers and/or atypical antipsychotics were beneficial, promoting behavioral improvement in all treated patients and marked cognitive recovery in five”. Only one case had been treated with lithium (Ng et al. 2008). We did not measure cognition in the present study, but the above-mentioned subgroup {{had a history of}} behavioral dysregulation, <b>mood</b> <b>lability,</b> and cognitive symptoms that improved after withdrawing long-term antidepressant treatment and starting lithium. According to referring specialists, their choice of prescribing lithium was also based on its neuroprotective properties (Bauer et al. 2003). Interestingly, a longer duration of lithium treatment has been reported to be related to higher white matter integrity among elderly patients with bipolar disorder (Gildengers et al. 2015). In another study using voxel-based morphometry, Zung et al. (2016) found an increased left hippocampal volume in the lithium-treated group compared with the nonlithium-treated group, and decreased left hippocampal volume in the nonlithium group relative to controls.|$|E
