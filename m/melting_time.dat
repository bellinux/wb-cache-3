40|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to measure {{velocity}} in liquid metals. All of these efforts, however, share the same inherent limitation, namely, not being operative at the high temperatures required by liquid metals and liquid slags in an industrial application. In this paper, the current methods used were reviewed, and a new technique was presented for the measurement of velocity in high temperature liquid metals. In using this technique there are two stages. Starting with the calibration stage and then moving to the actual measurement stage by making use of the data obtained from calibration stage. Calibration proceeds in the following manner. Metallic spheres moving with a specific velocity are immersed in liquid metal held under isothermal conditions and at specific temperature. Their <b>melting</b> <b>times</b> are determined very accurately with a novel technique. These measurements are repeated for different metal bath temperatures and for different velocities of metallic spheres. In this manner it is possible to calculate the correlation between velocity and <b>melting</b> <b>times</b> for each metal bath temperature. During the actual measurement stage, when the metal bath temperature is known and its velocity is unknown, the magnitude of the unknown liquid metal velocity can be derived as follows: metallic spheres are immersed into the moving liquid metal and their <b>melting</b> <b>times</b> are determined. Using the above mentioned correlations, it will be shown that the magnitude of the unknown velocity in liquid metal can be deduced. This new technique was applied to high temperature liquid aluminum and liquid steel and these results were presented. The potential applicability of this technique in other liquid metals and liquid slags will also be discussed...|$|R
30|$|The <b>melt</b> <b>time</b> and {{the pulse}} {{repetition}} rate have {{significant influence on}} the growth of nanofibers. The lifetime of the molten material {{is determined by the}} time in which the energy diffuses into the substrate. The estimated <b>melt</b> <b>time</b> based on one-dimensional heat conduction model for glass varies between 0.4 and 0.8 μs [9], which is longer than the pulse separation time of 0.125 μs used in the present experiment. As a result, resolidification of molten material throughout the irradiation process is avoided. This helps for the continuous growth of the nanofibers with successive laser pulses. Furthermore at 2 MHz, the pulse separation time is 0.5 μs, which is longer than the <b>melt</b> <b>time,</b> only resolidified particles are observed on the irradiated surface. The forces acting on the molten material are interacting capillary forces coupled with thermal processes (Marangoni force) [8, 12] and hydrodynamic forces exerted by the plasma above the surface [13]. The temperature gradient on the molten surface, which follows the Gaussian intensity profile of the laser beam induces the thermocapillary flow [10]. The temperature gradient in turn creates surface tension gradient that drives material from the hot center to the cold periphery. This behavior is expected in most materials where the surface tension decreases as the fluid gets hotter in the center [10]. However, with glass the surface tension gradient is positive, and as a result the thermocapillary flow would actually drive fluid from the cold periphery to the hot center [14]. This is in contrast to the one observed in our experiments where the nanofibers are grown along and perpendicular to the substrate surface. By taking into account of the pressure gradient created by ablation plume, the fiber growth can be explained as follows.|$|R

Several matrices of experiments were constructed with cooling rate, <b>melt</b> <b>time,</b> and <b>melt</b> temperature as the principal variables. Variations in <b>melt</b> <b>time</b> and temperature above and below the stability temperatures of olivine (1198 °C) and plagioclase (1187 °C) produced different numbers of unmelted remnants of either olivine and plagioclase or just olivine.

The full range of textures produced by the range of cooling rates studied (0 - 5 °C to 50 °C/hr) can be produced at a single cooling rate just by varying the nucleating heterogeneities. These heterogeneities behave like unmelted remnants but smaller than can be seen in the optical microscope, probably less than 0 - 1 micrometers.
