5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different <b>meanings</b> <b>in</b> different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different <b>meanings</b> <b>in</b> two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

40|$|<b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> {{life has}} been {{identified}} as an important element of well-being. Recently attention has been directed to examining the differences between having <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life. Theory has speculated that if an individual is searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life, he/she may be distressed. Researchers of late have begun to focus on the process of searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life {{to gain a better understanding}} of the individual differences which may exist. Interest has also been directed towards exploring whether any moderators of the possible negative effects of the searching process may exist. This research investigated the hypothesised negative link between high levels of searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and subjective well-being and the positive moderating effects of presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life while also exploring the influence of the demographic variables which were treated as control variables. From an exploratory stance further analysis examined the hypothesised positive moderating effects of self-actualisation, self-efficacy and achievement motives on the relationship between searching for meaning and subjective well-being. One study (n = 500) was conducted to assess the hypothesized relationships. The study confirmed the negative relationship between high levels of searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and subjective well-being and positive moderating effects that presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and self-actualisation have on happiness scores when individuals are searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life. Self-efficacy and achievement motives were shown to have no significant moderating effects on searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and subjective wellbeing. Overall the results suggest that individuals who record high levels of searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life are protected from the negative outcomes of this process by holding high levels of presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and self-actualisation. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to introduce the concept of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and to provide evidence for why the concept is important in nursing. The specific aims were to: (1) develop and test an instrument to measure <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work, (2) explore direct relationships between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and nursing outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout), and (3) explore indirect relationships among <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work, the nursing work environment, and nursing outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout). Data were collected from surveys mailed to {{a convenience sample of}} 500 registered nurses (RNs) randomly selected from an RN list from the North Carolina Board of Nursing. To develop an instrument to measure theoretical constructs of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work, items from four instruments used to measure <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> the workplace were selected. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test construct validity of the new instrument. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed to explore relationships among <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work, the nursing work environment, job satisfaction, and burnout. A total of 158 RNs were included in data analysis. The newly developed instrument of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work consisted of 25 items in four sub-scales. CFA supported construct validity (CFI=. 907, RMSEA=. 080) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=. 95) of the instrument. SEM supported (1) a positive relationship between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and job satisfaction (β =. 67, SE=. 05), (2) an inverse relationship between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and burnout (β =-. 55, SE=. 06), and (3) indirect relationships of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work to job satisfaction (β =. 35, SE=. 11) and burnout (β =-. 49, SE=. 13), mediated by the nursing work environment. The results of this study supported hypothesized models, showing (1) significant direct relationships between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work, job satisfaction, and burnout, and (2) an indirect positive relationship between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and job satisfaction, mediated by the nursing work environment and an indirect inverse relationship between <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> work and burnout, mediated by the nursing work environment. <b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> work is a positive personal attribute that provides a motivational force to work, and moreover has a possible role in positively influencing nurses’ perceptions of the nursing work environment and creating healthy nursing work environments...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> {{life and}} life {{satisfaction}} are both important variables in well-being research. Whereas an appreciable {{body of work}} suggests that life satisfaction is fairly stable {{over long periods of}} time, little research has investigated the stability of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life ratings. In addition, it is unknown whether these highly correlated variables change independent of each other over time. Eighty-two participants (mean age = 19. 3 years, SD 1. 4; 76 % female; 84 % European-American) completed measures of the presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life, the search for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life, and life satisfaction an average of 13 months apart (SD = 2. 3 months). Moderate stability was found for presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life, search for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life, and life satisfaction. Multiple regressions demonstrated specificity in predicting change among these measures. Support for validity and reliability of these variables is discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life among Macedonian students can be predicted based on their dominant orientation toward past, present or future. Participants in the study were 252 students aged 18 to 27 years. Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory was used for measuring five factors of time perspective, while two dimensions of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life were measured with <b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> Life Questionnaire. The results showed that students with sentimental attitude toward past (Past Positive), with the absence of traumatic past experiences (Past Negative), hedonistic orientation (Present Hedonistic) and direction to future goals and achievements (Future), report presence of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life. On the other hand, students who search for <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life are those who have a sentimental relationship with the past and future orientation, as well as unpleasant memories of the past and the present fatalistic view determined by external factors (Present Fatalistic). Hence, significant predictors of Presence of <b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> Life appeared to be orientation toward past positive, hedonistic present and the future, as well as avoidance of the negative past reminiscences, explaining 11. 6 % of the variance. The Search for <b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> Life can be predicted from Past Positive, Past Negative and Future, thus explaining 12. 9 % of the variance. The findings confirmed the relevance of temporal perspective on the <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life in Macedonian students.

40|$|<b>Meaning</b> <b>in</b> {{life has}} long been {{recognized}} as a central dilemma of human life. In this article, we review some of the challenges of studying <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life {{from the perspective of}} social psychology. We draw on the diary of Etty Hillesum, a young woman who was killed in Auschwitz, to argue for the relevance of current empirical approaches to <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life. We review evidence suggesting that <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life is an important variable in the psychology of human functioning while also acknowledging that there is no consensus definition for the construct. Drawing on Hillesum’s diary and our research, we argue for the importance of considering <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life as the outcome of a subjective judgment process. We then review research showing the strong relationship between positive mood and <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life and suggest that such a relationship is born out in the phenom-enology of <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> life [...] mysteries don’t lose their poetry because they are solved.
