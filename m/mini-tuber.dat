40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different levels of diaminozied on the potato cultivars mini-tubers produced by tissue culture under greenhouse condition a factorial an experiment {{on the base of}} completely randomized design in three replications was performed at the Ardabil Villkige Company Greenhouse in 2010. The first factor consisted of four levels of diaminozied, as plant growth regulator, (0, 40, 80 and 120 mg. L- 1) and the second factor of five cultivars of virus-free potato (Satina, Savalan, Marfona, Agria and Cesear). Virus-free plantlets were transferred to isolated greenhouse and planted in 20 × 20 × 15 cm in plastic pots beds made by 1 : 1 volume of Biolan peat moss and perlite. During growth period traits like plant height, leaf and stem number per plant, <b>mini-tuber</b> weight and number per plant and square meter, and <b>mini-tuber</b> size were average measured. The analysis of variance showed significant differences among different levels of diaminozied for leaf number per plant, <b>mini-tuber</b> weight and its number per square meter, tuber average size in all cultivars under study. The interaction of diaminozied by cultivars showed significant difference as to leaf number per plant, <b>mini-tuber</b> weight, its number per square meter and average tuber size. Cesear and Marfona cultivars produced higher <b>mini-tuber</b> weight and tuber number per square meter by applying 40 mg. L- 1 diaminozied. The correlation was significant and positive between <b>mini-tuber</b> number per square meter with <b>mini-tuber</b> weight per square meter and root length. It was also significant and positive between <b>mini-tuber</b> weight per square meter with plant height and average <b>mini-tuber</b> size. The results of multi regression analysis indicated that <b>mini-tuber</b> weight per square meter, average tuber size, plant height and root length were effective on changes of the <b>mini-tuber</b> number. The highest positive direct effect on number of <b>mini-tuber</b> per square meter was due to the plant height and the less negative direct effect to the <b>mini-tuber</b> weight per square meter...|$|E

40|$|Compared {{to other}} major food crops, {{progress}} in potato yield {{as the result}} of breeding efforts is very slow. Genetic gains cannot be fixed in potato due to obligatory out-breeding. Overcoming inbreeding depression using diploid self-compatible clones should enable to replace the current method of out-breeding and clonal propagation into an F 1 hybrid system with true seeds. This idea is not new, but has long been considered unrealistic. Severe inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility in diploid germplasm have hitherto blocked the development of inbred lines. Back-crossing with a homozygous progenitor with the Sli gene which inhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility gave self-compatible offspring from elite material from our diploid breeding programme. We demonstrate that homozygous fixation of donor alleles is possible, with simultaneous improvement of tuber shape and tuber size grading of the recipient inbred line. These results provide proof of principle for F 1 hybrid potato breeding. The technical and economic perspectives are unprecedented as these will enable the development of new products with combinations of useful traits for all stakeholders in the potato chain.

Five contrasting environments were set-up and evaluated. A combined Analysis of Variance was performed for the variables “days to tuber set”, “days to senescence” and “plant height”. An Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) Analysis was performed for yield variables: <b>mini-tuber</b> “weight” and “number of mini-tubers” per plant. There was a high variation in all the responses to the treatments. “Days to tuber set” was influenced by genetic responses, temperature and greenhouse Photosynthetically Active Radiation intensity. Considerable increases in the length of the vegetative cycle and plant height were recorded for all genotypes, and these were particularly notable in the warmer coastal environments. AMMI analysis showed that yield variables were primarily influenced by the genotypic effect followed by the genotype by environment interaction effect. The Venturana variety (T 2) was the best performing genotype with a total average <b>mini-tuber</b> “weight” of 644 g per plant while the Chucmarina variety (T 1) performed best for the variable “number of mini-tubers” with an overall average of 60. 2 mini-tubers per plant.

40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular food crops grown as a {{substitute}} staple in Zimbabwe. Its production is constrained by pest and diseases which reduce the yield drastically. The blackleg / soft rot disease complex caused by Pectobacterium and Dickeya species (formerly known as Erwinia) has been identified as a potential threat to potato production. The soft rot pathogens can cause systemic and vascular infections in potatoes, which result in the development of various symptoms on the stem and tubers. The symptoms that develop on the plant are not species specific but depend on climatic conditions prevailing at the infection stage. The pathogens affect the crop at all stages of production, which include in the field, storage and in transit. The primary objectives of this study were to identify the pathogens which cause blackleg and soft rot on potatoes in Zimbabwe; document the grower’s knowledge of blackleg and soft rot diseases in Zimbabwe; evaluate cultivars grown in Zimbabwe and South Africa for tolerance to Pectobacterium and Dickeya species; determine the role of calcium in blackleg and soft rot development; and determine the genetic diversity of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis isolates from South Africa, Zimbabwe and <b>mini-tubers</b> imported from China. The first chapter introduces the research highlighting the importance of potatoes globally and in Zimbabwe. It discusses production constraints caused by soft rot pathogens, as well as the pathogenesis of Pectobacterium and Dickeya spp. It also summarises the research objectives and thesis outline. Chapter 2 provides an overview of published literature on morphology, pathogenicity and identification of blackleg and soft rot pathogens, epidemiology, host range, defense mechanisms in plants, host nutrition and disease management strategies. Taxonomic revisions have led to the reclassification of pectolytic Erwinia into several genera. Strains formerly described as Erwinia carotovora have been incorporated into the genus Pectobacterium, and strains classified as Erwinia chrysanthemi are now assigned to the genus Dickeya. Several species and subspecies of Pectobacterium and Dickeya have isolated from infected potatoes. In Zimbabwe only Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum have until now been identified as the causal agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases, respectively. Although other species and subspecies of Pectobacterium and Dickeya have been isolated from infected potato plants in Zimbabwe, their potential to cause diseases on potatoes should not be underestimated. In chapter 3 bacterial isolates collected from infected plants showing typical blackleg / soft rot disease symptoms were identified using biochemical and physiological methods, as well as rep-PCR, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and single gene sequencing using two genes, viz. gyrB and recA. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to study the genetic diversity among potato isolates from Zimbabwe, South Africa and <b>mini-tubers</b> imported from China. Pectobacterium and Dickeya species enter the plant through wounds and natural openings such as lenticels. When they invade the plant they colonise the vascular tissue and spaces between the thin walled parenchyma cells. They remain inside these cells as latent infections and disease symptoms develop when host resistance is impaired or when environmental conditions become conducive for disease development. Chapter 4 investigates the role of defense related enzymes, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases, chlorogenic acid and total soluble phenols in host resistance to potato soft rot. The potato varieties were assayed for activity of polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases and concentration of chlorogenic acid and total soluble phenols in tuber tissue. The role of these four components in imparting resistance against the soft rot pathogens was also investigated. Blackleg and soft rot diseases are seed-borne and difficult to control using chemical, physical and cultural methods. Several approaches aimed at controlling blackleg and tuber rot have been studied but the degree of success has been variable. Plant nutrition is an important component of natural disease resistance. The effect of calcium soil amendments in enhancing resistance to potato soft rot pathogens was investigated in Chapter 5. A management strategy based on calcium-induced defense responses of potato to Pectobacterium and Dickeya spp. was investigated. Calcium promotes production of phenolics and strengthens the cell wall, making the plants resistant to maceration by pectolytic enzymes. In Chapter 6 a survey was conducted in nine potato growing regions of Zimbabwe using an informal structured questionnaire. The findings highlighted the distribution and impact of blackleg and soft rot diseases on the Zimbabwean potato industry. A broad spectrum of information on blackleg / soft rot disease complex was gathered and this information can help growers to make informed decisions about control strategies to apply. Each chapter in this thesis has been treated as an independent entity. Thus redundancy between chapters could not be avoided. It is my hope that the results of these studies on soft rot pathogens in Zimbabwe will contribute to a better understanding of the blackleg / soft rot disease complex that they cause. I also hope that these studies will form the basis of detailed and future investigations in epidemiology and disease control strategies. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

During growth period in greenhouse, were measured the traits as plant height, main stem per plant, <b>mini-tuber</b> number, weight and average weight per plant and uniformity per plantlets. The results of combine analysis of variance showed that {{there were significant differences}} between years as mini-tubers weight per plant, mini-tubers average weight per plant, between plantlet age as mini-tubers number and weight per plant, mini-tubers average weight per plant and stem number per plant. Interaction of years and plantlet age were significant on mini-tubers weight per plant. Plantlets, which transferred to greenhouse after 20 and 30 days, showed higher mini-tubers number and weight per plant in compare with other ages. There was positive significant correlation between mini-tubers number with mini-tubers weight per plant and mini-tubers average weight per plant. After, the better plantlet age selected in greenhouse and plantlets age of 30 days cultured in 12 different planting beds prepared from Iran and Finland reigns on the basis of ten replications completely randomized blocks. Statistical analysis showed that the maximum number and average weight of <b>mini-tuber</b> per plant produced by use of three planting beds of Iran (Ardabil Neogen soil and forest peat mass with large Zeolite) and Finland (Biolan peat mass with large Zeolite) ...|$|E

Factor A included four levels of osmotic pressure (0, - 1, - 2 and - 3 bar) and factor B included seven advanced potato cultivars (Agria, Savalan (397007 - 9), Satina, Caesar, Kennebec, Marfona and Sante). The PEG 6000 was used for exerting the water deficiency stress on the plantlets. The attributes such as germinating ability and root producing was measured. In this stage the cultivar that produced the roots, had moved to the greenhouse. The plantlets were planted in soil bed with mixed of Punce and Biolan with 1 : 1 v/v. The applied experimental design was factorial on the base of completely randomized design in three replications. Factor A has four levels of osmotic pressure and factor B included seven advanced potato cultivars. After two months, was harvested the mini-tubers and the attributes was measured such as <b>mini-tuber</b> average size, mini-tubers weight and number per plant. The variance analysis results showed that significant difference between osmotic pressure levels, cultivars and their interaction as attributes mini-tubers number and weight per plant and mini-tubers average size in 1 % probability. The Caesar and Savalan cultivars had the most number and weight of <b>mini-tuber</b> per plant in - 1 bar and Caesar and Kennebec cultivars in - 2 bar osmotic pressures. The MP, GMP, STI and MSTI selected Caesar as better cultivar in normal and stress conditions. Results of cluster analysis showed that cultivars grouped in three clusters. The first cluster included Agria, Sante and Marfona (susceptible cultivars), the second cluster Satina, Savalan and Kennebec (moderately tolerance cultivars) and the third cluster Caesar (tolerance cultivar) ...|$|E

It was established that the first planting period (June 10) of test tubes and seedlings was optimal. The overall survival rate averaged 82. 0 %. The early planting period promoted an increase in the reproduction rate to 4. 8 tubers from the bush. The yield of minitubers was 326. 5 thousand pieces / ha. Sealing of landings to 142. 8 thousand pieces/ha reduced the survival rate by 5. 7 % and the multiplication factor by 0. 2 pcs. club / bush in comparison with the density of planting 71, 4 thousand pieces / ha, but significantly increased the density of standing of plants in comparison with this density by 41. 6 thousand pieces / ha (45. 6 %), with recommended (95. 2 thousand pieces / ha) — by 34. 1 thousand units / ha (37. 4 %). The number of minitubers increased to 347. 1 thousand pieces / ha.

40|$|Spongospora subterranea (Wallroth) Lagerheim f. sp. subterranea Tomlinson (Sss) is {{the causal}} {{organism}} of potato powdery scab. This blemish disease is of economic concern to fresh and seed-tuber producers around the world, as it diminishes both tuber quality and marketability. In this study, techniques for detecting and quantifying Sss were evaluated. Comparison of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), conventional PCR and real-time PCR showed that conventional PCR is {{more sensitive than}} ELISA, as conventional PCR detected Sss inoculum from both tuber and soil samples whereas ELISA only detected Sss inoculum from tuber samples. Real-time PCR not only detected Sss DNA {{in a variety of}} sample types, but real-time PCR could also be used to quantify Sss DNA. The high sensitivity of real-time PCR gave consistent detection of standard DNA quantities ranging from 10 000 to as few as 1 sporeballs per ml. The benefit of real-time PCR is that it can be used {{for the study of the}} different life stages of Sss in a range of sample types. During 2008 to 2010 powdery scab samples were collected from Ceres, KwaZulu Natal, Mpumalanga and Sandveld and herbarium samples dated 1936 from the Sandveld were also obtained to investigate genetic variation in ITS 1 / 2 sequences. Comparisons to known Sss Group Type I/II sequences were made to determine the specific Group Type/s found in South Africa. All these South African samples were identified as belonging to Sss Group Type II A bioassay was developed to investigate the dormancy period of Sss. The results showed that Sss zoospores are released four days after inoculation and infection of tomato roots occurs six days after inoculation. Plasmodia in tomato root hairs develop eight days after inoculation, followed by zoosporangia development by day 12. Several strategies are being used to minimize the risk of powdery scab as there is no single effective method for controlling the disease. One such strategy includes cultivar resistance. Cultivar susceptibility of six South African cultivars (Argos, BP 1, Buffelspoort, Caren, Up-to-Date and Valor) was evaluated. Pot trials showed that all the evaluated cultivars are susceptible to infection by Sss and that there is a positive correlation between the severity of root galls and of tuber lesions. Various crops (cabbage, mustard, soybean and tomato) were assessed to determine the host range of Sss in rotation crops in South African potato growing regions and to identify possible trap crops for Sss. Of the crops evaluated, the pathogen was unable to complete its life cycle in wheat and cabbage, whereas soybean is a non-host crop. Both mustard and tomato are hosts of Sss. A severe outbreak of powdery scab occurred during 2006 in a potato <b>mini-tuber</b> production facility in Ceres, Western Cape, South Africa. A study was conducted in the production facility to detect Sss and to identify the source/s of contamination, so that corrective measures could be taken to eradicate the pathogen. Swab samples specified areas in the production facilities that were infested with Sss sporeballs. Following eradication efforts to improve facility hygiene, a second set of swab samples was taken in 2009 to determine the efficacy of the eradication methods. From 2009 onwards, disease-free mini-tubers have been harvested. </p. This comprehensive study will lead to a better understanding of Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea and has emphasised the need for further research which will focus on strategies that will help to reduce the impact that powdery scab has on potato production, not only in South Africa, but globally too.
