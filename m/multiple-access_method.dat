40|$|Abstract — An uplink <b>multiple-access</b> <b>method</b> for a {{centralized}} ultra-wideband (UWB) radio network is studied. The <b>multiple-access</b> <b>method</b> {{is based on}} a phenomenon of multiple delay capture and is enabled by time reversal technique. Multiple delay capture is a random <b>multiple-access</b> <b>method</b> that {{can be viewed as a}} time-of-arrival (TOA) division multiple-access. When received signals are of low duty cycle, the chance of collision is low, and the base station is able to communicate with different users simultaneously. At much higher data rate compared to the narrow band scenarios, the delay spread of a UWB channel is relatively large, and the multipath-distorted signal may not be of low duty cycle. To improve the multiple-access efficiency, time reversal in conjunction with transmitter-side antenna array is considered to shorten the UWB channel impulse response (CIR). Time reversal takes advantage of rich scattering environments to achieve signal focusing, while the antenna array further enhances signal focusing. Our focus in this paper will be on evaluating the collision-free probabilities using both analysis and simulation. A lower bound is derived and it is actually a good estimate of the probability that all received signals are collision-free. Finally, quantitative results are provided, showing that the normalized system throughput increases fast as the number of users increases. Index Terms — UWB, delay capture, time reversal. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the one-stage IC scheme for Mlevel {{rectangular}} QAM can easily be extended to a multi-stage IC scheme. The performance of different single modulation systems, with equal throughput, is compared with systems employing conventional detectors and the single user bounds. In the analysis we consider two methods for handling multiple data rates, mixed modulation and parallel channels. These methods are analysed under the assumption of Rayleigh fading. The results show a considerable improvement in both performance, close to the single user bound, and capacity compared with systems employing a conventional detector. 1. Introduction In the future {{there will be a}} need for mobile telephone systems to handle all kinds of services besides speech. This will demand the systems {{to be able to handle}} multiple data rates. Other important issues for the systems are low bit error rate (BER) and high capacity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse a {{successive}} IC scheme for higher modulation in DS/CDMA systems. The performance under Rayleigh fading is analysed for single modulation systems and systems employing either {{of two different}} methods, mixed modulation or parallel channels, for handling multiple data rates. We show that the successive IC scheme for higher modulation together with mixed modulation or parallel channels give a considerable increase in performance and flexibility compared to single modulation systems employing a conventional detector. 1 Introduction In the future we will demand mobile telephone systems {{to be able to}} handle services with other requirements than speech, like e. g. facsimile, Hi-Fi audio and computer data, which is not possible today. To achieve this we need to use a <b>multiple-access</b> <b>method</b> which is flexible and has the prospect of capacity increases and being able to handle variable data rates.

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{efficient}} collusion-attack-resistant position-verification protocol {{in a new}} model named multi-channel model. In the multi-channel model, {{there are lots of}} communication channels. When a player picks a random channel and sends a short message over it, the message might slip by an adversary with high probability if the adversary does not know the channel beforehand. This idea is motivated by the <b>multiple-access</b> <b>methods.</b> We adopt it to solve the position-verification task. Adding different constraints into the multi-channel model, we make three sub-models: receivingconstrained multi-channel model, sending-constrained multi-channel model and both-constrained multichannel model. Our position-verification protocol is secure under all of these sub-models with appropriate parameters...|$|R
40|$|In this letter, {{we compare}} the {{complexity}} and efficiency of several methods used for multiuser detection in a synchronous code-division <b>multiple-access</b> system. Various <b>methods</b> are discussed, including decision-feedback (DF) detection, group decision-feedback (GDF) detection, coordinate descent, quadratic programming with constraints, space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) detection, Tabu search, a Boltzmann machine detector, semidefinite relaxation, probabilistic data association (PDA), branch and bound (BBD), and the sphere decoding (SD) method. The efficiencies of the algorithms, defined as the probability of group detection error divided {{by the number of}} floating point computations, are compared under various situations. Of particular interest is the appearance of an “efficient frontier ” of algorithms, primarily composed of DF detector, GDF detector, PDA detector, the BBD optimal algorithm, and the SD method. The efficient frontier is the convex hull of algorithms as plotted on probability of error versus computational demands axes: algorithms not on this efficient frontier can be considered dominated by those that are...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{cooperative}} {{spectrum sensing}} (CSS) schemes in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) {{require that the}} secondary users (SUs) report their sensing data separately in the time domain to the fusion center, which yields long reporting delay {{especially in the case}} of large number of cooperative SUs. By exploiting the computation over <b>multiple-access</b> channel (CoMAC) <b>method,</b> this paper proposes a novel CoMAC-based CSS scheme that allows the cooperative SUs to encode their local statistics in transmit power and to transmit simultaneously the modulated symbols sequence carrying transmit power information to the fusion center. The fusion center then makes the final decision on the presence of primary users by recovering the overall test statistic of energy detection from the energy of the received signal. Performance metrics of the CoMAC-based CSS scheme, i. e., detection probability and false alarm probability, are further derived based on the central limit theorem. Finally, based on the derived detection and false alarm probabilities, both energy detection threshold and spectrum sensing time are optimized to improve the average throughput of the CRN. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of this work...|$|R
30|$|Wireless {{communication}} of multiple correlated information sources {{to a common}} receiver has become an important research problem due to potential applications in emerging information gathering systems such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs)[1]. Most of the recent work on this problem {{has been focused on}} approaches based on the separation of source and channel coding, which rely on using distributed source coding (DSC)[2] to first generate independent bit streams from two sources and then to use a <b>multiple-access</b> <b>method</b> (such as TDMA, FDMA, or CDMA)[3] to convert a multiple-access channel (MAC) into a set of orthogonal channels. While it is known that for {{communication of}} correlated sources over orthogonal channels, the source-channel separation is optimal[3 – 5], the same does not hold true for a MAC[6 – 8]. Hence, there can be a loss of performance when separate source and channel coding is used to transmit correlated sources over a MAC. This is because when the sources are correlated, even if the transmitters cannot communicate with each other, it is possible to generate correlated inputs to a MAC by using a DJSC code and thereby improve the performance relative to a system with independent channel inputs. In contrast, with separate source and channel coding, distributed source coding of correlated sources yields independent bit streams, and hence, the MAC inputs cannot be made dependent unless the transmitters are allowed to collaborate in channel coding. Therefore, DJSC coding can be expected to outperform separate source and channel coding in systems such as WSNs which are equipped with low-complexity, narrow-band sensors designed to communicate only with a common information gathering receiver.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Trellis-code multiple-access (TCMA) is a {{narrowband}} multiple-access scheme {{based on}} trellis-coded modulation. There is no bandwidth expansion, so users occupy the same bandwidth as one single user. The load of the system, in number of bits per channel use, is therefore {{much higher than the}} load in, for example, conventional code-division multiple-access systems. Interleavers are introduced as a new feature to separate the users. This implies that the maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) is now too complex to implement. Iterative detectors are therefore suggested {{as an alternative to the}} joint MLSD. The conventional interference cancellation (IC) detector has lower complexity than the MLSD, but its performance is shown to be far from acceptable. Even after a novel improvement of the IC detector, the performance is unsatisfactory. Instead of using IC, another iterative detector is suggested. This detector updates the branch metric for every iteration, and avoids the standard Gaussian approximation. Simulations show that the performance of this detector can be close to single-user performance, even when the interleaver and the phase offset are the only user-specific features in the TCMA system.

30|$|An {{extensive}} survey {{presented in}} [18] reviews the state-of-the-art and advances in cognitive-radio {{medium access control}} protocols. A stochastic geometry framework that captures the performance of an asynchronous ALOHA network in which a subset of nodes operates in full-duplex mode is presented in [19]. Compared to [20] and [21], in which an altruistic player can regain access to shared spectrum in an asynchronous ALOHA network, [19] only allows licensed primary users to access the network. In order to evaluate our game theory modeling approach, we used a queuing analysis that is used in [22]. The opportunistic access used for the performance analysis in [22] does not consider different cost functions or pricing schemes, number of primary or secondary cognitive users, or congestion. An M/G/ 1 queuing system (a queue model in which arrivals are Markovian and service times have a general distribution with a single server) containing one primary and multiple secondary users is presented in [23]. Here, we use an M/D/ 1 queuing system, merely {{to be used for}} analysis. Secondary users can gain access to the spectrum through an amplify-and-forward time-division <b>multiple-access</b> protocol. Our <b>method</b> is more generalized in that it supports multiple primary users as well as general cost functions that are not imposing any performance requirement for secondary users such as amplify and forward.|$|R
