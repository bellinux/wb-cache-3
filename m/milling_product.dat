40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the maximal amount of concentrate and forage that could be replaced with a new wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product.</b> The corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> contained 23. 1 % crude protein, 9. 9 % ruminally undegradable protein, 13. 7 % acid detergent fiber, 40. 3 % neutral detergent fiber, and 2. 6 % ether extract (% of dry matter; DM). In experiment 1, 16 Holstein cows were {{assigned to one of}} four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The four diets contained 54. 3 % forage (alfalfa:corn silages, 1 : 1 DM basis) with the wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> replacing 0, 50, 75, or 100 % of the concentrate portion (corn and soybean meal) of the diet (DM basis). The diets containing wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> resulted in 7. 8 % lower DM intake, equivalent milk production (28. 5 kg/ d), and 13. 6 % greater efficiency of 4 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) production than the control diet. There was no effect of diet on ruminal pH. In experiment 2, 16 Holstein cows were assigned to one of four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The 100 % concentrate replacement diet from experiment 1 was used as control diet. For the test diets, forage was replaced with 15, 30, or 45 % of the corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (DM basis). Efficiency of FCM production (1. 16) was not affected by diet. Rumination time was reduced for the 30 and 45 % forage replacement diets, but ruminal pH was unaffected. In experiment 3, 30 Holstein cows were assigned at parturition to either a control diet (no corn <b>milling</b> <b>product)</b> or a diet containing 40 % corn milling feed in place of both forage and concentrate (optimal levels from experiments 1 and 2) for 9 wk. The diet containing corn milling feed resulted in 21 % greater efficiency of FCM production than the control diet. These results indicate that a new feed product based on wet corn milling ingredients has the potential to effectively replace all of the concentrate and up to 45 % of the forage in the diet for lactating dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield of}} {{products}} in the dry milling industry is largely determined by the physical properties of the corn kernel. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate several statistical models of dry milling yield prediction based on physical characteristics of corn. Data consisting of one hundred corn samples representing a range of genetic traits and quality differences are used. For each corn sample, 16 physical and chemical properties plus six dry <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> yields were measured in a controlled laboratory environment. For each corn sample, we consider a vector of dry <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> yields and a vector of physical corn characteristics. Several single product models are investigated, two of which implicitly take into account the simplex sample space of product yields. A multivariate model is considered that consists of mapping the sample space from a simplex to unrestricted Euclidean space. Comparison are performed using a jack-knife-like approach.

40|$|Two {{forms of}} nonenzymatically browned {{sunflower}} seeds were evaluated in two lactating dairy cow trials {{to determine their}} effect on animal performance and ruminal fermentation. In the first experiment, eight lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square with 3 -wk periods. Four treatments were used: (1) control diet with no added lipid, (2) sunflower oil (SFO), (3) untreated, ground sunflower seeds (GSF), and (4) nonenzymatically browned, ground sunflower seed (NEBS). ^ In the second trial, thirty cows were {{assigned to one of}} three diets for a period of 6 wk. Diets were fed as total mixed rations that contained 40 % of a 1 : 1 mixture of alfalfa and corn silage and (1) wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (CMP) with no added lipid, (2) CMP + nonenzymatically browned sunflowers (NEBS), and (3) CMP + tallow. Our objective was to investigate the effect of supplementing a diet containing high amounts of wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> with RUP and RUL from nonenzymatically browned sunflowers on efficiency of fat-corrected milk production and composition of milk fatty acids. ^ The results of these studies indicate that the oil in NEBS was partially protected from ruminal biohydrogenation and successfully elevated the desirable poly- and monounsaturated fatty acid content of milk fat, reduced saturated fatty acids, and increased CLA content in milk fat. The experiments also demonstrated that NEBS accomplish the positive alterations in milk fatty acid composition without reducing the output of milk fat. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

The amorphization and {{crystallization}} {{of mechanical}} alloyed Cu 50 Zr 40 Ag 10 alloy {{have been investigated}} using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results demonstrate that a full amorphous phase of Cu 50 Zr 40 Ag 10 can be obtained through mechanical alloying. The amorphous phase begins to show the initial mechanical crystallization when the milling time is 108 h and subsequently the main <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> is still amorphous structure with increasing milling time up to 208 h. Therefore, the amorphous alloy exhibits the excellent mechanical stability during mechanical alloying.

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> is {{determined}} by size distribution and contaminations, resulting from particle-bead contact (mass and size of bead abrasion) and particle - wall contact. Increase of energy in bead mills will decrease the milling time but increase the bead attrition. This interaction was investigated by comminution of an aqueous alumina suspension (d 90 = 4. 5 µm) in a laboratory attrition mill (AHM 90, Hosokawa Alpine AG) under different conditions. Based on preliminary tests with zirconia beads (0. 2 / 0. 5 / 1 mm) the technological parameter range for an experimental plan (DoE) was selected: - volume flux (0. 75 - 1. 5 l/min) - volume ratio of bead (60 - 80 vol%) - rotation speed of milling discs (1600 - 3000 rpm). The results indicate the large influence of bead diameter on milling kinetics and on bead abrasion. With constant specific energy input of about 0. 75 kWh/kg particle sizes of about d 90 = 2. 6 µm were realized.

40|$|At Domfer Metal Powders, {{the ball}} milling {{operation}} is critical since it determines many {{characteristics of the}} final product, such as density, green strength, compressibility and dimensional change. Highly variable input material properties and operational procedures accompanied by poor product feedback frequency generate large variations in powder properties. The goal of the research {{is to develop a}} model-based control system for the ball milling process of metal powder. The following research objectives are aimed at reducing process variations while maximizing throughput: include ball mill physics into design and computer models, develop control strategies and computer architectures for real-time control, and develop process monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques. Ball mill size reduction theory is presented as a basis for process characterization. Next, process physics are described along with the measurability and controllability of the variables. Then, plant trials are performed to define system behavior and performance specifications of variables and sensors. After that, a sampler for metal powder is developed to automate the entire sieve analysis process. A new ball mill model is created for open-circuit dry ball milling of metal powders. The process model is a combination of rules, equations and heuristics and is implemented using an agent based architecture that can deal with multiple data streams and a network of related sub-models of different sizes and operating time scales. The model architecture is integrated using a programmable logic controller. Control and monitoring algorithms are developed in low-level PC language. A performance plant trial validated the control system and demonstrated that ball <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> specifications, namely size distribution and apparent density, are achievable and maintainable at a 99. 7 % confidence interval.
