In the book, they write, “Lengthy {{struggle}} without success {{is a sign}} that what we’re doing isn’t working. It’s time to do something else, anything else.

[...] The following year, he attended the NLP Conference and Festival at the University of Bristol, England. There Faulkner presented [...] "Awakening to the Social – An Introduction to Irresistible Influence." [...] The following year he presented [...] "Expository Cartography," [...] an introduction to advanced <b>mind</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques {{that could be used to}} disengage habitual biases and systematically enrich any model including the more complex ones such as the four-quadrant model of Ken Wilber. In 2006 at the NLP Conference in London, he presented [...] "Training is for Dogs and Horses", a bold challenge to the limiting approach in which NLP had previously been taught. In September 2007 Faulkner lectured at the London School of Economics to The Society for Organisational Learning(SOL-UK).|$|E

[...] The company has made no clear statement if the mind-mapping interface will be supported going forward but has stated clearly that their business model is focused on collaboration of web contact and it was felt that the new interface made Pearltrees more accessible to a wider base of users who may have been previously turned off by the added complexity of <b>mind</b> <b>mapping</b> their content.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mind</b> <b>map</b> is a {{graphical}} technique, {{which is}} used to represent words, concepts, tasks or other connected items or arranged around central topic or idea. <b>Mind</b> <b>maps</b> are widely used, therefore exist plenty of software programs to create or edit them, while there is none format for the model representation, neither a standard format. This paper presents and effort to propose a formal <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> model aiming to describe the structure, content, semantics and social connections. The structure describes the basic <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> graph consisted of a node set, an edge set, a cloud set and a graphical connections set. The content includes the set of the texts and objects linked to the nodes. The social connections are the <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> of other users, which form the neighborhood of the <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> owner in a social networking system. Finally, the <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> semantics is any true logic connection between <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> textual parts and a concept.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into primary-aged children's ability {{to learn how to}} construct <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> and use these as a tool to support thinking and planning for written tasks. Little research has investigated the kinds of <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> produced by 7 - 11 year old children, or the impact on an associated written task. It is argued therefore that a closer examination of these claims might shed light on how children learn and use such representations. An initial exploratory study investigated the ability of children to create <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> and use them as planning tools for narrative writing. Following this, five experimental studies were conducted exploring how to enhance children's construction and use of <b>mind</b> <b>maps.</b> Two studies were concerned with supporting the construction process independent of a written task and three further studies investigated <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> plans linked to expository writing tasks. Strategies that improved children's <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> construction were found to be the use of templates, a staged inductive procedure or collaboration using computer software. No overall improvement in children's writing was found when <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> were used as planning tools, but better structured <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> were correlated with better written texts. A close examination of items present on <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> plans and included in written tasks revealed that there was more transfer of items from <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> to texts of better quality. Findings suggest that children can learn and engage with this kind of representation successfully, however the task environment is particularly influential on the types of <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> produced. It is suggested that representations such as <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> can be usefully introduced into the primary curriculum as an effective planning tool. <b>Mind</b> <b>maps</b> also create a visible record of planning that can provide an opportunity for focused teacher intervention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we use a}} graph {{analysis}} tool {{to measure}} how student-created <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> reflect learning. <b>Mind</b> <b>maps</b> consist of words and connections between words, and this visual tool helps illustrate how an individual understands how these words connect together in a field. From an analysis standpoint, <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> are graphs consisting of nodes connected by edges. In the fall of 2011, students created three <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> over the duration of a digital system design course, and {{at each of the}} three intervals, these <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> were created with the same 20 terms that were introduced throughout the course. Each student’s <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> were then digitally encoded and analyzed using a modern graph analysis tool called GraphCrunch II. Our results show that a simple analysis of graph density is a poor indicator of learning since this metric does not capture a graph’s structure, and it is this structure that reflects meaning and understanding by the learner. Instead, a metric called relative graphlet frequency distance (RGF-distance), which is calculated by comparing a golden <b>mind</b> <b>map</b> (expert created <b>mind</b> <b>map)</b> to each of the students <b>mind</b> <b>maps,</b> is used to analyze each students understanding of how these words relate. Our results show that learner’s <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> decrease in RGF-distance over the period of the course, and this means that the students are building graphs more {{similar to that of the}} golden model. We, also, see that the RGF-distance over the set of students compared to their grades on an exam or overall grade in the course has some correlation, meaning that these <b>mind</b> <b>maps</b> relate to grades in terms of the learners understanding of vocabulary, but the correlation is not strong. The ultimate goal of these tools is to provide the learners with a method of getting automatic feedback on their understanding as well as learning progress in particular topics. I...|$|R
