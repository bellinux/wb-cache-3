50|$|A {{mortise lock}} (<b>mortice</b> <b>lock</b> in British English) is a lock that {{requires}} a pocket—the mortise—to be cut into the door or piece of furniture into which the lock is to be fitted. In {{most parts of the}} world, mortise locks are found on older buildings constructed before the advent of bored cylindrical locks, but they have recently become more common in commercial and upmarket residential construction in the United States. They are widely used in domestic properties of all ages in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|A 5 {{lever lock}} is often {{required}} for home insurance and often {{recommended by the}} police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Valerie Olifent notes that [...] "The doors of many historic churches still carry an old wooden lock although often you find that a modern 5-lever <b>mortice</b> <b>lock</b> has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements." [...] BS3621:2007 requires a bolt throw of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} standards for <b>mortice</b> <b>locks</b> in use. The most common are: ...|$|R
50|$|When {{originally}} {{built the}} estate was also famous for having only three patterns of key amongst {{the hundreds of}} front doors. If locked out, one simply borrowed one's neighbour's key. There were no <b>mortice</b> <b>locks</b> fitted as standard and children returning home were able to put their arms through the side mounted letter boxes and release the latches.|$|R
50|$|The Lever Privacy {{is similar}} to the Lever Bathroom in that it is locked by turning a snib on the inside and can be {{unlocked}} from the outside in emergencies. Unlike the Level Bathroom, there is no <b>mortice</b> sash; the <b>locking</b> is achieved by jamming the lever in a closed position.|$|R
50|$|The Lever lock {{door handle}} on a {{backplate}} is {{another type of}} door handle which operates similarly to the lever latch door handle. This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a <b>mortice</b> sash <b>lock.</b> Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of door handle is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R
50|$|A torc, also spelled torq or torque, {{is a large}} rigid or stiff {{neck ring}} in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together. The great {{majority}} are open at the front, although some had hook and ring closures and a few had <b>mortice</b> and tenon <b>locking</b> catches to close them. Many seem designed for near-permanent wear {{and would have been}} difficult to remove. Torcs are found in the Scythian, Illyrian Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the European Iron Age from around the 8th century BC to the 3rd century AD. For the Iron Age Celts the gold torc {{seems to have been a}} key object, identifying the wearer as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient Celtic art are torcs. The Celtic torc disappears in the Migration Period, but during the Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces, now mainly in silver, came back into fashion. Torc styles of neck-ring are found as part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods.|$|R
