5|$|Show Boat {{was adapted}} for live radio {{at least seven}} times. Due to network {{censorship}} rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the <b>miscegenation</b> aspect of the plot. Notable exceptions were the 1940 Cavalcade of America broadcast and the 1952 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or <b>miscegenation</b> could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, anti-miscegenation laws (also {{known as}} <b>miscegenation</b> laws) were state laws passed by {{individual}} states to prohibit <b>miscegenation,</b> nowadays more {{commonly referred to}} as interracial marriage and interracial sex.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{defining}} <b>miscegenation</b> as a felony, {{these laws}} prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons {{of different races}} and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes, the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of <b>miscegenation</b> itself, but felony charges of adultery or fornication would be brought against them instead.|$|E

25|$|Laws and {{policies}} which discouraged <b>miscegenation</b> were issued in various dynasties, including an 836 AD decree forbidding Chinese to have {{relations with other}} peoples such as Iranians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Cohabitation was {{the most}} common crime in Minas Gerais. The Catholic Church was strict in the {{punishment}} of this crime, in order to prevent the widespread <b>miscegenation</b> between White, mostly Portuguese males with Black or Mulatto women.|$|E
25|$|Salvador's {{population}} {{is the result}} of 500 years of <b>miscegenation.</b> The majority of the population has African, European and Native American roots. The African ancestry of the city is from Angola, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, {{he became}} the first U.S. Senator to offer a Civil Service Reform bill to Congress. During Reconstruction, Schurz was opposed to federal {{military}} enforcement and protection of African American civil rights, and held nineteenth century ideas of European superiority and fears of <b>miscegenation.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the colonies}} and {{southern}} states protected white fathers by making all {{children born to}} slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned <b>miscegenation</b> or interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.|$|E
25|$|The Lovings {{were charged}} under Section 20-58 of the Virginia Code, which {{prohibited}} interracial couples from being married {{out of state}} and then returning to Virginia, and Section 20-59, which classified <b>miscegenation</b> as a felony, punishable by a prison sentence of between one and five years.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a {{small country}} Guinea-Bissau has several ethnic groups which are very {{distinct}} from each other, with their own cultures and languages. This is due that Guinea-Bissau was a refugee territory due to migrations within Africa. Colonization and <b>miscegenation</b> brought Portuguese and the Portuguese creole, the Kriol or crioulo.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the arrival}} of the Portuguese in 1500, {{considerable}} <b>miscegenation</b> between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with European ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% to 77%).|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1949, however, {{only fifteen}} states had no {{segregation}} laws in effect. and only eighteen states had outlawed segregation in public accommodations. Of the remaining states, twenty still allowed school segregation to take place, fourteen still allowed segregation to remain in public transportation and 30 still enforced laws forbidding <b>miscegenation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of naming Afro-Brazilians with religious surnames was proved even by some indirect approaches. Medical researchers demonstrated {{that there is}} a statistical correlation between a religious name and genetic diseases related to African ancestry such as the sickle-cell disease. Due to <b>miscegenation,</b> the correlation exists even among white people that have religious surnames.|$|E
25|$|The {{study also}} found, via {{autosomal}} analysis, {{that the majority}} of post-Neolithic populations in Europe, including their ancient samples taken from Beaker culture sites in central Europe, are the result of a three-way <b>miscegenation</b> process between the Yamnaya; Neolithic farmers; and western European hunter gatherers who were present in Europe since at least the Mesolithic.|$|E
25|$|Documentary evidence, such as {{newspaper}} articles and reports to parliamentary committees, suggest {{a range of}} rationales. Apparent motivations included {{the belief that the}} Aboriginal people would die out, given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, the belief that they were heathens and were better off in non-indigenous households, and the belief that full-blooded Aboriginal people resented <b>miscegenation</b> and the mixed-race children fathered and abandoned by white men.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Richard and Mildred Loving {{challenged}} <b>miscegenation</b> laws in {{the state}} when they married. Although they married in Washington, DC, they returned to live in Caroline County, where they were arrested and charged under the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. Their case went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in 1967 found anti-miscegenation statutes to be unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Woodhull's {{campaign}} was also notable {{for the nomination}} of Frederick Douglass, {{although he did not}} take part in it. His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of whites and blacks in public life and fears of <b>miscegenation.</b> The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African-American civil rights activists, as the exclusion of female suffrage from the Fifteenth Amendment two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups.|$|E
25|$|The stereotypical {{views about}} blacks {{imparted}} to s Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, {{and they tried}} to educate him on African American culture. They were also offended by the fact that biracial roommate Malik Cooper wore a T-shirt with the image of Marcus Garvey, who was against <b>miscegenation,</b> despite the fact that Cooper was of mixed heritage and by his own admission had never dated a black woman.|$|E
25|$|The year 1492 also {{marked the}} arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, {{beginning}} the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although Columbus remained convinced that he had reached the Orient. The colonisation of the Americas started, with conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro. <b>Miscegenation</b> was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people.|$|E
25|$|Hayakawa was in {{a unique}} {{position}} due to his ethnicity and fame in the English-speaking world. Due to naturalization laws of that time, Hayakawa would be unable to become a U.S. citizen and because of anti-miscegenation laws he could not marry someone of another race. In 1930, the Production Code came into effect which forbade portrayals of <b>miscegenation</b> in film. This meant that unless Hayakawa's co-star was an Asian actress, {{he would not be able}} to portray a romance with her.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{acceptance}} of <b>miscegenation,</b> Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were racially mixed, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.|$|E
25|$|During the Portuguese {{colonization}} of the Americas, Cabral made landfall off the atlantic coast. Over the following decade the indigenous Tupí, Tapuya and other tribes which lived {{along the coast}} suffered large depopulation due to disease and violence. A process of <b>miscegenation</b> between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women also occurred. It is estimated that of the 2.5 million indigenous peoples {{who had lived in}} the region which now comprises Brazil, less than 10 per cent survived to the 1600s. The primarily reason for depopulation was diseases such as smallpox that advanced far beyond movement of European settlers.|$|E
25|$|The blood atonement {{doctrine}} was {{the impetus}} behind {{laws in the}} territory and state of Utah allowing capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation. Though people in Utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes {{under the assumption that}} this would aid their salvation, there is no clear evidence that Young or other top theocratic Mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy or non-capital crimes like <b>miscegenation.</b> There is, however, some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular judicial procedure. The rhetoric of blood atonement may have contributed to a culture of violence leading to the Mountain Meadows massacre.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century Iowa {{was among}} the {{earliest}} states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the very first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court – In Re the Matter of Ralph, decided July 1839 – the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years {{before the end of}} the Civil War. The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban <b>miscegenation</b> statutes nationwide.|$|E
25|$|Anti-miscegenation {{laws were}} a part of American law in some States since before the United States was {{established}} and remained so until ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia. The term <b>miscegenation</b> was first used in 1863, during the American Civil War, by American journalists to discredit the abolitionist movement by stirring up debate over the prospect of interracial marriage after the abolition of slavery. In those of the original Thirteen Colonies that became states and enacted such laws, they were enacted as state law in the early 18th century; a century or more after the complete racialization of slavery.|$|E
25|$|In 1898 Alex Manly of Wilmington, North Carolina, {{directly}} challenged popular {{ideas about}} lynching {{in an editorial}} in his newspaper The Daily Record, {{believed to be the}} only black-owned newspaper in the nation. He noted that consensual relationships took place between white women and black men, and said that many of the latter had white fathers (as he did). His references to <b>miscegenation</b> lifted the veil of denial. Whites were outraged. A mob destroyed his printing press and business, ran black leaders out of town and killed many others, and overturned the biracial Populist-Republican city government, headed by a white mayor and majority-white council. Manly escaped, eventually settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{frustrated}} by {{their inability to}} travel together to visit their families in Virginia, {{as well as their}} social isolation and financial difficulties in Washington, Mildred Loving wrote in protest to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU assigned volunteer cooperating attorneys Bernard S. Cohen and Philip J. Hirschkop, who filed a motion on behalf of the Lovings in the Virginia Caroline County Circuit Court, that requested the court to vacate the criminal judgments and set aside the Lovings' sentences {{on the grounds that the}} Virginia <b>miscegenation</b> statutes ran counter to the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, 17 Southern states (all {{the former}} slave states plus Oklahoma) still {{enforced}} laws prohibiting marriage between whites and non-whites. Maryland repealed its law {{in response to}} the start of the proceedings at the Supreme Court. After the ruling of the Supreme Court, the remaining laws were no longer enforceable. Nonetheless, it took South Carolina until 1998 and Alabama until 2000 to amend their states' constitutions to remove language prohibiting <b>miscegenation.</b> In the respective referendums, 62% of voters in South Carolina and 59% of voters in Alabama voted to make the amendments. In Alabama nearly 526,000 people voted against the amendment, including a majority of voters in some rural counties.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of people in Argentina and Uruguay are largely of European descent; not only of Spanish Europeans, but Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Irish, etc. In countries like Mexico, Chile, or Puerto Rico, there was a process of <b>miscegenation,</b> which resulted in many people having both indigenous and European origins. Many white Mexicans, though labeled Hispanic by the U.S. definition because of their assimilated culture and country of birth, trace their ancestries to European countries other than Spain, and some to non-European countries (see next paragraph). Nevertheless, in most cases, they have some Spanish ancestry, as the waves of European immigrants to these countries tended to quickly assimilate, intermarrying with the country's local population.|$|E
25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{says that}} the name of Simeon refers to Leah's belief that God had heard that Jacob {{preferred}} her sister, Rachel, implying a derivation from the Hebrew term shama on, meaning he has heard of my suffering; this is a similar etymology as the Torah gives for the theophoric name Ishmael (God has heard), implying that the names are cognate. The name is sometimes interpreted as meaning he who listens {{to the words of}} God, and at other times thought to derive from sham 'in, meaning there is sin, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri's sexual <b>miscegenation</b> with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful.|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 1965, a three-judge {{district}} court panel postponed {{decision on the}} federal class-action case while the Lovings appealed Judge Bazile's decision on constitutional grounds to the Virginia Supreme Court. Justice Harry L. Carrico (later Chief Justice of the Court) wrote an opinion for the court upholding {{the constitutionality of the}} anti-miscegenation statutes. While he upheld their criminal convictions, he directed that their sentence be modified. Carrico cited as authority the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Naim v. Naim (1955) and argued that the Lovings' case was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because both the white and the non-white spouse were punished equally for the crime of <b>miscegenation,</b> an argument similar to that made by the United States Supreme Court in 1883 in Pace v. Alabama.|$|E
