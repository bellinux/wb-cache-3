40|$|This study {{investigated}} the anti-Candida activity of methanol extracts from freeze-dried probiotic cells and the isolation of some constituents in the extracts. The MIC values of the probiotic <b>methanol</b> <b>cell</b> extracts against Candida albicans ranged between 1. 25 and 5 mg/ml after 48 h of incubation. However, Lactococcus latics subsp. lactis strain X and Lactobacillus casei strain B extracts had an MIC of 10 mg/ml after 48 h of incubation. The extracts had fungistatic rather than fungicidal activity. These extracts had a much higher antifungal activity than antifungal compounds isolated from the growth medium by many other authors. This indicates that probiotics may also release antifungal compounds in their cells that could contribute to a therapeutic effect. Lactic acid (1) and 6 -O-(α-D-glucopyranosyl) - 1, 6 -di-O-pentadecanoyl-α-D-glucopyranose a novel fatty acid derivative (2) were isolated from methanol probiotic extracts {{and the structure of}} these compounds were elucidated using NMR (1 and 2 D) and mass spectrometry (MS).

40|$|Individual {{addition}} of a commercially available nutritional supplement and a methanol extract from an industrial Saccharomyces sp. strain SMC resulted in the enhanced growth of Saccharomyces sp. strain SMC in minimal medium. Isolation of the growth enhancing components from aqueous extracts of the supplement and the cellular extract was performed using reversed-phase, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. Reversed-phase chromatography using Sep-Pak® vac C 18 yielded aqueous washes which elicited increased yeast growth. Gel filtration chromatography of the aqueous washes in a group separation mode using Sephadex G 25 gave three distinct groups for the nutritional supplement, and four distinct groups for the cellular extract. Fraction groups that exhibited growth enhancing activity also exhibited high absorbances at all three wavelengths of 214, 260, and 280 nm. Two major fractions which tested positive for growth enhancing activity in succeeding experiments were obtained after passing each of the active GFC groups through a Toyopearl SP 550 C cation exchanger column. The active component from the cellular extract did not bind to the cation exchanger. The absorbance data at 214 nm (peptide bond experimental absorbance maximum wavelength), the Bradford assay (showing the presence of proteinaceous matter), and the active component’s inclusion in the Sephadex G 25 fractionation range of 1 - 5 kDa (characteristic of small peptides) suggest that the growth enhancing components of the nutritional supplement and <b>methanol</b> <b>cell</b> extracts are peptides...|$|E

Notably, 14 CH 4 and [3 - 14 C]alanine synthesized from 14 CH 3 OH during growth shared a common specific activity distinct from that of CO 2 or <b>methanol.</b> <b>Cell</b> suspensions synthesized acetate and alanine from 14 CO 2. The addition of iodopropane inhibited acetate synthesis but did not decrease the amount of 14 CH 3 OH or 14 CO 2 fixed into one-carbon carriers (i. e., methyl coenzyme M or carboxydihydromethanopterin). Carboxydihydromethanopterin was only labeled from 14 CH 3 OH {{in the absence of}} hydrogen. Cell extracts catalyzed the synthesis of acetate from 14 CO (∼ 1 nmol/min per mg of protein) and an isotopic exchange between CO 2 or CO and the C- 1 of pyruvate. Acetate synthesis from 14 CO was stimulated by methyl B 12 but not by methyl tetrahydrofolate or methyl coenzyme M. Methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme M were inhibitory to acetate synthesis. Cell extracts contained high levels of phosphotransacetylase (> 6 μmol/min per mg of protein) and acetate kinase (> 0. 14 μmol/min per mg of protein).

40|$|We {{examined}} the unitrophic metabolism of acetate and methanol individually and the mixotrophic utilization of these compounds by using detailed 14 C-labeled tracer studies in {{a strain of}} Methanosarcina barkeri adapted to grow on acetate as the sole carbon and energy source. The substrate consumption rate and methane production rate were significantly lower on acetate alone than during the unitrophic or mixotrophic metabolism of <b>methanol.</b> <b>Cell</b> yields (in grams per mole of substrate) were identical during exponential growth on acetate and exponential growth on methanol. During unitrophic metabolism of acetate, the methyl moiety accounted {{for the majority of}} the CH 4 produced, but 14 % of the CO 2 generated originated from the methyl moiety. This correlated with the concurrent reduction of equivalent amounts of the C- 1 of acetate to CH 4. 14 CH 4 was also produced from added 14 CO 2, although to a lesser extent than from reduction of the C- 1 of acetate. During mixotrophic metabolism, methanol and acetate were catabolized simultaneously. The rates of 14 CH 4 and 14 CO 2 generation from [2 - 14 C]acetate were logarithmic and higher in mixotrophic than in unitrophic cultures at substrate concentrations of 50 mM. A comparison of the oxidoreductase activities in cell extracts of the acetate-adapted strain grown on acetate and of strain MS grown on methanol or on H 2 plus CO 2 indicated that the pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities remained constant, whereas the CO dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher (5, 000 nmol/min per mg of protein) in the acetate-adapted strain. These results suggested that a significant intramolecular redox pathway is possible for the generation of CH 4 from acetate, that energy metabolism from acetate by M. barkeri is not catabolite repressed by methanol, and that the acetate-adapted strain is a metabolic mutant with derepressed CO dehydrogenase activity...|$|E
40|$|Periodontitis is {{a dental}} disease which {{can result in}} a loss of {{integrity}} of the periodontal tissues and lead to eventual tooth loss. Barrier membranes can be used in conjunction with guided bone regeneration (GBR) to help repair the damage caused by periodontitis. GBR promotes and directs the growth of new bone, whilst the barrier membrane secludes the defect site from infiltration by fast growing connective and epithelial tissues which would otherwise fill the defect space. The ideal properties for a barrier membrane are: to have a controllable degradation rate, be biocompatible, prevent surrounding tissues from collapsing into the defect space, and provide cell occlusivity. Current commercial barrier membranes are produced out of materials which are either non-resorbable, requiring a secondary surgery for their extraction, or made from resorbable materials which can have poor structural integrity or degrade into acidic by-products. Silk has had a long history of use as a biomaterial. It degrades into non-toxic components and has adaptable mechanical properties. When used in its regenerated silk fibroin form (RFS), it has recently been used for tissue engineering scaffolds. RSF has several polymorphs of which silk I and silk II are of interest. Silk I is non-crystalline and water soluble while silk II has a crystalline β-sheet structure that is non-water soluble. Silk I converts to silk II upon exposure to methanol, heat treatments and stretching. The ability to transform RSF from a water soluble structure into a non-water soluble structure makes it ideal for a variety of processing techniques. In this thesis, reactive inkjet printing has been investigated as a possible processing method of RSF for the manufacture of barrier membranes. Reactive inkjet printing has been used to control the structural conversion of silk I to silk II by printing different volumes of methanol during film fabrication. It was established that RSF crystallinity (and silk II content) was dependant on the volume of methanol printed. RSF film degradation rate was shown to be related to RSF crystallinity, and hence the volume of printed <b>methanol.</b> <b>Cell</b> studies performed on the RSF films showed that MG- 63 osteosarcoma cells remained metabolically active and continued to proliferate during the duration of the study, as well as showing signs of osteogenic activity. RSF films were investigated with the inclusion of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) to promote osteogenic activity. nHA/RSF films were produced from a composite ink containing both nHA and RSF. It was found that the inclusion of nHA within the ink impeded the transition of silk I to silk II, and instead increased β-turn structural content, which is an intermediate structure in the transition of silk I to silk II. The inclusion of nHA within the RSF films was shown to improve the osteogenic response of the MG- 63 cells. Overall, the work presented in this thesis has demonstrated {{for the first time that}} reactive inkjet printing can produce biocompatible RSF films with controllable crystallinity and degradation rate. As a result, a controllable degradation rate, the possibility of including bioactive components such as nHA, in addition to the other promising properties of RSF, make reactively inkjet printed RSF as a viable alternative for use as a barrier membrane. ...|$|E
