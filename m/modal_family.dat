The most {{familiar}} logics in the <b>modal</b> <b>family</b> are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke for his contributions to modal logic. Kripke introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to intuitionistic logic and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent prior to Kripke.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{incorporates}} a fracture mechanics approach to characterize an open crack in a bladed disk structure {{and analyze the}} effect of a crack on both the vibrational response of a compressor single blade and bladed disk. A fracture analysis study is carried out in ANSYS by manually meshing the region around the crack front and compared with results from a special purpose fracture code, FRANC 3 D. A good agreement is achieved for the Mode I and Mode II stress intensity factors, while there is a significant difference for the Mode III stress intensity factor. Based on the applied boundary conditions, the crack is likely to propagate in a mixed mode of propagation. Modal analysis of the single blade revealed that the natural frequency decreases as the size of the crack increases and increases as the rotational speed increases. A similar trend is obtained within different <b>modal</b> <b>families</b> of the bladed disk, but for certain frequencies within <b>modal</b> <b>families,</b> the bladed disk mode is localized about the cracked blade. When studying the efficacy of using a single blade analysis for purposes of structural health monitoring, it is found that for certain vibration modes, there is {{a significant difference between the}} natural frequencies of the single blade and the bladed disk, suggesting that a single bladed analysis alone may not suffice.|$|R

In addition, the amplitude magnification factor considering the Coriolis effects is increased by 1. 02 % compared to the system without considering the Coriolis effects as the rotating speed is 3000 [*]rpm, while the amplitude magnification factor is increased by 2. 76 % as the rotating speed is 10000 [*]rpm. The results indicate that the amplitude magnification factor may be moderately enhanced with the increasing of rotating speed.

The notion of a frame is as usual, but now truth values at possible worlds are members of L and not just true and false. Propositional connectives are dealt with in the obvious way.

Using the topological classification described by the kneading theory, introduced by J. Milnor and W. Thurston, and its description in terms of Markov transition matrices, developed by J.

Thus, in chapter 2 we introduce a symbolic product of self-similarity, and study some properties of the growth number for the invariants belonging to these structures. Then, in chapters 3 and 4, we consider the families of Markov matrices associated with the uni modal and bimodal kneading invariants and study them using two algebraic the first ones, finitely generated abelian groups, we present some particular results that support two conjectures for the totality of the matrices.

40|$|Research topic Domain {{specific}} ontologies {{are intended}} to provide a commonly shared understanding among several user communities. Concepts and their relationships are used to explicitly model the real world phenomena that are of interest to users of specific domain. In reality, a set of applications of a specific domain use different representations of the same real world entity due to various abstraction mechanisms, viewpoints, context, and specific interest. In the last decades, the notion of context has been applied by the AI and computer science as part of abstracting and building conceptual models for knowledge representation systems, and very recently in semantic Web and context-aware computation. In our research, the context will be adapted as meta-data to annotate ontological information elements (concepts, roles, objects, attributes, etc.) to describe their contextual information. Our specific objective is to express ontological information elements as a data set with the multiple perspectives using a modal description logics language (Modal ALCN). Problems and objectives In the dissertation, we are investigating the multi-representations problem {{and its impact on}} semantic heterogeneity for domain-specific ontology. The focal points of this work are: (i) study the requirements of the multiple representations ontologies based on the notion of context, and (ii) formalize the multi-representation ontologies by exploiting contextual description logic language that must be used to express context-dependent domain ontologies. This research was inspired by the fact that multi-representations may be an acute source for semantics interoperability and the future need for the coordination among multi-representations systems. Moreover, multi-representations systems provide users with several views of information in different contexts. Hence, constructing ontology based on context can disambiguate multi-represented objects and participate in resolving semantic heterogeneity. Moreover, by contextual ontology approach we allow local inconsistencies and enhance modularity of a set of ontologies (multiple ontologies). There are also other benefits from constructing contextual ontologies namely tracking of dynamic changes and versioning, collaborative modular development among diversified communities in the same domain. Our approach The approach is not intended for integrating a set of ontologies, but rather to preserve the semantics of those ontologies according to their local views or contexts for the purpose of accessing, filtering and querying heterogeneous sources. Our goal in this research will be to tackle the problem of multi-representation from the semantics viewpoint by providing a well-defined rich model to multi-representation ontologies as well as supporting ontology mappings (context based) when integration is not possible or infeasible. There are approaches similar to this approach namely contextualizing Ontologies or C-OWL, Distributed Descriptions Logics, and multi-context systems. In the C-OWL approach, an extension of the syntax and semantics of OWL is proposed to allow for the representation of contextual ontologies. In Distributed Description Logics, an extension of the logical formalism of Description Logics is intended for loosely coupled federations of information systems (IS), where the local IS preserves a degree of monotony. Our approach is somewhat similar to the C-OWL approach but our objectives are different. First, our approach will be dedicated to the multi-representations problem of ontological elements. Secondly, we propose constructs of modal description logics to describe the structural relationships between contexts. Third, the proposed contextual language is exploiting some modalities of modal logics to support the accessibility of information based on contexts. In brief, our approach will be dedicated to (i) study and analyze contextual ontology requirements, (ii) Extend description logics existing languages to support the notion of contextual ontologies Proposed framework The Figure below illustrates the association of information systems to their local ontologies. Each information system is supported by local ontology to gain semantically sound representation. The notion of context associated with local ontology can play the role of partitioning the ontological information. Furthermore, developing several ontologies in the same domain of interest will require ontology mapping, merging and/or alignment based on context. Multiple ontolgies can be: (i) disjoint such that no concepts are common, (ii) overlapped where concepts are commonly shared, and (ii) subsumed such that ontology is contained in another one. In this work, we consider the last two cases where ontologies overlap or subsume one another. In overlapping ontologies, ontological concept, represented by a class, may conceptually occur in other ontology as well. In all ontologies, where the concept occurs, a different context for that concept is considered. Thus, we have the problem of expressing the relationships between the different concepts in different ontologies that actually represent the same concept in different contexts (multi-representation problem). The approach works as it follows: 1. Ontologies are kept as the domain experts built them. Several ontologies are built according to the need and interests of a group of users of a specific domain. 2. Contexts are used as labelling mechanism to distinguish ontological information. 3. Formalizing concepts by exploiting proposed contextual description logics language. 4. Mappings, based on context, are defined between relevant portions of two local ontologies to express the occurrences of the same concept in different contexts. Interpretation of a concept is done according to context (s) where it occurs. The framework of the proposed approach The advantages of the proposed approach are: • No modification to the domain ontologies, since each group is responsible for its own local ontology. • The approach promotes modularity in the ontologies developed for a specific domain of interest. • Domain experts are relieved from the difficult task of reaching consensus (ontological commitments) among a set of users in the domain. • Semantically sound representation for multi-represented ontological elements, which may be valid in one context and not valid in another. Hence, inconsistent local ontologies are permitted. Contribution Our contributions to contextual ontology will be summarized in the following. • We explore and emphasize the significance of the notion of context for efficient abstraction and information space partitioning of ontological information elements. • We specify the requirements of contextual ontologies as well as their impact on future conceptual system modelling and systems interoperation. • We devise formalism for contextual ontology by extending language constructs of <b>modal</b> description logic <b>family</b> (ALCNM) to cope with the problem of the multi-representation ontological concepts. Les ontologies de domaine sont prévues pour fournir une compréhension généralement partagée parmi plusieurs communautés d'utilisateur. Les ontologies comportent des concepts, des instances, des liens entre concepts, et des axiomes. Ces derniers sont employés pour modéliser explicitement les phénomènes du monde réel d'un domaine spécifique. En réalité, un ensemble d'applications d'un domaine spécifique emploie différentes ontologies. Par conséquent, les différentes représentations de la même entité du monde réel existent en raison de divers mécanismes abstraits, des points de vue, du niveau de détails, et d'intérêt de l'utilisateur. Dans les dernières décennies, la notion du contexte a été utilisée par l'Intelligence Artificielle (IA) et l'informatique en tant qu'élément pour abstraire et établir les modèles conceptuels, systèmes de représentation de la connaissance, et très récemment dans les applications contextuelles. Dans notre recherche, l'information contextuelle est prise en compte en adoptant la notion du contexte et en l'intégrant dans la description des éléments ontologiques (concepts, rôles, objets, attributs, etc.). Notre objectif est d'exprimer les éléments ontologiques dépendants du contexte comme un ensemble de données avec des perspectives multiples en utilisant les logiques de description. Plus précisément, nous étudions une approche pour décrire les ontologies qui partagent l'entité du monde réel avec des représentations multiples. Notre recherche est focalisée sur deux secteurs : (i) les besoins des ontologies avec des représentations multiples et (ii) un formalisme pour exprimer les ontologies de domaine qui peuvent exister dans différents contextes. Cette recherche a été motivée par le fait que les représentations peuvent changer selon différents critères tels que le point de vue, la granularité d'information disponible, la classification des concepts, le temps, l'espace, etc. En fait, les repréeentations multiples des phénomènes du monde réel sont de plus en plus standardisé...|$|R

By endowing the Hamiltonian {{with the role of}} selecting the subset of the definite-valued observables of the system, it accounts for ideal and non-ideal measurements, and also supplies a criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements in the non-ideal case. It can be reformulated in an explicitly invariant form, in terms of the Casimir operators of the Galilean group, and the compatibility of the MHI with the theory of decoherence has been proved. Nevertheless, perhaps its main advantage in the eyes of a scientist is given by its several applications to well-known physical situations, leading to results compatible with experimental evidence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to add a new application to the list: the case of optical isomerism, which is a central issue for the philosophy of physics and of chemistry since it points to the core of the problem of the relationship between physics and chemistry.

40|$|International audienceThe present work targets shaft {{whirling}} motions {{induced by}} direct blade/casing unilateral contact occurrences in aircraft engine bladed-disk assemblies. These contact events are favored by increasingly reduced blade-tip clearances and potentially lead to harmful interactions that may threaten the engine structural integrity. A simplified 2 D in-plane {{finite element model}} representative of the engine fan stage is built, accounting for {{the flexibility of the}} shaft through two linear springs attached to the disk center node and the structural coupling provided by the fan frame and the bearings, modeled by an array of linear springs. A linear stability analysis of the reduced-order coupled system reveals two unstable zones in a selected rotational speed range, emanating from the linearly predicted modal coincidence speeds. Through a time-marching strategy, two asymmetric contact initiation mechanisms are investigated: (1) a prescribed casing distortion and (2) a mass imbalance on the bladed-disk. It is shown how the 1 -nodal diameter mode of the first <b>modal</b> <b>family</b> of the bladed-disk is dominant when a modal interaction arises from the transient casing distortion and leads to divergent regimes. The presence of the frame/bearings coupling induces a shift in the critical speeds detected, generally characterized by a backward traveling wave in the rotating frame and a forward traveling one in the fixed frame. Further, when a mass imbalance is the excitation source, the suspension modes appear to have a major role and a stable limit cycle is reached regardless of the coupling stiffness with much lower energy levels than in divergent regime...|$|E
