The Europa Barbarorum team felt that such factions' representations in Rome: Total War conformed <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hollywood stereotype than to historical fact, and wished to see a more realistic portrayal of such factions in the game.

500|$|In 1950, Spanish American novelists were tolerated but {{marginal}} in {{the literary}} landscape, with Paris and New York representing {{the center of the}} literary world; by 1975 they were celebrated as central figures. [...] As well as being a publishing phenomenon, the Boom introduced a series of novel aesthetic and stylistic features to world literature. [...] In generaland considering there are many countries and hundreds of important authorsat the start of the period, Realism prevails, with novels tinged by an existentialist pessimism, with well-rounded characters lamenting their destinies, and a straightforward narrative line. In the 1960s, language loosens up, gets hip, pop, streetwise, characters are much more complex, and the chronology becomes intricate, making of the reader an active participant in the deciphering of the text. Late in the period the political adventure goes sour, while the linguistic sophistication reaches a new height, and novelists turn <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reflection on their own writing, a fiction on fiction or metafiction, while characters and story lines show the corrosive power of a postmodern society, where all is equally available and insignificant.|$|E

500|$|In November 1959, after {{twelve years}} as a {{professional}} musician, Ray Charles signed with ABC Records, following the expiration of his Atlantic Records contract. According to Will Friedwald in A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, [...] "His first four ABC albums were all primarily devoted to standards..." [...] In the 1960s, he experienced crossover success with both rhythm and blues and country music. Because Charles was signed to ABC as a rhythm and blues singer, he decided to wait until his contract was up for its three-year renewal before experimenting with country music, although {{he wanted to do}} so sooner. With the assistance of ABC executive Sid Feller, he gathered a set of country songs to record, despite the wishes of ABC. The release of his 1962 country albums Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its follow-up Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2 broadened the appeal of his music to the mainstream. At this point, Charles began to appeal <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> white audience. In 1962 he founded his own record label, Tangerine Records, which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed.|$|E
500|$|For the localizations of Persona 3 and 4, {{the team}} {{incorporated}} {{as much of}} the original content as possible, such as using Japanese honorifics and keeping the game's currency as yen rather than changing it. As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes. Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues. The Social Links were originally called [...] but this was changed as the word [...] "Community" [...] had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as [...] "society" [...] and [...] "bonds". Some in-game Easter egg references were also changed: in Persona 3 references to Shin Megami Tensei by a character in an in-game MMORPG were changed to reference earlier Persona games, while mentions of a fictional detective in Persona 4 were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from Eternal Punishment and the Devil Summoner series. Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of Persona 4 character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> western audience. Persona 5 is planned to be localized in this fashion.|$|E
