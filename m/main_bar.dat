40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a strategy to}} enhance the current provision for antibuckling design of lateral ties. The resulting design method will restrict the buckling-induced reduction of average compressive stress of <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> to an allowable limit until the desired level of ductility is attained. First, a method to determine the maximum compressive strain likely to be experienced by the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> is described. Based on an average compressive stress-strain relationship of reinforcing bars, evaluation of bar buckling parameter (a function of slenderness ratio and yield strength of the bar) required to restrict the loss of compressive stress at the maximum compressive strain to a tolerable limit is then explained. For a bar of known diameter and yield strength, the maximum allowable tie spacing can then be determined. Next, lateral stiffness required to restrain the buckling tendency of the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> at the tie locations is expressed {{as a function of}} the geometrical and mechanical properties of the <b>main</b> <b>bars.</b> Similarly, the anti-buckling stiffness of the lateral ties is also derived {{as a function of the}} mechanical and geometrical properties of the lateral ties. Finally, a design framework to decide the spacing, amount and arrangement of lateral ties is established...|$|R

25|$|The area {{towards the}} western end of Lockhart Road, {{including}} {{a small part of the}} parallel Jaffe Road, is one of Hong Kong island's two <b>main</b> <b>bar</b> districts (the other being the more upmarket Lan Kwai Fong in Central). Once considered primarily as a red light district, this area is now more diverse with bars, pubs, restaurants and discos. A number of the raunchier bars still remain, however, their doorways festooned with women from Thailand and the Philippines. The famous novel and film The World of Suzie Wong sets many scenes in this area. The bar district has been popular with visiting sailors and navies, when Fenwick Pier, west of the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre (HKECE), was in use as a military pier.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} <b>main</b> <b>bar,</b> {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E

25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the <b>main</b> <b>bar</b> and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E

But why? This paper presents a hypothesis {{to answer the questions}} : a stirrup bar and its neighboring concrete constitute a small triangular beam, which covers lapped <b>main</b> <b>bars.</b> Thus, the strength of lap splice is affected by the flexural strength of the triangular beams, not by the yield strength of shear reinforcement.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{reliable}} methods of assessing the load-carrying capacity and remaining service life of corroded structures. Previous research has been mainly concerned with lower corrosion levels leading to cover cracking. Moreover, {{the main focus of}} the available knowledge concerns the corrosion of the main reinforcement; while the corrosion of the stirrups is often overlooked. Therefore, these two uncertainties; i. e. high amount of corrosion leading to extensive cover cracking and spalling and the effect of corroding stirrups, were investigated in an experimental program. Pull-out tests were carried out on eccentrically reinforced specimens with long embedment length to study the anchorage capacity of a corroded bar. The influences of the location of the anchored bar, i. e. middle or corner placement; {{the presence or absence of}} transverse reinforcement; the corrosion level of longitudinal reinforcement and the corrosion of transverse reinforcement were studied. The specimens were of three types in relation to the reinforcement arrangement and corrosion: specimens without stirrups, where the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> were corroded (type A); specimens with stirrups where the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> were corroded and the stirrups were protected by insulating tape (type B); and specimens with stirrups where the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> and stirrups were corroded (type C). All of the specimens were subjected to accelerated corrosion, with an average current density of 100 µA/cm 2, for three time spans that caused a rebar weight loss up to approximately 20 % in the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> and 35 % in the stirrups. All of the specimens showed longitudinal cracks along the <b>main</b> <b>bars</b> for relatively low corrosion levels. The corrosion level at first cracking was about 0. 6 % 1. 0 % corrosion weight loss; the cracks widened with increased corrosion levels. Crack patterns formed depended on the presence or absence of stirrups and whether the stirrups were corroded. The crack patterns showed differences between specimens with or without stirrups and when stirrups are corroding or not. The tests showed an important effect of the cover cracking in terms of loss of confinement. They also indicated that the bond behaviour and the failure were strongly governed by the position of the anchored bar, i. e. corner or middle positions, and the level of the corrosion attack. Stirrups played an important role after cover cracking, as they then became the primary source of confinement. The knowledge gained in this study contributes to better understanding of the effects of deterioration on structures...|$|R

6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this excessive production of sweets in modern times is, of course, that we have begun to distrust the indications afforded us by the sense of taste in this particular as to the wholesomeness of various objects. We can mix sugar with anything we like, whether it had sugar in it to begin with or otherwise; and by sweetening and flavouring we can give a false palatableness to even the worst and most indigestible rubbish, such as plaster-of-Paris, largely sold {{under the name of}} sugared almonds to the ingenuous youth of two hemispheres. But in untouched nature the test rarely or never fails. As long as fruits are unripe and unfit for human food, they are green and sour; as soon as they ripen they become soft and sweet, and usually acquire some bright colour as a sort of advertisement of their edibility. In the <b>main,</b> <b>bar</b> the accidents of civilisation, whatever is sweet is good to eat--nay more, is meant to be eaten; it is only our own perverse folly that makes us sometimes think all nice things bad for us, and all wholesome things nasty. In a state of nature, the exact opposite is really the case. One may observe, too, that children, who are literally young savages in more senses than one, stand nearer to the primitive feeling in this respect than grown-up people. They unaffectedly like sweets; adults, who have grown more accustomed to the artificial meat diet, don't, as a rule, care much for puddings, cakes, and made dishes. (May I venture parenthetically to add, any appearance to the contrary notwithstanding, that I am not a vegetarian, and that I am far from desiring to bring down upon my devoted head the imprecation pronounced against the rash person who would rob a poor man of his beer. It is quite possible to believe that vegetarianism was the starting point of the race, without wishing to consider it also as the goal; just as it is quite possible to regard clothes as purely artificial products of civilisation, without desiring personally to return to the charming simplicity of the Garden of Eden.) ...|$|E
