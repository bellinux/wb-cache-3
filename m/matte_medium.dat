5000|$|Materials used include rusted wire, {{shattered}} glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, {{the artificial}} {{leg of a}} dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art. His work is washed in blue [...] "corrosion," [...] a mix of <b>matte</b> <b>medium,</b> copper powder, and salt. Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched {{from the bottom of}} the sea.|$|E
5000|$|The metaphysical books (on {{topics such}} as the seven rays) written by the New Age Prophetess Alice A. Bailey (which she claimed to have channeled from the ascended master Djwal Khul), {{published}} by the Lucis Trust and called by her followers the Alice A. Bailey material, in earlier editions {{up to and including}} the 1970s were originally bound in <b>matte</b> <b>medium</b> Persian blue, but since the 1980s, they have been bound in glossy Persian blue.|$|E
50|$|The robust shrub grows densely {{and remains}} rather small, {{reaching}} only about 80 to 120 centimeters (2.5 to 4 ft) height at a width of 60 to 90 centimeters (2 to 3 ft). The arching shoots bear small, <b>matte,</b> <b>medium</b> green leaves. Wife of Bath is disease resistant and winter hardy down to -23 °C (USDA zone 6 and warmer), and half shade tolerant. The variety is grown {{on its own}} roots and can be planted solitary, in groups, or as hedges, but is also suitable as container plant and as cut flower. Due to its size and floriferousness, the cultivar is well suited for small gardens.|$|E
40|$|Posidonia oceanica is a {{widespread}} coastal Mediterranean seagrass which accumulates in its subsurface large quantities of organic material derived from its roots, rhizomes and leaf sheaths embedded in sandy sediments. These organic deposits may be up to several meters thick as they accumulate over thousands of years forming the matte, whose high content in organic carbon {{plays a major role}} in the global ocean carbon cycle. In this study, very high-resolution seismo-acoustic methods were applied to image the subsurface features of a P. oceanica seagrass meadow at Portlligat (Cadaqués, Girona, Spain), in the NW-Mediterranean Sea. Our findings yield fresh insights into the settling of the P. oceanica meadow in the study area, and define with unprecedented detail the potential volume occupied by the matte. A strong reflector, located from 4. 3 to 11. 7 m depth, was recognized in several seismo-acoustic profiles as the substratum on which P. oceanica first settled in the study area. A 3 D bathymetric model of this substratum allowed us to reconstruct the Portlligat palaeo-environment prior to the settling of P. oceanica, which corresponded to a shallow coastal setting protected from the open sea. A core drilled in the meadow at Portlligat revealed the presence of a 6 m thick dense <b>matte</b> composed of <b>medium</b> to coarse sandy sediments mixed with plant debris and bioclasts. Radiocarbon datings revealed a constant accretion rate of the matte of about 1. 1 m/kyr. Gravelly bioclastic deposits observed at the base of the core correspond to the base of the matte and gave a date of 5616 ± 46 Cal yr BP. For the first time, very high-resolution marine geophysical techniques allowed us to accurately define the volume occupied by P. oceanica matte, which in the study area reaches up to almost 220, 000 ± 17, 400 m 3. This result is an important step forward in our efforts to estimate the size of the carbon sink represented by P. oceanica meadows along the Mediterranean coasts significantly contributing to the biosphere carbon cycle.
