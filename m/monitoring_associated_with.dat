40|$|Objective We {{examined}} {{the role of}} parental monitoring (general and diabetes specific) on metabolic control through better adherence and lower externalizing behaviors for adolescents with type 1 diabetes.  Methods Adolescents aged 10 – 14 (n = 252) completed assessments of general and diabetes-specific mothers’ and fathers’ monitoring, adherence, and the Youth Self Report (YSR). Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) indexed diabetes control.  Results Path analyses revealed that perceived mothers’ general <b>monitoring</b> was indirectly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower HbA 1 c through lower externalizing behaviors and higher adherence. Perceived fathers’ general <b>monitoring</b> was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> HbA 1 c differently at the extremes: low fathers’ <b>monitoring</b> was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> higher HbA 1 c through higher externalizing behaviors; high fathers’ <b>monitoring</b> was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> HbA 1 c through higher adherence.

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{companies}} voluntarily change their financial reporting conservatism {{in response to}} an exogenous decrease in analyst coverage.

Consistent with this prediction, we document a significant increase in accounting conservatism following an exogenous drop in analyst coverage. Furthermore, the effect is stronger when the dropped analyst is more informed and when the affected firm has a higher financial leverage ratio, less favorable credit ratings, and a higher proportion of cash-based CEO compensation. The overall evidence is consistent with the notion that accounting conservatism arises as part of the efficient technology employed by firms to address agency problems between contracting parties...|$|E

Similarly, a patient on a novel anticoagulant may present to the emergency department due to a hemorrhagic complication. Consequently, the emergency physician should be familiar with the newer and older anticoagulants.

Generated gas-path information is used to diagnose internal component degradation and retune the control system accordingly, to reduce deterioration effects on performance and consequent needs for preventive or unscheduled maintenance.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} group incentives on productivity, pay and employment in a large unionised firm in India. Using plant-level monthly time series data from the payroll office for the period 1985 - 95, and controlling for both (plant) fixed effects and (contract) time effects, the paper provides econometric evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} both the level and intensity of incentive pay on the outcome measures. In addition, the relative performance of two types of group incentives defined on the basis of group size is also analysed. At the firm level, the results generally confirm predictions from theory that productivity returns to centives are non-linear and concave in shape and that the effectiveness of incentives is decreasing in group size. I argue that the latter is most likely due to the lessening of the free-rider problem and the increased effectiveness of peer/mutual <b>monitoring</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> smaller groups.

40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} for rotating machinery diagnostics; however measuring vibration of operational oil well pumps is not possible. The pump’s driver’s current signatures may provide condition-related information {{without the need for}} an access to the pump itself. This paper investigates the degree of relationship between the pump’s driver’s current signatures and its induced vibration. This relationship between the driver’s current signatures (DCS) and its vibration signatures (DVS) is studied by calculating magnitude-squared coherence and phase coherence parameters at a certain frequency band using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The CWT coherence-based technique allows better analysis of temporal evolution of the frequency content of dynamic signals and areas in the time-frequency plane where the two signals exhibit common power or consistent phase behaviour indicating a relationship between the signals. This novel approach is validated by experimental data acquired from 3 [*]kW petroleum pump’s driver. Both vibration and current signatures were acquired under different speed and load conditions. The outcomes of this research suggest the use of DCS analysis as reliable and inexpensive condition monitoring tool, which could be implemented for oil pumps, real-time <b>monitoring</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> condition-based maintenance (CBM) program...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{accuracy}} requirements of system performance and suppressing the cost of <b>monitoring</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the physical constraints, many researchers {{has focused on the}} design of optimal sensor systems along with the requirement to perform a specific observation extensively. It is obvious that the optimal sensor allocation is a required tool in enhancing performance qualities from structural control problems. Measures of optimality often include the quality of controllability, the observability and information matrix. The problem of optimal sensor placement for decentralized discrete-time systems was investigated in the literature, and that work is based on optimizing the observation matrices with constraints. The observation matrices with constraints can be considered as a natural optimality measure, since the coefficients of these matrices are a valid evidence to measure state variables by the controller. Therefore, a smaller number of output variables can be achieved by optimally allocating a linear combination of these measurements. In this paper, we extend this idea to the decentralized unified regulator problem using output feedback. For application, structural systems having natural frequency can be considered, where sensors can be located in a finite number of positions. To verify the validity and effectiveness, numerical results are presented...|$|E
