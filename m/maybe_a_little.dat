[...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential.

After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked [...] to avoid a section of snowless trail, then {{had to deal with}} open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival.

[...] Another suitemate said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: [...] "It's just an opinionbut Ted was brilliant." [...] Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; another Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him [...] "very quiet, but personable...

500|$|For {{the lead}} single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, Polydor {{presented}} the band four singles choices, including [...] "The Show", [...] "Wake Me Up", [...] "Graffiti My Soul", and [...] "Androgynous Girls". Although [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] was the preferred choice, and also Sarah Harding's favorite from the album, it was deemed as sounding too harsh {{and the record}} company didn't {{want to take the}} risk. They also added [...] "Androgynous Girls" [...] as a b-side to the album's second single three months later. [...] "The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able {{to have a lot of}} fun working on ideas that were <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too odd to be on the radio," [...] Higgins said.

500|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] starred Denis Lawson, Joyce Veheary, Oona Chaplin and Kayvan Novak. Pemberton commented on the appropriateness of casting Chaplin, a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin, in an episode with little dialogue. Shearsmith stressed that the episode should not be considered a silent film {{in the same way as}} Charlie Chaplin's, elsewhere saying that the casting was [...] "almost an accident but <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nod". Bruce Dessau, writing in The Independent, described the casting choice as [...] "a satisfying nod to silent cinema". Both Oona Chaplin and the Inside No. 9 executive producer Jon Plowman stressed, however, that there was no significance in the casting. Chaplin also said that her character was very unlike herself, explaining that the [...] "big boobs, the heels, the blonde wig ... freed [...] up amazingly".|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic {{gave the}} album a mildly {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "amid the austerity of post-punk England, {{and before we}} became awash with irony and archness, we needed a band who could raise their eyebrows and smirk at it all without ever being condescending (or <b>maybe</b> only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit condescending)." ...|$|R

500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that}} the song seemed [...] "tailor-made" [...] for him, playing on the {{strengths}} {{that led him to}} win American Idol. Montgomery also said, [...] "his husky, broad voice, shuffly guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – and wraps them in a well-worn, subtly sexy tune, full of wide-eyed, dare we say inspirational sentiments. Yet, at the same time, it's also incredibly earnest in tone." [...] Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as [...] "surprising, and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win". [...] In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as [...] "very catchy, a bit inspirational", and [...] "energetic". She praised the chorus and further commended the song as [...] "a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post-show single".|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E

[...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E

500|$|However, {{despite an}} [...] "embarrassing" [...] {{meeting between the}} label and the girls, [...] "Love Machine" [...] was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being {{released}} on 13 September 2004.

500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater."

500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. hide contributed several songs, including the single [...] "Scars", while Pata's only claim is [...] "White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata's Nap~". Toshi's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music {{to a couple of}} songs, notably [...] "Voiceless Screaming" [...] from the album Jealousy, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and Desperate Angel. Heath's only writing credit is the instrumental song [...] "Wriggle" [...] on the 1996 album Dahlia, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, [...] "Easy Fight Rambling" [...] on the 1989 album Blue Blood. Of songs from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track [...] "Time Trip Loving" [...] from the single [...] "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since. That year, Yoshiki claimed that their new material was [...] "pretty much the same thing, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> edgier." [...] However, in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before, adding that it will be very heavy, melodic, and [...] "more contemporary." ...|$|E

Henrik Jonback confirmed that he had written songs with her during the European leg of The Onyx Hotel Tour, [...] "in the bus and in her hotel room between the concerts." [...] Following her marriage with Kevin Federline in October 2004, Spears announced through a letter on her official website {{that she was going}} to [...] "take some time off to enjoy life." [...] However, on December 30, 2004, she made a surprise appearance at Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM to premiere a rough mix of a new midtempo track, [...] "Mona Lisa". Spears had recorded the song live with her band while on tour, and dedicated it to all the [...] "legends and icons out there." [...] The lyrics lament the fall of Mona Lisa, calling her [...] "unforgettable" [...] and [...] "unpredictable", and cautions listeners not to have a [...] "breakdown". She also revealed she wanted the song to be the first single of her upcoming album, tentatively titled The Original Doll, and hoped to release it [...] "probably before summertime , or <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sooner than that."

[...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to.

500|$|Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} their debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. [...] The album was recorded from April to September 2004.

2500|$|Q-Tip {{was upset}} over the album's {{shelving}} {{and felt that}} although Reid {{did not know how}} to market it, his label released OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2003: [...] "hose are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract. <b>Maybe</b> even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more out [...] Kamaal was just me, guerrilla".

5000|$|While this eclecticism {{appealed to}} the band's fans, it also made them {{difficult}} for a major label to market - some of their later albums, especially Introducing Happiness, were described by critics as playing more like compilation albums than {{the work of a}} single band with a coherent and unified vision. Bobby Baker of The Tragically Hip remarked in 1997, [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> they're <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too good for their own good." ...|$|R
