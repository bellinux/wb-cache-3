40|$|We are {{developing}} a biosensor system, the Bead ARray Counter (BARC), based on the capture and detection of micron-sized, paramagnetic beads on a chip containing an array of giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors. Here we describe the design and performance of our current chip with 64 sensor zones, compare its performance with the previous chip design, and discuss a simple analytical model of the sensor micromagnetics. With assay-ready Dynal M- 280 microbeads (2. 8 µm diameter), our threshold for detection is approximately 10 beads per 200 µm-diameter sensor. Single beads made of solid Ni 30 Fe 70 can easily be detected, but they must be made biocompatible.

40|$|The Department of Energy has {{initiated}} its Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP) {{to provide a}} single, integrated technical program for maintaining the continued safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile {{in the absence of}} nuclear testing. Consistent with the SSMP, the Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) has been conceived to provide improved radiographic imaging with multiple axes and multiple time frames. The AHF would be used to better understand the evolution of nuclear weapon primary implosion shape under normal and accident scenarios. There are three fundamental technologies currently under consideration for use on the AHF. These include linear induction acceleration, inductive-adder pulsed-power technology (both technologies using high current electron beams to produce an intense X-ray beam) and high-energy proton accelerators to produce a proton beam. The Scrounge-atron (a proton synchrotron) was conceived to be a relatively low cost demonstration of the viability of the third technology using bursts of energetic protons, <b>magnetic</b> lenses, and <b>particle</b> <b>detectors</b> to produce the radiographic image. In order for the Scrounge-atron to provide information useful for the AHF technology decision, the accelerator would have to be built as quickly and as economically as possible. These conditions can be met by "scrounging" parts from decommissioned accelerators across the country, especially the Main Ring at Fermilab. The Scrounge-atron is designed to meet the baseline parameters for single axis proton radiography: a 20 GeV proton beam of ten pulses, 10 degrees protons each, spaced 250 ns apart. (2 refs) ...|$|R
