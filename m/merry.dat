5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} new companion Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) to the Rings of Akhaten, where several planets revolve around a larger one. They attend a religious festival where the young Queen of Years, <b>Merry</b> Gejelh (Emilia Jones), {{is about to}} be sacrificed. Determined to save <b>Merry,</b> the Doctor and Clara come face-to-face with the parasite of Akhaten, who requires memories, stories, and items of sentimental value.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. <b>Merry</b> begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. <b>Merry</b> panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises <b>Merry</b> that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force <b>Merry</b> to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and <b>Merry</b> escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term <b>Merry</b> Lude, referring to a <b>merry</b> game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The <b>Merry</b> Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. The <b>Merry</b> Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E

5|$|How to Marry a Millionaire, which aired from 1957 to 1959, {{was based}} on the popular 1953 film of the same name. The series starred Barbara Eden, <b>Merry</b> Anders, Lori Nelson (1957–1958), and Lisa Gaye (1958–1959). The final episode aired in August 1959.|$|E

5|$|In {{gathering}} inspirations for Wrapped in Red, Clarkson {{started by}} listening to Bing Crosby's and Rosemary Clooney's soundtracks from the 1954 feature film White Christmas, as well as Mariah Carey's <b>Merry</b> Christmas (1994) and <b>Merry</b> Christmas to You (1997) by Reba McEntire. While Greg Kurstin, who used {{to play in a}} jazz band, took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance. Clarkson also cited that her relationship with her then-fiancé Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.|$|E

5|$|The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both {{suggest that}} Low was set adrift without {{provisions}} by {{the crew of}} the <b>Merry</b> Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument.

Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E

5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer.

This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 successes, The Only Thing and The <b>Merry</b> Widow.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put it {{out of the reach of}} many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The <b>Merry</b> Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E
5|$|<b>Merry</b> Christmas debuted {{at number}} thirty on the US Billboard 200 with 45,000 copies sold {{in its first}} week.

5|$|On 21 March 2006, Firoz Kassam {{sold the}} club, {{including}} its debts, for approximately £2 million to Florida-based businessman Nick <b>Merry,</b> {{who had played}} for United's youth team in the mid-1970s. <b>Merry</b> immediately made changes to the club, including the hiring of former manager Jim Smith in his second spell. Despite signing five new players {{on his first day}} in charge, Smith was unable to prevent relegation {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season. After 44 years in English league football, Oxford were relegated to the Conference National after finishing in 23rd place, becoming the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the league. Coincidentally, Accrington Stanley, the club whose bankruptcy in 1962 allowed United to be elected into the League, was one of the two clubs promoted to replace them.|$|E
