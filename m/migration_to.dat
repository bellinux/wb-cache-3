5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian <b>migration</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E

As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great <b>Migration</b> <b>to</b> northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E

The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged <b>migration</b> <b>to</b> the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E
