500|$|Al-Wasat (literally, [...] "The Center") {{was founded}} on September 2002 and its co-founder al-Jamri became its editor-in-chief. By 2011 it had become the country's most popular {{newspaper}} with a daily circulation of 15,000 and readership of 45,000 to 60,000. It employed 200 individuals, a quarter of them worked as reporters or editors. Its coverage was described by Committee to Protect Journalists as independent and non-sectarian, however this did not spare it from occasional harassment and political pressure. Al-Wasat is the only independent and non-sectarian newspaper in the county and is also [...] "widely credited with being the first Bahraini newspaper to voice opposition views". Although it also covers the government point of view, the newspaper is sometimes classified as siding with opposition. According to <b>Margaret</b> <b>Warner</b> of PBS NewsHour, Al-Wasat is the [...] "most popular and profitable newspaper" [...] in Bahrain and al-Jamri's column is a [...] "voice for non-sectarian moderation".|$|E

50|$|Shaw {{is widely}} {{known for the}} {{question}} he posed to Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Michael Dukakis at his second Presidential debate with George H. W. Bush during the 1988 election, which Shaw was moderating. Knowing that Dukakis opposed the death penalty, Shaw {{asked him if he}} would support an irrevocable death penalty for a man who hypothetically raped and murdered Dukakis's wife. Dukakis responded that he would not; critics felt he framed his response too legalistically and logically, and did not address it sufficiently on a personal level. Kitty Dukakis, among other public figures, found the question inflammatory and unwarranted at a presidential debate. Several journalists also on the panel with Shaw, including Ann Compton, Andrea Mitchell, and <b>Margaret</b> Garrard <b>Warner,</b> expressed an interest in leaving Dukakis's name out of the question.|$|R
