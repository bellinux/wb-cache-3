Using the <b>metal-backed</b> seats then in use as a means of comparison, several new seat designs were tested.

40|$|We {{examined}} radiographic polyethylene wear in 233 cemented total hip arthroplasties (201 patients) {{with either}} a <b>metal-backed</b> or a non-metal-backed acetabular cup. All patients had identical cemented one-piece titanium femoral stems with a femoral head diameter of 28 mm. The mean linear wear rate was 0. 11 mm/yr in <b>metal-backed</b> sockets and 0. 08 mm/yrin non-metal-backed sockets(p = 0. 0002). The mean volumetric wear rate was 66. 2 mm 3 /yr in the <b>metal-backed</b> sockets and 48. 2 mm 3 /yr in the polyethylene sockets (p = 0. 0002). The addition of metal backing to a cemented acetabu-lar cup therefore resulted in a 37 % increase in mean polyethylene wear rates which may partially explain the higher failure rate of cemented <b>metal-backed</b> cups.

40|$|The {{outcome of}} {{isolated}} patellar component revisions after <b>metal-backed</b> patellar failure is variable with satisfactory results reported from 78 % to 100 %. To supplement {{information in the}} literature we determined the failure rate and the functional outcome based on the Knee Society clinical and roentgenographic evaluation systems of isolated patellar component revisions after <b>metal-backed</b> patellar component failure. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with 28 isolated patellar component revisions for <b>metal-backed</b> patellar component failure performed between 1988 and 2005. Twenty-five knees in 24 patients were available for review with a minimum followup of 24  months (mean, 90  months; range, 24 – 210  months). All knees were revised with a cemented all-polyethylene patellar component and all tibial polyethylene components were routinely exchanged. One failure (4 %) occurred 122. 6  months after the isolated patellar component revision secondary to femoral and tibial component loosening. The average Knee Society knee score improved from 73 to 89 points, whereas the average Knee Society function score improved from 56 to 65.

40|$|Currently, {{the use of}} <b>metal-backed</b> tibial {{components}} is {{more common}} than the use of all-polyethylene components in total knee arthroplasty. However, the available literature indicates that all-polyethylene tibial components are not inferior to the <b>metal-backed</b> design. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} no difference in the ten-year survival rate between all-polyethylene and <b>metal-backed</b> tibial components of a specific design in a large nationwide cohort. METHODS: In the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register, we identified 27, 733 cruciate-retaining total knee replacements using the press-fit condylar prosthesis with either <b>metal-backed</b> or all-polyethylene tibial components inserted from 1999 to 2011. Unadjusted survival functions were calculated with the end points of revision for any reason, revision due to infection, and revision due to reasons other than infection, and the differences between the groups were investigated with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to analyze the influence of various covariates on the adjusted relative risk of revision. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 4. 5 years (range, zero to 12. 9 years). Of all total knee replacements, 16, 896 (60. 9 %) were in women and 10, 837 (39. 1 %) were in men. <b>Metal-backed</b> components were used in 16, 011 total knee arthroplasties (57. 7 %) and all-polyethylene in 11, 722 total knee arthroplasties (42. 3 %). With revision for any reason as the end point, the all-polyethylene tibial component had slightly superior, unadjusted ten-year survival compared with the <b>metal-backed</b> component: 97. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 96. 7 % to 97. 7 %) compared with 96. 6 % (95 % CI, 96. 2 % to 96. 9 %; p = 0. 002). Cox multiple regression analysis adjusting for age group, sex, and patellar resurfacing showed that all-polyethylene components had a reduced risk of revision for any reason (relative risk = 0. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 64 to 0. 89) and a reduced risk of revision due to infection (relative risk = 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 46 to 0. 86). Patellar resurfacing and male sex increased the risk of revision due to infection (relative risk = 2. 22 [95 % CI, 1. 37 to 3. 62] and 2. 21 [95 % CI, 1. 66 to 2. 94], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These all-polyethylene tibial components were at least as good as or superior to <b>metal-backed</b> tibial components with respect to implant survivorship at ten years in cruciate-retaining total knee replacements. We concluded that these less expensive all-polyethylene tibial components can be safely and effectively used in total knee arthroplasty. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

40|$|Background: The cost of {{the implant}} {{as part of a}} total knee {{arthroplasty}} accounts for {{a substantial portion of the}} costs for the overall procedure: all-polyethylene tibial components cost considerably less than cemented <b>metal-backed</b> tibial components. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine whether the clinical results of lower-cost all-polyethylene tibial components were comparable with the results of a more expensive <b>metal-backed</b> tibial component. Methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, the bibliographies of identified articles, orthopaedicmeeting abstracts, health technology assessmentweb sites, and important orthopaedic journals. This searchwas performed for the years 1990 to the present. No language restriction was applied. We restricted our search to Level-I studies involving participants who received either an all-polyethylene or a <b>metal-backed</b> tibial implant. The primary outcomemeasures were durability, function, and adverse events. Two reviewers independently screened the papers for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Effects estimates were pooled with use of fixed and random-effects models of risk ratios, calculated with 95 % confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistic. Forest plots were also generated. Results: Data on 1798 primary total knee implants from twelve studies were analyzed. In all studies, themedian or mean age of the participants was greater than sixty-seven years, with a majority of the patients being female.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} 34 total hip arthroplasties (THA) for avascular necrosis of the femoral head in 26 {{patients who}} were younger than 40 years {{at the time of}} the index operation. The average age at the time of THA was 28. 3 (17 - 38) years. The mean follow-up was 10. 9 (5 - 19) years. We used 6 cemented and 28 cementless acetabular components and a cemented polished tapered stem in all hips. The mean Charnley modified Merle d’ Aubigné Postel score was 8. 9 points pre - operatively and 16. 6 points at final follow-up. Two cemented <b>metal-backed</b> cups were revised because of aseptic loosening at 10 years, one cemented polyethylene cup failed at 12 years and 2 more all polyethylene cups had pending failure. The <b>metal-backed</b> cemented cups and the all polyethylene cups had a longer follow-up than the uncemented cups. Therefore and because of the proven unfavourable long term outcome of the cemented <b>metal-backed</b> ExeterTM cup we are not able to draw any firm conclusions regarding the preferred choice between cemented and uncemented cups in this particular group of patients. On the femoral site none of the stems had to be revised.

40|$|Purpose Most total knee {{arthroplasty}} tibial {{components are}} <b>metal-backed,</b> but an alternative tibial component made entirely of polyethylene (all-polyethylene design) exists. While several clinical {{studies have shown}} that all-poly design performs similarly to the <b>metal-backed,</b> the objective {{of this study is to}} perform a biomechanical comparison. Methods Loads, constraints and geometries during a squat activity at 120 ° of flexion were obtained from a validated musculoskeletal model and applied to a finite element model. Stresses in the tibia and micromotions at the bone–implant interface were evaluated for several implant configurations: (1) three different thicknesses of the cement penetration under the baseplate (2, 3 and 4 mm), (2) the presence or absence of a cement layer around the stem of the tibial tray and (3) three different bone conditions (physiological, osteopenic and osteoporotic bone). Results All-polyethylene tibial components resulted in significantly higher (p < 0. 001) and more uneven stress distributions in the cancellous bone under the baseplate (peak difference: + 128. 4 %) and fivefold increased micromotions (p < 0. 001). Performance of both implant designs worsened with poorer bone quality with peaks in stress and micromotion variations of + 40. 8 and + 54. 0 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). Performance improvements when the stem was cemented were not statistically significant (n. s.). Conclusion The <b>metal-backed</b> design showed better biomechanical performance during a squat activity at 120 ° of flexion compared to the all-polyethylene design. These results should be considered when selecting the appropriate tibial component for a patient, especially in the presence of osteoporotic bone or if intense physical activity is foreseen. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{regarding}} the risk of incomplete seating of <b>metal-backed</b> ceramic liners in the Trident® acetabular system. This prompted us to audit our series of primary and revision THAs. We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients (78 arthroplasties, 55 of which were primary and 23 revisions) using the Trident® acetabular system between 2003 and 2007. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were reviewed independently by two specialist registrars and one consultant surgeon to look for incomplete seating. Six liners were seated incompletely, representing 8 % overall. All unseated liners were in the primary group, representing 10 % risk in this group, compared with 0 % risk in the revision group. The incidence of malseating in our primary arthroplasty group {{was similar to the}} published incidence (16. 4 %). We encountered no problems in patients having a revision.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a dense array of metallic circular patches printed on a electrically thin <b>metal-backed</b> dielectric substrate. Since the sub-wavelength dimensions, the array and the <b>metal-backed</b> substrate {{can be described}} in terms of a lumped capacitance and a lumped inductance, respectively. Around the resonant frequency, the structure, known as high-impedance surface, reflects totally an incident electromagnetic wave with zero shift in phase. Due to this property, it is widely employed in antenna systems as compact back reflector with improved performances with respect to typical metal reflector. Starting from the concept of the grid capacitive reactance of a planar array of squared patches and its related formulas, we investigate on the field distribution on the array plane and properly modify the formulas for the case of the circular patches. We present two new analytical formulas which can be effectively used for the fast design of 2 D-isotropic circular HISs.

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} {{can assist}} in the detection of periprosthetic osteolysis, {{but it has not}} been used to measure the actual volume of bone defects adjacent to hip replacement components because of the scanning artifact caused by metal. The aim of the current study was to develop a spiral computed tomography technique that provides precise and reliable volumetric measurement of bone defects adjacent to uncemented <b>metal-backed</b> acetabular components. Computed tomography scans were taken of small and large defects of known volume created in the ilium in a bovine hemipelvis and a pelvis from a cadaver. Scans were analyzed by two independent observers. The computed tomography operating conditions were determined that enabled volumetric measurements and that were accurate to within 96 % for small and large defects and precise to greater than 98 % for small and large defects. This computed tomography technique has the capability to measure accurately and precisely the volume of bone defects in the ilium adjacent to <b>metal-backed</b> acetabular components. This technique has clear advantages over plain radiographs. It will allow investigation of the natural history of osteolytic lesions, enhance preoperative planning, and improve monitoring of the outcomes of treatments of osteolysis.

But to our knowledge, a survivorship comparison of all-polyethylene and <b>metal-backed</b> tibial components in posterior cruciate ligament-substituting total knee arthroplasty (PS-TKA) has not been studied in China previously. Using survivorship analysis, we have studied the midterm outcome of 34 cemented PS-TKA using an all-polyethylene tibial component and of 34 cemented PS-TKA using a <b>metal-backed</b> tibial component which has an identical articular surface with all-polyethylene tibial components. All operations were performed by {{the same group of}} surgeons; 58 patients underwent a unilateral operation and five patients a bilateral operation.

40|$|Abstract—A free-space, {{non-destructive}} {{method for}} measuring the complex permittivity of a double-layer bulk dielectrics and thin film oxide layers at microwave frequencies have been developed. The method utilizes a spot-focusing antenna system {{in conjunction with a}} vector network analyzer in the range of 18 – 26 GHz. The bulk dielectric was measured using the Transmission Method and <b>Metal-Backed</b> Method, while the <b>Metal-Backed</b> Method was used to investigate the thin films. Both types of samples were sandwiched between two quarter-wavelength Teflon plates to improve the mismatch at the frequencies of measurement. The thin film sample arrangement was backed by an additional metal plate. The double-layer bulk dielectric samples were Teflon-PVC and Plexiglas-PVC, while the thin film samples consisted of SiO 2 layers of different thicknesses grown on doped and undoped Si wafer substrates. The relative permittivity obtained for PVC ranged between 2. 62 to 2. 93, while those for Plexiglas exhibited values between 2. 45 to 2. 63. The relative permittivity of SiO 2 deposited on these wafers was between 3. 5 to 4. 5. All these values are in good agreement with published data. The advantage of the method is its ability to measure the dielectric properties of the films at the midfrequency band irrespective of the substrate type used.

In all, 36 knees were followed over 20 years with a survival of the tibial and femoral components together of 97. 8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 9851 to 0. 9677), with no implants being revised for polyethylene wear or osteolysis. Age> 70 was associated with increased survival (99. 6 %, 95 % CI 99. 0 to 99. 8) (p < 0. 0001) but pre-operative valgus alignment reduced survival (95. 1 %, 95 % CI 90. 0 to 97. 6) (p = 0. 0056).

After eight years he developed increasing hip pain and shortening ofthe leg. There was radiological evidence of loosening of the femoral component with acetabula...|$|E
40|$|Absorption {{enhancement}} in thin <b>metal-backed</b> {{solar cells}} caused by dipole scatterers {{embedded in the}} absorbing layer is studied using a semi-analytical approach. The method accounts {{for changes in the}} radiation rate produced by layers above and below the dipole, and treats incoherently the subsequent scattering of light in guided modes from other dipoles. We find large absorption enhancements for strongly coupled dipoles, exceeding the ergodic limit in some configurations involving lossless dipoles. An antireflection-coated 100 -nm layer of a- Si:H on Ag absorbs up to 87 % of incident above-gap light. Thin layers of both strong and weak absorbers show similar strongly enhanced absorption...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} compact, {{wideband}} terahertz and infrared absorber, comprising a patterned graphene sheet on a thin <b>metal-backed</b> dielectric slab. This graphene-based nanostructure can achieve a low or negative effective permeability, necessary for realizing the perfect absorption. The dual-reactive property found {{in both the}} plasmonic graphene sheet and the grounded highpermittivity slab introduces extra poles into the equivalent circuit model of the system, thereby resulting in a dual-band or broadband magnetic resonance that enhances the absorption bandwidth. More interestingly, the two-dimensional patterned graphene sheet significantly simplifies the design and fabrication processes for achieving resonant magnetic response, and allows the frequency-reconfigurable operation via electrostatic gating...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{evaluated}} {{the rates of}} volumetric wear and the patterns of wear of 128 acetabular com-ponents retrieved during an autopsy or a revision oper-ation between one and twenty-one years after total hip arthroplasty. Twenty-two all-polyethylene components were retrieved at autopsy from hips that had been func-tioning well {{at the time of}} death (Group A). The re-maining 106 components — eighty-four all-polyethylene components (Group B) and twenty-two <b>metal-backed</b> components (Group C) — were retrieved during revi-sion operations. All 128 components had been inserted with cement. The mean rate of volumetric wear, determined di-rectly with a fluid-displacement method, was thirty-five cubic millimeters per year (range, eight to 11...|$|E
