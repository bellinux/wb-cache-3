5000|$|On 13 March (O.S.28 February), at {{five in the}} morning, the Tsar left Mogilev, (and {{directed}} also <b>Nikolay</b> Iudovich <b>Ivanov</b> to go to Tsarskoe Selo) but {{was unable}} to reach Petrograd as revolutionaries meanwhile controlled railway stations around the capital. Around midnight the train was stopped at Malaya Vishera, turned, and in the evening of 14 March Nicholas arrived in Pskov. In the meantime the units guarding the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo either [...] "declared their neutrality" [...] or left for Petrograd and thus abandoned the imperial family. The Provisional Committee declared itself the governing body of Russian Empire. Wednesday,14 March (O.S 1 March,) was the worst day, according to Albert Stopford.|$|R

5000|$|On February 22 {{the workers}} {{of most of}} the big {{factories}} were on strike. On International Women's Day, [...] working women came out in the streets to demonstrate against starvation, war and tsardom. During a session of the Council of Ministers on 25 February 1917, Pokrovsky proposed the resignation of the whole government. On the 26th Protopopov, and Commander of the Petrogradsky Military District <b>Nikolay</b> Iudovich <b>Ivanov</b> tried to suppress the February Revolution. However, Protopopov ignored warnings from the Tsar's secret police, the Okhrana, that the ill-disciplined and poorly trained troops of the Petrograd garrison were unreliable. The reservist battalions of four regiments of the Imperial Guard then mutinied and joined the revolutionaries. Pokrovsky reported about his negotiations with the Progressive Bloc (led by Vasili Maklakov) at the session of the Council of Ministers in the Mariinsky Palace. The Bloc spoke for the resignation of the government. It seems Protopopov refused to give up. On the 27th the Duma was dissolved and Protopopov was proclaimed dictator. Not long after his apartment and office were sacked by demonstrators. Protopopov took refuge at the Marie Palace. According to M. Nelipa: [...] "On February 28, Protopopov freely walked into the Tauride Palace at 11.00 p.m. and handed himself in." [...] He was taken to the main hall, where the former cabinet ministers were surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets. The new Russian Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov requested him to retire from his post, giving the plea of 'illness' if he desired. Like Prince Golitsyn he was taken to the Peter and Paul fortress that night.|$|R
5000|$|The February Revolution {{began on}} the 22nd when the Tsar had left for the front, and strikes {{broke out in the}} Putilov workshops. On 23rd (International Women's Day), women in Saint Petersburg joined the strike, {{demanding}} woman suffrage, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of World War I. Although all gathering on the streets were absolutely forbidden, on February 25, some 250,000 people were on strike. The Tsar ordered Sergey Semyonovich Khabalov, an inexperienced and extremely indecisive commander of the Petrograd military district (and <b>Nikolay</b> Iudovich <b>Ivanov)</b> to suppress the rioting by force. On the 27th the Duma delegates received an order from his Majesty that he had decided to prorogue the Duma until April, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The Duma refused to obey, and gathered in a private meeting. According to Buchanan: [...] "It was an act of madness to proroque the Duma at a moment like the present. The delegates decided to form a Provisional Committee of the State Duma. The Provisional Committee ordered the arrest of all the ex-ministers and senior officials." [...] The Tauride Palace was occupied by the crowd and soldiers. [...] "On the evening the Council of Ministers of Russia held its last meeting in the Marinsky Palace and formally submitted its resignation to the Tsar when they were cut off from the telephone. Soon a group of Duma members formed the Provisional Committee. Guchkov, along with Vasily Shulgin, came to the army headquarters near Pskov to persuade the Tsar to abdicate. The committee sent commissars to take over ministries and other government institutions, dismissing Tsar-appointed ministers and formed the Provisional Government under Georgi Lvov. [...] In the seventeen months of the [...] "Tsarina's rule", from September 1915 to February 1917, Russia had four Prime Ministers, five Ministers of the Interior, three Foreign Ministers, three War Ministers, three Ministers of Transport and four Ministers of Agriculture. This [...] "ministerial leapfrog", as it came to be known, not only removed competent men from power, but also disorganized the work of government since no one remained long enough in office to master their responsibilities. [...] On 2 March 1917 the Provisional government decided that the Duma will not be reconvened. Formally, the Duma existed until October 6, 1917, when it was disbanded by the Provisional government in connection with the preparation of the elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly.|$|R

"The teachet of Russian language" [...] and the Japanese {{connoisseur}} of the Russian language.During {{the cargo}} operations in Japan, some crew {{members of the}} ship Matallurg Anosov were taken for tour in Kyoto, old capital of Japan. The tour guide was Mr. M. Hamano, a Japanese. Mr. Hamano had very good knowledges in Russian language and wished to improve it. It is why he often asked a seaman of the ship about correct and proper pronunciation and understanding some of the words. Soon he stopped to ask questions to the seaman and commenced to ask to Nikolay. When the ship back in Odessa, Nicholas {{received a letter from}} Mr. Hamano and told his son: [...] "The Janapese had very good knowladges in Russian language and he was a professor of Russian language in a University. He ask me a question about the correct pronunciation and the use of Russian words. I was puzzled often due to his knowledges in Russian had sometimes better then my knowledges in Russian language includes Ukrainian words and Ukrainian pronunciation. I am Ukranian. I understood that another seaman redirected Mr. Hamano to me and asked that seaman after the tour. he is tired of questions from the Japanese and said to <b>Mr.</b> Hamano that <b>Nikolay</b> is a teacher of Russian language. It is why Nikolay was interviewed with the addiction regarding Russian language and was forced to give his address for correspondence letters." ...|$|R
