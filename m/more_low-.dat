40|$|The {{importance}} of HLA donor-recipient matching in unrelated haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) {{is the subject}} of debate. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 805 adult patients from the Italian Registry receiving HSCT for a haematological malignancy from January 1999 to June 2006 and correlated the degree of HLA matching with transplant outcome. All patient-donor pairs had high-resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB 1 and -DQB 1. There was a significantly higher risk of overall mortality, non-relapse mortality, graft failure and acute GVHD (aGVHD) for patients receiving HSCT from an unrelated donor with one or <b>more</b> <b>low-</b> or high-resolution mismatch/es (Mm/s). When only a single HLA Mm is present (9 / 10 matched pairs), mortality risk is higher than among 10 / 10 matched pairs in patients transplanted with acute leukaemia in the first CR ('early' patients) but not in the other patients (advanced patients) : HR = 1. 69, 95 % CI = 0. 94 - 3. 02, P = 0. 08; HR = 1. 03, 95 % CI = 0. 80 - 1. 32, P = 0. 82, for early and advanced patients, respectively.

The current study aimed to investigate the pure prognostic role of EGFR mutations in treatment-naïve patients with resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed 373 patients with stage I pulmonary non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent complete surgical resection between January 2010 and May 2014. The tumors were classified according to IASLC/ATS/ERS criteria. EGFR mutation status was determined by established methods. A total of 120 patients were included for analysis; 87 had tumors with EGFR mutations and 33 had wild-type tumors. <b>More</b> <b>low-</b> and intermediate-grade tumors had EGFR mutations, and {{nearly half of the}} high-grade tumors were wild-type (75. 7 % versus 46. 2 %, p = 0. 041).

Tumor recurrence was 41. 4 % and 30. 3 % in mutant and wild-type patients. The 5 -years survival rate was 54 % and 71. 2 %. Multivariate analysis revealed that the new histological classification and the pathologic stage were independent predictors of both DFS and OS. EGFR mutation status had no prognostic implications.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between treatment intensity and level of risk in routine hospital care of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and to identify independent predictors of use or omission for each of eight evidence-based treatments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of patients fulfilling case definition for ACS in whom absolute risk of adverse outcomes was quantified (as low, moderate, or high risk) using formal prediction rules, and for whom treatment eligibility was determined using expert-agreed criteria. Participants and setting: 3912 consecutive or randomly selected patients admitted to 21 hospitals in Queensland, Australia between 1 August 2001 and 31 December 2005. Results: The proportions of eligible patients receiving treatment varied inversely with risk level in regard to reperfusion therapies of fibrinolytic therapy or primary angioplasty (low risk, 88. 3 %; moderate risk, 61. 9 %; high risk, 18. 2 %; P < 0. 001), heparin (91. 4 %; 83. 7 %; 72. 8 %; P < 0. 001) and early invasive intervention (33. 6 %; 24. 0 %; 18. 5 %; P < 0. 001). Significantly <b>more</b> <b>low-</b> and moderate- than high-risk patients received beta-blockers (87. 0 %; 88. 5 %; 79. 1 %; P < 0. 001), lipid-lowering agents (87. 3 %; 84. 8 %; 65. 8 %; P < 0. 001), and referral to cardiac rehabilitation (51. 8 %; 46. 0 %; 34. 4 %; P < 0. 001) at discharge. The most frequent independent predictors of treatment omission in all patients included increasing age (5 of 8 treatments), previous ACS or atrial tachyarrhythmias (4 of 8), and past history of cerebrovascular accident or congestive heart failure (3 of 8). Conclusion: In routine care of ACS, eligible patients at high risk receive treatment less frequently than those at low and moderate risk. Reforms in professional education, routine use of risk stratification tools, guideline recommendations tailored to population-specific reductions in absolute risk, and better hospital networking with standardised triage and referral procedures for invasive procedures may help reduce selection bias {{in the delivery of}} indicated care...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters. In the first chapter, I explain changes in the life-cycle earnings profile for different birth cohorts. The second chapter assesses the quantitative importance of federal aid for college education in explaining college premium. In the first chapter, I document the life-cycle earnings profile for the 25 -year- old college- and high school-educated white men in 1940, 1950, 1960 and 1970. I find that later cohorts have flatter average life-cycle earnings profile. Using {{a version of the}} Ben-Porath model, I propose an explanation based on the composition effect. In my model, all individuals have a high school diploma and are differentiated by their ability. They must decide whether to work or go to a four-year college. There is a threshold ability above which individuals choose to attend college and below which they work. All cohorts face the same ability distribution and an exogenous sequence of wage rate per unit of human capital that grows at a constant rate. A higher initial level of wage rate increases college attainment implying that the average ability is lower for both college- and high school-educated individuals. From the Ben- Porath model, lower ability individuals have less steep increment in their earnings. This implies that the average college (and high school) life-cycle earnings profile for the 1970 cohort will be flatter than that of the 1940 cohort. My model is able to quantitatively explain 67 and 35 percent of the flattening in the average life-cycle earnings profile for college and high school-educated individuals, respectively. Since the late 1970 s, there has been a strong increase in the college premium. While most papers focus on skill-biased technical change, the second chapter explores the role of federal aid as a possible source of inequality. I build a model where all individuals have a high-school diploma but are heterogeneous with respect to their innate abilities and initial human capital. They decide whether to attend college to accumulate more human capital before working, or to start working right away. The production function for human capital in college requires two inputs: human capital and goods. In this context, two mechanisms are key for the behavior of the college premium. First, federal aid makes it easier to afford the goods input in the human capital technology. This induces college students to accumulate more human capital and consequently, they have higher earnings. Second, as more individuals attend college due to rising income, the composition of college graduates changes: <b>more</b> <b>low-</b> ability individuals attend college, implying a decrease in average college earnings. A calibrated version of the model accounts fully for the rise in the college premium. Federal aid alone accounts for about 70 percent of the rise...|$|E

40|$|Because {{incubation}} by birds is energetically costly, parents frequently {{trade off}} investment in incubation against self-maintenance. This can be manifested by {{a reduction in}} incubation temperature, which comes at high somatic costs for nestlings. The {{extent to which these}} costs constrain fitness is poorly understood.

Fledglings from the coldest treatment (35. 0 °C) survived less well than other fledglings, but the proportion of winter and breeding survivors did not differ significantly between treatments. However, survival probability in both seasons increased with body mass at fledging in birds from low and mid incubation temperatures, but decreased with fledging body mass in the high-temperature treatment. Mid-temperature nestlings were heavier as adults, weighing 7 % <b>more</b> than <b>low-</b> and high-temperature survivors.

In this literature review, we discuss {{the relative importance of}} fire versus canopy gaps as agents of disturbance affecting the structure and dynamics of unmanaged coastal forests in British Columbia. Our analyses focus on the province’s wet coastal temperate rain forests, specifically the Hypermaritime and Very Wet Maritime Coastal Western Hemlock (CWHvh and CWHvm) subzones, and the Wet Hypermaritime and Moist Maritime Mountain Hemlock (MHwh and MHmm) subzones. After reviewing the relationships between disturbance events, disturbance regimes, and stand dynamics, we critically assess the traditional classification of fire regimes in the wet coastal temperate rain forests, in part by differentiating between fire occurrence and mean return intervals. We provide four lines of evidence to reject the traditional view that stand-initiating fire at intervals of 250 – 350 years was {{the dominant}} disturbance regime in the wet coastal temperate rain forests of British Columbia.

An adjusted-interrupted time series (difference-in-difference) model is estimated with a comprehensive dataset for Seattle, WA (1987 - 97). Contrary to NIMBY expectations, the predominant impact is an upgrading effect of lower-value areas. However, spillover effects are very sensitive to how data are pooled across space: The citywide upgrading effects are driven by poorer pockets adjacent to affluent areas with no or small effects in <b>more</b> diverse <b>low-</b> and medium income areas. They only occur in single-family, not multi-family zones. The only negative effects were associated with vouchers in one of the affluent areas. Impacts of unsubsidized rentals are very similar to those of subsidized ones, suggesting an independent effect beyond subsidy status. These findings are explained with Seattle's dispersion and good neighbor policies, with gentrification pressures as a possible alternative explanation. Site visits confirmed the location of subsidized sites in lower-value areas and the higher maintenance quality of subsidized vis-Ã -vis unsubsidized units. ...|$|R

40|$|Point- contact Andreev- {{reflection}} spectroscopy (PCARS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} direct techniques to study the number, amplitude, and symmetry (in the k space) of the energy gap(s) in superconductors. In the past 15 years, it has turned out to be a powerful and versatile alternative to more demanding and expensive techniques, for example scanning tunnel spectroscopy, for the study of unconventional multiband superconductors. Indeed, when high- quality single crystals are available, and if suitable models are used to analyze the data, PCARS can provide information on the detailed structure of the gap and on the shape of the Fermi surface. In short, PCARS consists in measuring the differential conductance of a contact between a normal metal and a superconductor, that must be ballistic to ensure a good energy resolution. In practice, point contacts are usually mesoscopic, as is the region of the superconductor probed by PCARS, because of the constraints posed by the electronic mean free path and the coherence length. However, PCARS has been seldom used to investigate "small" or <b>more</b> generally <b>low-</b> dimensional systems.

The present study was a door-to-door cold-calling survey in {{urban and rural areas}} in and around Bangalore, Karnataka State. From 2, 714 households contacted, 2, 514 biologically unrelated individuals were eligible for the survey and 2, 329 (92. 9 %) participated (1, 103 [48 %] rural; 1, 226 [52 %] urban; 1, 141 [49 %] male; 1, 188 [51 %] female; mean age 38. 0 years). The focus was on primary headache (migraine and tension-type headache [TTH]) and medication-overuse headache. A structured questionnaire administered b...|$|R

With auditory stimuli, this improvement was often {{found to be}} asymmetric, being greater on current low-intensity trials. Our study investigated (1) whether asymmetric sequential intensity adaptation also occurs with visual stimuli; (2) whether these adjustments reflect decision-criterion shifts or, rather, a modulation of perceptual sensitivity; and (3) how sequential intensity adaptation and its underlying mechanisms are affected by mental fatigue induced through prolonged performance. In a continuous speeded detection task with randomly alternating high- and low-intensity visual stimuli, the reaction-time benefit after low-intensity trials was greater on subsequent low- than high-intensity trials. This asymmetry, however, only developed with time on task (TOT). Signal-detection analyses showed that the decision criterion transiently became more liberal after a low-intensity trial, whereas observer sensitivity increased when the preceding and current stimulus were of equal intensity. TOT-induced mental fatigue only affected sensitivity, which dropped <b>more</b> on <b>low-</b> than on high-intensity trials. This differential fatigue-related sensitivity decrease selectively enhanced the impact of criterion down-shifts on low-intensity trials, revealing how the interplay of two perceptual mechanisms and their modulation by fatigue combine to produce the observed overall pattern of asymmetric performance adjustments to varying visual intensity in continuous speeded detection. Our results have implications for similar patterns of sequential demand adaptation in other cognitive domains {{as well as for}} real-world prolonged detection performance...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of targeted preschool, which limits participation to children from low-income families or children with other risk factors, universal public preschool is needed for multiple reasons. Barnett (2010) summarizes the argument for a policy shift in the United States from targeted to universal public preschool as follows: (1) the stigma associated with “programs for the poor” may reduce participation, (2) as family incomes and income criteria both change in an uncertain economy, families in the income margins may lose access and cannot predict their future eligibility, (3) peer effects on learning may be greater under universal public preschool because of more heterogeneous classrooms (Mashburn et al. 2009) and teacher expectations may be greater in heterogeneous classrooms, (4) political support for preschool may increase when more higher-income families are advocating {{to improve the quality}} of their children’s public preschool education, (5) significantly <b>more</b> children from <b>low-</b> and moderate-income families will enroll, and (6) societal economic return is likely to be greater than additional costs.|$|R
3000|$|Frequent use {{of three}} of the six {{instructional}} modes that aim at developing computational skills were found to be positively associated with the mean mathematics score of schools in all three groups of countries, although in varying strength. For two modes, [...] "memorizing formulas and procedures" [...] and [...] "practicing the four arithmetical operations without using a calculator," [...] this association is <b>more</b> profound in <b>low-</b> and medium-achieving countries, while {{in the case of the}} third variable, [...] "writing equations and functions to represent relationships," [...] the association is more profound in high- and medium-achieving countries. A one-unit increase on the frequency scale of these variables results in an increase of about 0.15 to 0.4 standard deviations of the distribution of schools' mean scores in the different groups of countries. Frequent use of other instructional modes of this type ("working on fractions and decimals," [...] [...] "interpreting data in tables, charts and graphs") were found to be negatively associated with achievement in low-performing countries.|$|R
