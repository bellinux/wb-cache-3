40|$|Myrtus Communis L. (Myrtaceae family), {{commonly}} known as myrtle, possesses a set of qualities that make it very interesting for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic industries. In this work, myrtle was studied {{over a period of}} three years (2006 - 2008), encompassing the main stages of the development cycle of the plant. The influence of climatic conditions, such as temperature and rainfall, on the chemical composition and yield of the essential oils obtained from leaves and berries was studied. The leaves and berries essential oils were obtained by Clevenger distillation and analysed by GC and GC-MS. The results show that the major components were limonene+ 1, 8 -cineole, <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> α-pinene and linalool. Over the three year period of study, a decrease in the composition of the most volatile compounds (α-pinene and limonene+ 1, 8 -cineole) was observed, the reverse being found for linalool and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The highest value for the yield of the leaves’ essential oils was observed in the third year (0. 64...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and antimutagenic {{properties of the}} essential oil of myrtle (Myrtus communis L.). Plant samples were collected from the two distant localities (southernmost and northern point) of the Montenegro coastline. Chemical profiles of the two samples were evaluated by GC-MS. In both of the samples monoterpenes {{were found to be}} the predominant compounds. Among them a-pinene, linalool, 1, 8 -cineole, and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were the major compounds. Significant differences between the samples were found in the ranges of a-pinene (14. 7 %– 35. 9 %) and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (5. 4 %– 21. 6 %). Both oils exhibited moderate DPPH scavenging activity, with IC 50 values of 6. 24 mg/mL and 5. 99 mg/mL. The antimutagenic properties were assayed against spontaneous and t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli oxyR mutant IC 202, a bacterial strain deficient in removing ROS. Reduction of the spontaneous mutagenesis in presence of myrtle EO was only slight, up to 13 % at the highest concentration tested. When the oxidative mutagen was used, EO expressed higher reduction of mutagenesis, in a concentration dependent manner, with statistical significance for effect at the highest concentration tested (28 %). Suppression of t-BOOH induced mutagenesis was correlated with the observed scavenging activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oil of Portuguese myrtle was determined at different developmental stages of the plant: pre-flowering, flowering, unripe and ripe berries. The oil was extracted separately by Clevenger distillation from leaves, branches and berries. The yields vary from 0. 33 % to 0. 74 % for leaves, 0. 02 % to 0. 19 % for branches, and 0. 11 % to 0. 23 % for berries. The highest yields were obtained for the leaves in October, and for the berries in September; branches show similar values in the months of June, July and September, and the samples collected in May and October produced very little amount of oil. Altogether, September {{seems to be the}} month with the best yields for the three parts of the plant. The essential oils were analyzed by GC and GC/MS, and a total of thirty five components were identified. The major components were limonene+ 1, 8 -cineole [25. 9 % (berries) – 39. 5 % (leaves) ], <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> [6. 6 % (berries) – 24. 8 % (leaves) ], α-pinene [9. 7 % (berries) – 21. 5 % (leaves) ], and linalool [6. 2 % (leaves) – 36. 5 % (berries) ].

40|$|The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} {{to evaluate the}} genotoxic potential of flavouring substances from subgroup 2. 2 of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 208 Revision 2 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). In FGE. 208 Rev 1, the CEF Panel evaluated genotoxicity studies on p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117], the representative substance for FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2. The Comet assay performed in liver showed a positive result, and therefore, the Panel concluded that p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is genotoxic in vivo and that, accordingly, there is a safety concern for its use as flavouring substance. Since p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is representative for the nine remaining substances of subgroup 2. 2 (p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], 2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 272], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278], <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> [FL-no: 09. 302], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]), the Panel concluded in the previous revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 1) {{that there is a}} potential safety concern for these substances. Subsequently, the industry has submitted genotoxicity studies on five substances of FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2 : p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278] and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> [FL-no: 09. 302], which are evaluated in the present revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). The Panel concluded that the concern for genotoxicity could be ruled out for p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FLno: 09. 278] and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> [FL-no: 09. 302], which will be evaluated through the Procedure.

A simple and rapid liquid-liquid extraction method was used to isolate volatile compounds from myrtle alcoholic extracts followed by GC and GC-MS analysis allowing the detection of 24 compounds. The volatile fraction was characterized by the terpenes fraction corresponding {{to that of the}} essential oils and by a fatty acid ethyl esters fraction. The variation during extraction of the volatile fraction in alcoholic extracts of berries and leaves was evaluated.

The molecular mechanisms by which fruit flavor and aroma compounds are gained and lost during evolution and domestication are largely unknown. Here, we report on processes {{that may have been}} responsible for the evolution of diversity in strawberry (Fragaria spp) fruit flavor components. Whereas the terpenoid profile of cultivated strawberry species is dominated by the monoterpene linalool and the sesquiterpene nerolidol, fruit of wild strawberry species emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes and <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> which are not found in the cultivated species. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify the F. ananassa Nerolidol Synthase 1 (FaNES 1) gene in cultivated strawberry and showed that the recombinant FaNES 1 enzyme produced in Escherichia coli cells is capable of generating both linalool and nerolidol when supplied with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively. Characterization of additional genes that are very similar to FaNES 1 from both the wild and cultivated strawberry species (FaNES 2 and F. vesca NES 1) showed that only FaNES 1 is exclusively present and highly expressed in the fruit of cultivated (octaploid) varieties. It encodes a protein truncated at its N terminus. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments suggest that a change in subcellular localization led to the FaNES 1 enzyme encountering both GPP and FPP, allowing it to produce linalool and nerolidol.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate and characterise biologically active {{compounds}} from endemic Australian plants. A total of 6 novel, and 26 known compounds have been isolated throughout the course of this work. A comprehensive investigation of the GC-MS chemical profile of C. cunninghamii leaf essential oil found that thymol (1) cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (4), <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (2), myrtenol (3) and cis-chrsanthenol (5) were the major constituents. The essential oil and crude solvent extracts of C. cunninghamii possessed significant antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity. A 50 % aqueous ethanol extract was demonstrated to possess multiple modes of anti-inflammatory action. The crude extract was found to significantly inhibit both COX- 1 and COX- 2 cyclooxygenases and was comparable to the positive controls; Ibuprofen and Celebrex respectively. The crude extract also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in the nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) assays, but did not show inhibition in the lipoxygenase (LO) assay. A total of seventeen compounds, of which 10, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are novel, have been identified from the aqueous-ethanolic extract of C. cunninghamii. Five flavonoids; axillarin (16), isokaempferide (17), 4 ’, 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3, 6 -dimethoxyflavone (18), jaceidin (19), and 2 ’, 4 ’, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxy- 6 -methoxyflavone- 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (10) were isolated from the flowers of C. cunninghamii. A series of caffeic acids were isolated as the major component of the stems, these included; chlorogenic acid (12) and its methyl ester (13), caffeic acid ethyl ester (11), isochlorogenic acid A (14) macroantoin G (15) and the novel 4 ξ, 5 ξ-di-O-caffeoyl- 2, 6 ξ-dihydroxyhept- 2 -ene- 1, 7 - dioic acid (6) and its 1 -methyl ester (7), 7 -methyl ester (8) and 1, 7 -dimethylester (9) derivatives. Lastly, arnicolide C (20) a sesquiterpene lactone, 3 -hydroxykaura- 9 (11), 16 - diene- 18 -oic acid (21) and 8 -hydroxy- 9, 10 -diisobutyryloxythymol (23) were characterised by spectroscopic methods. All of the compounds were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity, as determined by the inhibition of prostaglandin E 2 in 3 T 3 fibroblast cells. All compounds, inhibited PGE 2 production to some extent, at a concentration of 31. 25 μg/mL. The flavonoids 10 and 16 - 19 were the most active compounds. The caffeic acids 6 - 9, 12 - 14 and the thymol derivative 23 also significantly inhibited PGE 2 production. The IC 50 values were determined for the novel compounds; 10, 6, 7, 8 and 9, as 1. 47, 2. 48, 4. 73, 5. 54 and 1. 26 μM, respectively. These novel compounds were more potent than the positive control, aspirin, which was found to inhibit PGE 2 production by 42 % at a concentration of 18 μM. Antioxidant activity, as determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) has also been attributed to both the flavonoids; 10, 16 - 19 and caffeic acid compounds; 6 - 9 and 12 - 14. The antioxidant capacity of these compounds was found to be comparable to epicatechin, a major antioxidant constituent of green tea. A detailed analysis of the wood, leaf, branch and root oil of E. mitchellii was carried out by a combination of GC-FID, GC-MS, LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The wood, root, leaf and branch oils were found to be predominantly composed of sesquiterpenes. The three major compounds identified in the leaf oil, which accounted for 44 % of the oil, were α-pinene (40), (+) spathulenol (15) and an unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol. The composition of the leaf oil was complex and chemically distinct from the wood and root oils, whereas the branch oil was found to exhibit a chemical composition that was intermediate between the leaf and the wood oil. After fractionation by preparative HPLC six components of the wood oil were characterized and accounted for 80 % of the oil. The major constituents of the wood oil were; eremophilone (30), 9 -hydroxy- 7 (11), 9 -eremophiladien- 8 -one (36), santalcamphor (35) and the novel 9 -hydroxy- 1, 7 (11), 9 -eremophilatrien- 8 -one (42). Two minor constituents, 8 -hydroxy- 10, 11 -eremophiladien- 9 -one (32) and 8 -hydroxy- 1, 11 - eremophiladien- 9 -one (33) were also isolated in this study. The two major constituents of the root oil of E. mitchellii were found to be eremophilone (30) and the zizaene, sesquithuriferone (43). These, together with the minor constituents 32, 33, 42, 35 and 36 accounted for 92 % of the root oil. The insecticidal properties of E. mitchellii were evaluated against several species of termites Nasutitermes walkeri (Hill), Nasutitermes exitiosus (Hill) and Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Bioassay-guided fractionation of E. mitchellii wood oil was undertaken to investigate the termiticidal metabolites. Of the major components, it has been determined that eremophilone (30) was the most active constituent of the wood oil followed by 8 -hydroxy- 1, 11 -eremophiladien- 9 -one (33), 9 -hydroxy- 7 (11), 9 - eremophiladien- 8 -one (36) and santalcamphor (35). The methanolic extracts from a total of 36 species have been evaluated for cytotoxicity against P 388 D 1 mouse lymphoblast cells. A collection of fifteen species of Eremophila from Western Australia and a further twenty from the Northern Territory were surveyed. Cytotoxicity was found to be largely non-selective across a range of human cancer cell lines, including MCF 7 (mammary adenocarcinoma), Hep G 2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), A 2780 (ovarian carcinoma), A- 375 (malignant melanoma) and PC- 3 (prostate cancer). Fractionation of the leaf material of E. racemosa afforded the six major metabolites. Isolation and structural elucidation of these polar compounds revealed the cyanogenetic glycoside prunasin (65), the flavonoid luteolin (74), the furofuran lignans, phillygenin (75), its 4 -O-β-D-glucoside phillyrin (76), pinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (77) and epipinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (78). Fractionation of the leaf material of E. maculata var. brevifolia afforded piceine (81) and epipinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (78).
