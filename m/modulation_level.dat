50|$|Loudness wars {{have caused}} a general fall in audio quality, {{initially}} on radio stations and more recently on CDs. As radio stations competed for attention and to raise the listener scores their ad revenue is based on, they used audio compression to give their sound more impact. They used level compressors, and in particular multi-band compressors that compress different frequencies independently. Such compressors usually incorporate fast acting limiters to eliminate brief peaks, since brief peaks, though they may not contribute much to perceived loudness, limit the <b>modulation</b> <b>level</b> {{that can be applied}} to FM transmissions in particular, if serious clipping and distortion are to be avoided. Digital broadcasting has changed all this: stations are no longer found by tuning across the band, so the loudest stations no longer stand out. Low noise level is also guaranteed regardless of signal level, so that it is no longer necessary to fully modulate to ensure acceptable clarity in poor reception areas. Many professionals feel that the more widespread adoption and understanding of alignment level throughout the audio industry could help bring modulation levels down, leaving headroom to cope with brief peaks, and using a different form of level compression that reduces dynamic range on programmes where this is considered desirable, but does not remove the brief peaks which add 'sparkle' and contribute to clearer sound. CDs in particular have suffered a loss of quality since they were introduced through the widespread use of fast limiting, which, given their very low noise level is quite unnecessary.|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{existing}} hardware implementations involving QAM modulation/demodulation follow a sequential approach and simply consider the QAM as an individual module. There has been limited design exploration, and most works allow limited reconfiguration, offering inadequate data rates when using low <b>modulation</b> <b>levels</b> [2 – 5]. The latter has been addressed through emerging SDR implementations mapped on MPSoCs, that also treat the QAM modulation as an individual system task, integrated {{as part of the}} system, rather than focusing on optimizing the performance of the modulator [6, 7]. Works in [2, 3] use a specific modulation type; they can, however, be extended to use higher <b>modulation</b> <b>levels</b> in order to increase the resulting data rate. Higher <b>modulation</b> <b>levels,</b> though, involve more divisions of both amplitude and phase and can potentially introduce decoding errors at the receiver, as the symbols are very close together (for a given transmission power level) and one level of amplitude may be confused (due to the effect of noise) with a higher level, thus, distorting the received signal [8]. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to allow for wide margins, and this can be done by increasing the available amplitude range through power amplification of the RF signal at the transmitter (to effectively spread the symbols out more); otherwise, data bits may be decoded incorrectly at the receiver, resulting in increased bit error rate (BER) [1, 8]. However, increasing the amplitude range will operate the RF amplifiers well within their nonlinear (compression) region causing distortion. Alternative QAM implementations try to avoid the use of multipliers and sine/cosine memories, by using the CORDIC algorithm [4, 5], however, still follow a sequential approach.|$|R

Consequently, the proposed TH method employing larger <b>modulation</b> <b>level</b> can carry more information bits in a symbol duration and then improve the system throughput. At the transmitter of the proposed TH/DS system, the TH-coded symbol sequence of each user is first generated according to the specific TH code (hopping pattern) and becomes as the input of N-ary BPPM modulator which also applies specific DS code to randomize the polarity of the modulated pulses.

The majority of existing QAM implementations follow a sequential implementation approach and rely on high <b>modulation</b> <b>levels</b> {{in order to meet}} the emerging high data rate constraints [1 – 5].

The vast majority of the research in digital cooperative relaying assumes the <b>modulation</b> <b>level</b> used by both the source and relay to be the same.

Furthermore, a parallel modulation architecture can benefit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where information is sent and received over two or more antennas often shared among many users [9, 10]. Using multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver offers significant capacity enhancement on many modern applications, including IEEE 802.11 n, 3 GPP LTE, and mobile WiMAX systems, providing increased throughput at the same channel bandwidth and transmit power [9, 10]. In order to achieve the benefit of MIMO systems, appropriate design aspects on the modulation and demodulation architectures have to be taken into consideration. It is obvious that transmitter architectures with multiple output ports, and the more complicated receiver architectures with multiple input ports, are mainly required. However, the demodulation architecture {{is beyond the scope of}} this work and is part of future work.|$|R
