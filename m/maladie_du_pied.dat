40|$|Modern {{healthcare}} professionals have {{to resolve the}} information paradox; they are overwhelmed with information but cannot find particular information when and where they need it. 1 The internet and its associated technologies, especially the world wide web, {{have the potential to}} both exacerbate and reduce these problems. Simply providing access to the world wide web per se may exacerbate the problems of information overload, since every web browser has access to hundreds of millions of pages of information. However, the cost effective provision of access to timely, current, and high quality information is what internet technology potentially offers. Creation of the National electronic Library for Health (NeLH) should be seen as an attempt to harness internet technologies to solve this information paradox. Sir Edward Waine, regius professor of medicine in Glasgow, who invented Waine's thyroid index, an early, pre-computer, decision support system, used to teach about “la <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> petit papier. ” This described the patient who, somewhat nervously, took a little bit of paper out of his jacket pocket {{towards the end of the}} consultation and used this paper to remind him of the questions that he knew he was bound to forget in the stress of the consultation. Many clinicians have now found that le <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> petit papier is now but a fond memory as they face daily “la <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> grand print-out,” an altogether more daunting challenge. The world wide web has blown away the walls and doors of medical libraries, which once shielded medical knowledge from the public gaze. Members of the public can now have access to almost all the information that professionals have...|$|R

40|$|J. M. G. Le Clézio was the {{recipient}} of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature. His Histoire <b>du</b> <b>pied</b> et autres fantaisies was published in 2011. It is a breathtaking collection of short stories which paints the portraits of women determined to fight off the difficulties they encounter. These tales have yet to be officially translated into English. The aim of this thesis was threefold—while being a translation into English of Histoire <b>du</b> <b>pied,</b> it set out to provide {{a better understanding of the}} subject of stylistics in relation to literary translation. It also posited that due to stylistic “constraints” (Boase-Beier 2006 : 54), literary translators leave inevitable “fingerprints” (Baker 2000 : 244) and resort to “textual deformation” (Berman 2000 : 286), partly naturalizing the target text in the process. I focused on the stylistic issues—namely issues pertaining to sentence structure and syntax, diction and figurative language, encountered during my translation. My stylistic choices left traces in the target text, inevitably combining authorial and translational style...|$|R

50|$|The Régie de l'assurance <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> Québec was {{established}} in 1969 {{for the purpose of}} setting up the public Health Insurance Plan. Ever since, the Régie has contributed to the development and smooth operation of Québec's healthcare system. Under Canadian federal law, all citizens and permanent residents are entitled to free basic health care, wherein each province administers their own system. Unlike most other provincial health plans, the Quebec health plan covers prescription medicines for many people. The annual cost varies depending upon each person's situation. People who are eligible for private prescription coverage are required to enroll in the private plan and are not eligible for the RAMQ prescription plan.|$|R

40|$|METHODS: The {{determinants}} {{of a new}} treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and secular trends in patient persistence with treatment among {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients were investigated. A cohort of 3768 physician-diagnosed, elderly COPD patients was selected between 1990 and 1996 from the health care administrative database of the Régie de l'assurance <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> Québec. A nested case-control design was used to identify patient and physician characteristics that were associated with a new treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. Treatment persistence with inhaled corticosteroids was also estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition to that, changes in treatment persistence over time, from 1990 to 1995, were investigated by estimating the yearly proportion of patients persisting for less than one year...|$|R

30|$|Using the {{registry}} of all medically insured {{people in the}} province of Québec (fichier d’inscription des personnes assures - FIPA) we randomly sampled 25 % of the people residing in the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in 1998. In each subsequent year, we used the FIPA to re-sample immigrants to the CMA and babies born to mothers residing in the CMA to maintain a representative, 25 % sample for each year. For sampled individuals, we obtain regular data updates from the Régie de l’assurance <b>maladie</b> <b>du</b> Québec (RAMQ) on physician billing, drugs dispensed, hospitalization records, and death certificates. The data sets are linked with an anonymized unique identifier. At any given time, the dynamic cohort contains approximately 1 million people and follow-up data span approximately 17 years.|$|R

50|$|Another {{considerable}} inter-provincial imbalance is {{a person}} who is insured by Quebec and obtains healthcare in another province or territory. Quebec does not have any physician payment agreements with any other provinces or territories of Canada. As a result, someone that sees a physician outside Quebec, even in another part of Canada, must either pay the cost themselves and submit a request to the Régie de l'Assurance <b>Maladie</b> <b>du</b> Québec (RAMQ Medicare) for reimbursement (even then, expenses are often denied), or take out a third party insurance plan. The same situation also applies to a resident of any other part of Canada visiting Quebec, only they submit any claims to their respective provincial healthplan. All provinces and territories of Canada, however, do have reciprocal hospital agreements, so hospital admissions, for example, are covered throughout Canada.|$|R
