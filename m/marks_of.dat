5|$|Hurricane Iniki made {{landfall}} on the south-central {{portion of}} Kauai island, bringing its dangerous inner core {{to the entire}} island. Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6feet (1.4–1.8m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> up to 18feet (5.5m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35feet (10.5m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800feet (250m) inland. Because it moved quickly through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.|$|E

The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marks</b> <b>of</b> cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it.

The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps.

When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of Taman Sari commenced {{during the reign}} of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755–1792), the first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, and was completed by the time of Sultan Hamengkubuwono II. The building site, however, had already been known as a bathing place called Pacethokan Spring since Sunan Amangkurat IV’s reign (1719–1726). According to Kitab Mamana in Yogyakarta Kraton, the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung Mangundipura. He had travelled twice to Batavia to learn about European architecture, which is the reason why the architecture of Taman Sari has <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> European style.|$|E
