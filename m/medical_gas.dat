40|$|During {{invasive}} {{mechanical ventilation}} {{due to the}} dryness of <b>medical</b> <b>gases</b> is necessary to provide an adequate level of conditioning. The hot water humidifiers (HWH) heat the water, thus allowing the water vapor to heat and humidify the <b>medical</b> <b>gases.</b> In the common HWH there is a contact between the <b>medical</b> <b>gases</b> and the sterile water, thus increasing the risk of patient’s colonization and infection. Recently to avoid the condensation in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, new heated ventilator circuits have been developed. In this in vitro study we evaluated the efficiency (absolute/relative humidity) of three HWH: (1) a common HWH without a heated ventilator circuit (MR 730, Fisher&Paykel, New Zeland), (2) the same HWH with a heated ventilator circuit (Mallinckrodt Dar, Italy) and (3) a new HWH (DAR HC 2000, Mallinkckrodt Dar, Italy) with a heated ventilator circuit in which the water vapor reaches the <b>medical</b> <b>gases</b> through a gorotex membrane, avoiding any direct contact between the water and gases. At a temperature of 35 °C and 37 °C the HWH and heated tube were evaluated. The absolute humidity (AH) and relative humidity (RH) were measured by a psychometric method. The minute ventilation, tidal volume respiratory rate and oxygen fraction were: 5. 8 ± 0. 1 l/min, 740 ± 258 ml, 7. 5 ± 2. 6 bpm and 100 %, respectively.
