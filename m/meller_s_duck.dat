40|$|H 9 {{influenza}} viruses {{have become}} endemic in land-based domestic poultry in Asia and have sporadically crossed to pigs and humans. To understand the molecular determinants of their adaptation to land-based birds, {{we tested the}} replication and transmission of several 1970 <b>s</b> <b>duck</b> H 9 viruses in chickens and quail. Quail were more susceptible than chickens to these viruses, and generation of recombinant H 9 viruses by reverse genetics showed that changes in the HA gene are sufficient to initiate efficient replication and transmission in quail. Seven amino acid positions on the HA molecule corresponded to adaptation to land-based birds. In quail H 9 viruses, the pattern of amino acids at these seven positions is intermediate between those of duck and chicken viruses; this fact may explain the susceptibility of quail to duck H 9 viruses. Our findings suggest that quail provide {{an environment in which}} the adaptation of influenza viruses from ducks generates novel variants that can cross the species barrier. H 9 N 2 influenza A viruses circulate worldwide (1). In North America, H 9 viruses are found mainly in shore birds but also in wild ducks (19, 34).

40|$|Canada geese, snow geese, ducks, and American coots {{all have}} been implicated in {{agricultural}} crop and turf damage. Canada geese and snow geese that graze on winter wheat and rye crops can reduce subsequent grain and vegetative yields. Canada geese also cause serious damage to sprouting soybeans in spring and to standing cornfields in the autumn. The most common damage to agricultural resources associated with geese results from consumption of crops. Other impacts involve unacceptable accumulations of feces in pastures, trampling of emerging crops, and increased erosion and runoff from fields where the cover crop has been grazed. Canada geese graze {{on a variety of}} crops, including alfalfa, barley, beans, corn, soybeans, wheat, rye, oats, spinach, and peanuts, sometimes resulting in significant reductions in yields. Since the dramatic increase in snow goose populations, there has been extensive damage to their breeding habitat in the in the Arctic and tremendous grazing pressure on exposed crops and vegetation during the early spring migration. Most damage results from grubbing, trampling, and uprooting and occurs along the migration route on the eastern coastal areas, and in the mid-western and southern states. In addition, agricultural producers are concerned that geese spread noxious seeds to crop and pasture lands and reduce livestock forage. During the fall, winter, and early spring, large flocks of ducks and American coots migrate into California where they damage small grains and alfalfa. Most damage is from grazing on alfalfa or sprouting grain. In the fall, large flocks of ducks and American coots alighting in un-harvested rice fields trample and consume the crop. Prior to the 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>ducks</b> and geese had been reported to cause as much as $ 6 million to $ 10 million in damages to grains that are swathed and laid on the ground before harvesting. Most of this damage occurred in the Canadian Provinces and Dakotas. However, changes in harvesting techniques in the 1990 s from swathing to straight- or stripper-cutting have greatly resolved the problem. Migratory Canada geese, ducks, and American coots on their winter range have become acclimated to urban environments where they graze on domesticated grasses in parks, golf courses, highway rights-of-way, sport fields, and similar locations. Damage and economic costs at these locations varies by species, numbers, and concentrations, but can be substantial. For example, damage to putting greens by geese, ducks, or coots can cost thousands of dollars to repair or replace...|$|R

We investigated the variation of four indices of duck density or breeding success in pond samples of three main French fishpond areas: Dombes, Forez and Brenne, along with {{recent changes in}} fish farming management. In Forez, where fish stocking has been frequently interrupted or fish biomass in ponds has substantially decreased during the two last decades, duck pair density strongly increased {{in the same time}} interval, but Mallard Anas platyrhynchos brood size decreased. In Brenne, no fish farming abandonment was observed but pond fertilization with organic manure or mineral nitrogen became less frequently implemented during the 2000 <b>s.</b> The <b>duck</b> brood: pair ratio decreased meanwhile, indicating either a lower nesting success or higher losses before or immediately after hatching. In Dombes, lower fish stock densities since the 1990 s did not reverse a negative trend in duck populations which started in the early 1980 s. Our results suggest that fish biomass density in fishponds might be a limiting factor for breeding waterfowl, but a decrease in the nutrient level, for example with lower fertilizer inputs, may negatively affect duck reproductive success...|$|R

Experimental infection with DHAV- 3 at 7 days of age resulted in a high mortality (66. 3 %) in 11 susceptible Z 8 S 2 families and an extremely low mortality rate (2. 67 %) in 32 Z 8 R 2 families, indicating that Z 8 R 2 exhibits strong resistance to DHAV- 3, while Z 8 S 2 is highly susceptible to the virus. Detection of DHAV- 3 in the liver between 1 and 60 hours post inoculation (hpi) suggests that DHAV- 3 can be replicated rapidly and efficiently in the liver of Z 8 S 2, whereas the replication of the virus in the liver of Z 8 R 2 is suppressed greatly. High levels of serum biochemical markers (e. g., ALT, AST, ALP and GGT) were detected in Z 8 S 2 at 24 hpi, which were significantly higher than those in Z 8 R 2. Analysis of transcripts in the liver revealed that the expression levels of several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (e. g., TLR 4 / 7, RIG- 1 and MDA 5) and cytokines (e. g., IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, IFN-α, and IFN-γ) in Z 8 S 2 were significantly higher than those in Z 8 R 2 at 12 and 24 hpi. Together these findings suggest that Z 8 R 2 and Z 8 <b>S</b> 2 Pekin <b>ducks,</b> which were derived from the same Z 8 line, exhibit disparate pathogenic outcomes following DHAV- 3 infection. Therefore, it is possible to select a Pekin duck flock resistant to DHAV- 3 employing the strategy described here. It is likely that the high viral load and the strong inflammatory response correlate with the high susceptibility of Z 8 <b>S</b> 2 Pekin <b>ducks</b> to DHAV- 3...|$|R
40|$|Cyathocotyle bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema globulus were {{previously}} {{implicated in the}} annual mortality of wild ducks in southern Quebec. Of 21 snail species collected from nine aquatic communities in southern Quebec and southeastern Ontario, May to October 1989 and 1990, only Bithynia tentaculata was heavily and consistently infected with C. bushiensis metacercariae. Although infection levels varied spatially, a consistent concave seasonal pattern of prevalence and abundance was found which {{may be due to}} overwintering metacercariae and the almost simultaneous onset of cercarial transmission and recruitment of new snails in mid-summer. Even though S. globulus metacercariae were found in 18 of 21 snail species, B. tentaculata is believed to contribute most to transmission to ducks. The variety of seasonal patterns and large scale spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence and abundance of S. globulus suggested that cercariae may be from more than one source. Some of the spatial variation in metacercarial levels may be due to small scale processes; extensive spatial heterogeneity at a scale of 10 m was detected in S. globulus cercarial transmission to sentinel snails. This small scale heterogeneity may be due to B. tentaculata having small home ranges as suggested by mark-recapture studies on movement. In aquaria, even though smaller B. tentaculata were more active than larger ones and intraspecific microhabitat preferences were found, preliminary results from ducks (Anas discors) feeding on snail communities in pools suggested that snails are ingested in proportion to their presence. Therefore, the importance of a snail species or size class in the transmission of the two parasites to ducks may depend only on its density and metacercarial abundance. Finally, another mode of transmission is proposed for <b>S.</b> globulus: <b>ducks</b> may become infected by consuming empty snail shells containing viable cysts...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of breeding waterfowl populations on various wetland habitat types {{was investigated in}} North Dakota during 1967 - 69. Data were obtained by stratified random sampling techniques. The total wetland acreage in North Dakota {{was estimated to be}} about 3. 2 million acres. Natural basin wetlands comprised about 77 percent of the acreage and 91 percent of the number of wetlands in the state and were utilized by about 76 percent of the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> breeding <b>duck</b> population. Among the four biotic regions of the state, numerical and areal composition of wetlands varied considerably. Natural basin wetlands varied from a low of about 4 percent of total wetland acreage in the Southwestern Slope Region to a high of 93 percent in the Prairie Pothole Region. About 84 percent of the statewide duck population occurred in the Prairie Pothole Region. Within the Prairie Pothole Region, seasonal (Class III) ponds comprised 36 and 23 percent, respectively, of the total acreage and number of wetlands, and semipermanent (Class IV) ponds and lakes comprised 18 and 3 percent, respectively, of these totals. Agriculture has had drastic effects on the wetlands in this region as evidenced by the fact that natural basin wetlands with tilled bottom soils (chiefly Class II and Class III wetlands) comprised about 29 percent of area but 52 percent of numbers of all wet- lands. In the Prairie Pothole Region, seasonal ponds and semipermanent ponds and lakes were utilized by about 48 and 27 percent, respectively, of the total breeding ducks. Optimum environmental conditions for breeding dabbling ducks were present during years when large numbers and acreages of seasonal (Class III) pond basins contained surface water. Semipermanent (Class IV) ponds and lakes were the principal habitats for breeding diving ducks, and were also important to dabbling ducks, particularly during dry years...|$|R
40|$|Disease control {{measures}} require poultry {{to be killed}} on farms {{to minimize the risk}} of disease being transmitted to other poultry and, in some cases, to protect public health. We assessed the welfare implications for poultry of the use of high-expansion gas-filled foam as a potentially humane, emergency killing method. In laboratory trials, broiler chickens, adult laying hens, ducks, and turkeys were exposed to air-, N 2 -, or CO 2 -filled high expansion foam (expansion ratio 300 : 1) under standardized conditions. Birds were equipped with sensors to measure cardiac and brain activity, and measurements of oxygen concentration in the foam were carried out. Initial behavioral responses to foam were not pronounced but included headshakes and brief bouts of wing flapping. Both N 2 - and CO 2 -filled foam rapidly induced ataxia/loss of posture and vigorous wing flapping in all species, characteristic of anoxic death. Immersion in air-filled, high expansion foam had little effect on physiology or behavior. Physiological responses to both N 2 - and CO 2 -filled foam were characterized by a pronounced bradyarrythymia and a series of consistent changes in the appearance of the electroencephalogram. These were used to determine an unequivocal time to loss of consciousness in relation to submersion. Mean time to loss of consciousness was 30 s in hens and 18 s in broilers exposed to N 2 -filled foam, and 16 s in broilers, 1 <b>s</b> in <b>ducks,</b> and 15 <b>s</b> in turkeys exposed to CO 2 -filled foam. Euthanasia achieved with anoxic foam was particularly rapid, which is explained by the very low oxygen concentrations (below 1 %) inside the foam. Physiological observations and postmortem examination showed that the mode of action of high expansion, gas-filled foam is anoxia, not occlusion of the airway. These trials provide proof-of-principle that submersion in gas-filled, high expansion foam provides a rapid and highly effective method of euthanasia, which may have potential to provide humane emergency killing or routine depopulatio...|$|R
40|$|The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the Northern Great Plains is {{the most}} {{important}} breeding area for waterfowl in North America. Historically, the size of breeding duck populations in the PPR has been highly correlated with spring wetland conditions. We show that one indicator of climate conditions, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), is strongly correlated with annual counts (from 1955 to 1996) of both May ponds (R 2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 0001) and breeding duck populations (R 2 = 0. 69, p < 0. 0001) in the Northcentral U. S., suggesting the utility of PDSI as an index for climatic factors important to wetlands and ducks. We then use this relationship to project future pond and duck numbers based on PDSI values generated from sensitivity analyses and two general circulation model (GCM) scenarios. We investigate the sensitivity of PDSI to fixed changes in temperature of 0 °C, + 1. 5 °C, + 2. 5 °C, and + 4. 0 °C in combination with fixed changes in precipitation of - 10 %, + 0 %, + 7 %, and + 15 %, changes spanning the range of typically-projected values for this region from human-induced climatic change. Most (11 of 12) increased temperature scenarios tested result in increased drought (due to greater evapotranspiration under warmer temperatures) and declining numbers of both wetlands and ducks. Assuming a doubling of CO 2 by 2060, both the equilibrium and transient GCM scenarios we use suggest a major increase in drought conditions. Under these scenarios, Northcentral U. <b>S.</b> breeding <b>duck</b> populations would fluctuate around means of 2. 1 or 2. 7 million ducks based on the two GCMs, respectively, instead of the present long-term mean of 5. 0 million. May pond numbers would fluctuate around means of 0. 6 or 0. 8 million ponds instead of the present mean of 1. 3 million. The results suggest that the ecologically and economically important PPR could be significantly damaged by climate changes typically projected. We make several recommendations for policy and research to help mitigate potential effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSequence {{homology}} {{between the}} amino-terminal {{region of the}} S protein of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and known fusion peptides from retroviruses and paramyxoviruses led us to propose that this region might be equally involved in the initial infective steps of hepadnaviruses. In fact, we showed that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminus region of the S protein of HBV had membrane-interacting properties {{and was able to}} induce liposome fusion adopting an extended (β-sheet) conformation (Rodrı́guez-Crespo et al., 1996, 1995). We describe herein studies on the interaction of peptides derived from the N-terminal region of the <b>S</b> protein of <b>duck</b> (DHBV: Met-Ser-Gly-Thr-Phe-Gly-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Gly-Leu-Leu) and woodchuck hepatitis B viruses (WHV: Met-Ser-Pro-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Gln-Val-Val) with liposomes. These peptides were able to induce to a different extent aggregation, lipid mixing, and leakage of internal aqueous contents from both neutral and negatively charged phospholipid vesicles in a concentration-dependent and pH-independent manner. Fluorescence depolarization of 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene-labeled vesicles indicated that both peptides become inserted into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the DHBV peptide adopts an extended conformation in the presence of lipids, whereas the WHV peptide displays a high content of α-helical conformation. Therefore, these results extend our previous findings obtained for human hepatitis B virus to other members of the hepadnavirus family and suggest that this region of the S protein is important in the initial steps of the infective cycle...|$|R
