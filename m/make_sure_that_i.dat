[...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods.

Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet."

The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production.

For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days.

The melody {{is driven by}} [...] "beating" [...] drums and [...] "pounding" [...] synths. According to Rick Florino, from Artistdirect.com, the song also uses elements of [...] "propulsive house" [...] music. The lyrics center around Lopez's love for dancing for her man. Florino described the song's middle-8 breakdown as [...] "a bass thump and seductive Spanish lines that pulsate in tandem before one final crescendo of the chorus."
