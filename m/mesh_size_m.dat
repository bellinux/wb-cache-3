40|$|The European {{electricity}} directive of 1997 {{triggers the}} re-organization {{of the electricity}} market. This guideline obligated Austria to open gradually its electricity market for competition. In a demonstration study a methodology was developed which can support the national regulation authority to differentiate costs spatially in accordance to terrain and settlement structure. The methodology {{is applied to the}} whole territory of Austria. This paper describes the fragmentation measures based on remotely sensed data which distinguish areas with relative compact sealed surfaces and fragmented areas. The most relevant indices include three measures of fragmentation introduced by Jaeger (2000) : degree of landscape division (D), splitting index (S), and effective <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> (<b>m).</b> They characterize the anthropogenic penetration of landscapes from a geometric point of view and are calculated from the distribution function of the remaining patch sizes. The methodology will serve as a baseline for a fair energy delivery price based on spatially explicit infrastructure costs. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{mixing process}} is studied in grid-generated {{turbulent}} flow for single- and bubbly two-phase flow systems. Concentration and mixing characteristics in the liquid phase are measured {{with the aid}} of a PLIF/PLIF arrangement. A nearly isotropic turbulent flow field is generated at the center of the vertical pipe by using a honeycomb, three grids and a contraction. In two-phase flow experiments, air bubbles were injected into the flow from a rectangular grid, with <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> <b>M</b> = 6 mm, which is placed midway between two circular grids each with a mesh size of M = 2 mm. For single-phase flow, the normalized mean concentration cross-stream profiles have rather similar Gaussian shapes, and the cross-stream profiles of the normalized root-mean-square (RMS) values of concentration were found to be quite similar. Cross-stream profiles of the mean concentration, for bubbly two-phase flow, were also found to be quite similar, but they did not have the Gaussian shape of the profiles for single-phase flow. Almost self-similar behavior was also found for the RMS values of the concentration in two-phase systems. The turbulent diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase was also calculated. At the center of the plume, the flow was found to have a periodic coherent structure, probably of vortex shedding character. Observations showed that the period of oscillation is higher in the case of two-phase flow than in single-phase flow...|$|E

Among these, the case with the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 100 <b>m</b> and α = 0.625 α 0 gives the best result, and accordingly, we now discuss the result of this case (the reference case) in some detail, in order to compare it with the benchmark results of Day et al.

30|$|From {{the present}} study, we {{conclude}} that the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> has a significant influence on the accuracy of our FE simulations of fault rupture. For the present fault test model, {{the use of a}} <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 100 <b>m,</b> among our other simulation cases, yields the best accuracy. The proper selection of damping coefficient for a particular frequency can reduce spurious high-frequency oscillation while having little effect on accuracy, and can further improve the performance of the model. For the case of <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 100 <b>m</b> with α = 0.625 α 0, it is found that although the oscillations affect less the results of rupture times (Fig. 6) and shear traction time histories as shown Figs. 7 and 8, they do affect the accuracy of the slip rate so that it would cause difficulties for further parametric investigation. It would be helpful to adopt some smoothing algorithms (e.g., Galis et al., 2010) in our FE formulation in the future.|$|R

The latter have been estimated using Laser Doppler Anemometer to measure simultaneously the velocities in two different points in the flow. To minimise the effect of virtual particle bias and of geometry bias the control volume dimensions have been reduced collecting the light in side scatter and using short focal length lenses. The methodology has been tested in the isotropic and homogeneous region of a turbulent flow downstream of a grid where ε {{is proportional to the}} kinetic energy decay. The measurements were carried out in a water rig for a Reynolds number ReM of 5500, based on a <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> <b>M</b> (5. 5 mm) of the grid, along the centreline in a range between 23 - 35 M. Isotropic and homogenous conditions were satisfactorily achieved. In agreement with theory, the turbulent kinetic energy decayed exponentially along the centreline with a decay coefficient of 1. 3. In Figure 1 the viscous dissipation rate derived from the kinetic energy decay (blue squares) is compared with the direct measurement ε (red circles) for different distances from the grid. The average difference between the two values along the centreline is about 7 %. Further measurements were taken {{in the wake of a}} cylinder for a Reynolds number Red of 7200.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of effectiveness and heat transfer on a cylinder model with showerhead cooling {{has been conducted}} in a free jet test facility, using the transient liquid crystal technique. A three- and a four-row configuration, covering a region of ± 21 °, were chosen to study the cooling behaviour for zero and off-design incidences. Typical engine airfoil leading edge conditions were maintained for the freestream Reynolds and Mach numbers to 1. 55 e 5 and 0. 26 for the three-row, and 1. 84 e 5 and 0. 30 for the four-row configuration, at a turbulence intensity of 7 %. The blowing and momentum rates were varied from 0. 4 to 1. 8 and 0. 1 to 1. 9, at a density ratio of 1. 65. At zero incidence it could be observed for both configurations that the highest effectiveness of about 0. 3 was achieved at a blowing rate of 0. 4. Negative incidence for the four-row configuration resulted in much higher effectiveness, being as high as 0. 5 at a blowing rate of 0. 9, with an associated high heat transfer. Much lower effectiveness was achieved at positive incidence, where the blowing rate of 0. 9 showed the best cooling behaviour. Higher effectivenessbut also increased heat transferwas in general observed for the four-row configuration, with a 60 % higher massflow.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of agricultural nonpoint source pollution models depends {{to a great}} extent on how well model input spatial parameters describe the relevant characteristics of the watershed. It is assumed that reducing the precision of spatial input parameters affects the simulation results of runoff and sediment yield from the entire watershed. However, there may be no significant increase in the {{accuracy of}} models, as a result of more precise topographic or soil information, which increase the input data collection and preparation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of the digital elevation model, DEM (from 20 to 500 m) and the soil map scale (1 / 25, 000; 1 / 250, 000 and; 1 / 500, 000 scale) within the Soil and Water Analysis Tool (SWAT) to simulate runoff, sediment, and NO 3 -N loads at the outlet of an agricultural watershed. Results of the Lower Walnut Creek (21. 8 km(2), central Iowa) showed that an upper limit to DEM <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 50 <b>m</b> is required to simulate watershed loads. Decreasing the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> beyond this threshold does not substantially affect the computed runoff flux but generated prediction errors for nitrogen and sediment yields. Whatever the DEM <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> considered, a detailed soil map has to be considered to accurately estimate the loads. Finally, the impacts of DEM <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and soil map scale on the modeling results are discussed in respect of the relevant characteristics of the watershed and included in SWAT.

40|$|Catch and mesh {{selectivity}} of wire-meshed fish traps {{were tested}} for eleven different <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 13 X 13 mm (0. 5 x 0. 5 ") to 76 x 152 mm (3 X 6 "). A total of 1, 810 fish (757 kg) representing 85 species and 28 families were captured during 330 trap hauls off southeastern Florida from December 1986 to July 1988. <b>Mesh</b> <b>size</b> significantly affected catches. The 1. 5 " hexagonal mesh caught the most fish by number, weight, and value. Catches tended to decline as meshes got smaller or larger. Individual fish size increased with larger meshes. Laboratory mesh retention experiments showed relationships between <b>mesh</b> shape and <b>size</b> and individual retention for snapper (Lutjanidae), grouper (Serranidae), jack (Carangidae), porgy (Sparidae), and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae). These relationships {{may be used}} to predict the effect of <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> on catch rates. Because <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and shape greatly influenced catchability, regulating <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> may provide a useful basis for managing the commercial trap fishery...|$|R

In this paper, the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> field at a point x is isotropic, i.e. h(x)=h 1 (x)=h 2 (x)=h 3 (x). The extension to anisotropic meshing will be done in a forthcoming work.|$|R

Codend selectivity experiments were conducted in the Northwest Atlantic. The paper examines the selectivity characteristics of codends, identifies benefits resulting from modifications in <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> in the redfish fishery and explains why the increase in <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> in the Northwest Atlantic redfish fishery is inappropriate...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} European hake Merluccius merluccius gill net {{selectivity}} was undertaken off the Algarve (Southern Portugal), between 1999 and 2001. Four nominal <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> (70, 80, 90 and 100 mm) {{were used in}} fishing trials and the 'share each length class catch total' (SELECT) method was used to fit gill net selectivity curves. Hake {{were caught in the}} same size range by all <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes,</b> between 17 and 65 cm total length. While most fishes were wedged, significant and similar proportions were entangled in all <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes,</b> contributing to the wide size range, and in some cases, bimodal shape of catch size frequency distributions. Insignificant numbers of undersized hake were caught, with most catches consisting of mature female fish. Catch rates decreased sharply with increasing <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> The bimodal model gave the best fit for hake that were wedged, with estimated modal lengths of 40. 1, 46. 7 and 51. 0 cm for the 70, 80 and 90 mm nominal <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes,</b> respectively. The high catch per unit effort of the smallest <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> with most fish caught being female, together {{with the fact that the}} modal length of the fitted selectivity curve is well below the size at maturity for hake in Portuguese waters, suggests that the 80 mm nominal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> is more appropriate for ensuring resource sustainability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>mesh</b> <b>sizing</b> {{functions for}} discretization of a wind turbine blade as a shell structure. Two different functions, one along the blade span {{and the other}} chord-wise, are presented. The effect {{of the magnitude of}} the aerodynamic force has been considered in a span-wise <b>mesh</b> <b>sizing</b> function to obtain a force-adaptive mesh generator, applicable when the blade needs to be analysed as a part of an aero-structure problem. The direction of the aerodynamic force has been considered in the chord-wise <b>mesh</b> <b>sizing</b> function to improve the mesh efficiency. Results show a large improvement in the rate of convergence when the direction of the external force contributes towards the chord-wise <b>mesh</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R
40|$|Selectivity {{parameters}} of gillnets used for fish catching {{are very important}} for fisheries management in lakes. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to estimate the selectivity {{parameters of}} monofilament gill nets <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 56, 64 and 72 mm (stretched <b>mesh</b> <b>size)</b> used for European chub (Leuciscus cephalus L. 1758) in Atikhisar Reservoir, Canakkale, Turkey. The indirect method proposed by Holt was used for the estimation of the selectivity parameters. The common selection factors and common standard deviation of monofilament gill nets were determined as 4. 25 and 2. 37, respectively. For sustainable fisheries of european chub, the minimum <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of monofilament gill nets must be greater than 47 mm stretched <b>mesh</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R
40|$|Existing {{methods of}} {{determining}} the best <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> for tropical multispecies trawl fisheries are highly simplistic and do not reliably estimate the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> providing maximum yield in weight or value. A method of estimating the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> providing greatest yield by weight or value is presented, based on the Beverton and Holt (1957) single-species model. Yield-per-recruit analysis is inapplicable in a multispecies fishery, and calculation of optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> requires estimates of relative recruit-ment to the populations comprising the fishery. Methods of estimating absolute or relative recruitment from commercial catch and effort time series data, average commercial catch data, and research vessel survey data are given. The methods of estimating optimum <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and recruitment are applied to data from the northwest shelf of Australia. The estimates of relative recruitment provided by all methods were consistent. The (stretched) <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> optimizing total catch for the NW shelf fishery was stable {{over a wide range}} of input parameter values, inclu-ding fishing mortality and recruitment. In principle, total yield can be estimated if estimates of absolute recruitment are available, but sensitivity analysis indicates the precision of yield estimated to be very low...|$|R
