25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum).|$|E

50|$|The Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest is a {{state forest}} located in the Piedmont of Virginia in Appomattox and Buckingham counties. Its 19808 acre are covered {{with a mix of}} oak-hickory and pine forest. Dominant tree species include oaks (white, chestnut, black, {{northern}} red, southern red and scarlet), <b>hickories</b> (<b>mockernut</b> and pignut), yellow poplar, red maple, and pines (loblolly, shortleaf, and Virginia). It is the largest state forest in Virginia.|$|R
50|$|Shellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most {{typical of}} the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils, but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory {{requires}} moister situations than do pignut, <b>mockernut,</b> or shagbark <b>hickories</b> (Carya glabra, C. alba, or C. ovata), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils.|$|R
50|$|True hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after {{cutting and}} fire. As the stumps {{increase}} in size, {{the number of}} stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan <b>hickory</b> grafts were <b>mockernut</b> and water <b>hickory</b> (Carya aquatica).|$|R

50|$|Mockernut {{grows on}} Inceptisols in an {{estimated}} 15 {{percent of its}} range. These clayey soils are moderate to high in nutrients and are primarily in the Appalachians on gentle to moderate slopes where water is available to plants during the growing season. In the northern Appalachians on slopes of 25 percent or less, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> grows on poorly drained loams with a fragipan. In the central and southern Appalachians on slopes 25 percent or less, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> grows on fine loams. On steeper slopes it grows on coarse loams.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> grows {{primarily}} on Ultisols occurring on an estimated 65 {{percent of its}} range, including much of the southern to northeastern United States. These soils are low in nutrients and usually moist, but during the warm season, they are dry part of the time. Along the mid-Atlantic and in the southern and western range, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> grows {{on a variety of}} soils on slopes of 25 percent or less, including combinations of fine to coarse loams, clays, and well-drained quartz sands. On slopes steeper than 25 percent, mockernut often grows on coarse loams.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory,</b> a true hickory, grows from Massachusetts and New York west to {{southern}} Ontario, southern Michigan, and northern Illinois; then to southeastern Iowa, Missouri, and eastern Kansas, south to eastern Texas and east to northern Florida. This species {{is not present}} in New Hampshire and Vermont as previously mapped by Little. <b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> is most abundant southward through Virginia, North Carolina and Florida where {{it is the most}} common of the hickories.

50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> {{nuts are}} {{consumed}} by {{many species of}} birds and other animals, including wood duck, red-bellied woodpecker, red fox, squirrels, beaver, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, turkey, white-tailed deer, white-footed mice, and others. Many insect pests eat hickory leaves and bark. Mockernut hickories also provide cavities for animals to live in, such as woodpeckers, black rat snakes, raccoons, Carolina chickadees, and more. They are also good nesting trees, providing cover for birds with their thick foliage. Animals help disperse seeds so that new hickories can grow elsewhere. Chipmunks, squirrels, and birds do this best. Some fungi grow on <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> roots, sharing nutrients from the soil.|$|E
50|$|At {{certain times}} during its life, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> may be {{variously}} classified as tolerant to intolerant. Overall it {{is classified as}} intolerant of shade. It recovers rapidly from suppression and is probably a climax species on moist sites.|$|E
50|$|The hickories (Carya spp.) of this {{ecoregion}} are identifiable {{by their}} pinnately compound leaves. They include pignut (Carya glabra) and <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya tomentosa), {{both of which}} grow {{on a variety of}} sites from dry ridges to mesic habitats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> is a large, {{true hickory}} with a dense crown. This species {{occasionally}} grows to about 30 m tall and 91 cm in d.b.h., but heights and diameters usually {{range from about}} 15 and 46 to 61 cm, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The seed is {{dispersed}} from September through December. <b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> {{requires a}} minimum of 25 years to reach commercial seed-bearing age. Optimum seed production occurs from 40 to 125 years, and the maximum age listed for commercial seed production is 200 years.|$|E
5000|$|The Allegheny-Cumberland dry oak {{forest and}} {{woodlands}} are typically dominated by white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Less frequent are red maple (Acer rubrum), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), and <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya tomentosa).|$|E
50|$|Hickories {{are noted}} for their variability, and many natural hybrids are known among North American species. Hickories usually can be crossed {{successfully}} within the genus. Geneticists recognize that <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> hybridizes naturally with: C. illinoensis (Carya x schneckii Sarg.) and C. ovata (Carya x collina Laughlin).|$|E
50|$|Mockernut is {{not easily}} injured by ice glaze or snow, but young {{seedlings}} are very susceptible to frost damage. Many birds and animals feed on the nuts of <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory.</b> This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> {{produces}} one of {{the heaviest}} seeds of the hickory species; cleaned seeds range from 70 to 250 seeds/kg (32 to 113/lb). Seed is disseminated mainly by gravity and wildlife, particularly squirrels. Birds also help disperse seed. Wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks often bury the seed at {{some distance from the}} seed-bearing tree.|$|E
50|$|These forests {{occur on}} dry and dry-mesic sites and are {{dominated}} by oaks and hickories. These habitats are protected from fires by either steep topography, isolation, or limited flammability of the vegetation. Typical canopy species include white oak (Quercus alba), sand laurel oak (Quercus hemisphaerica), <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya tomentosa), and pignut hickory (Carya glabra).|$|E
50|$|High winds, salt spray, {{and sandy}} soil provide a harsh {{environment}} for plant life. Maritime forests {{are composed of}} deciduous, coniferous, and broadleaf evergreens. Some of the trees that occupy maritime forests include the southern sugar maple, swamp dogwood, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory,</b> white ash, and the white poplar.Some animals that live in these forests are: foxes, deer, rabbits, tree frogs, raccoons, toads, painted buntings, and many others.|$|E
50|$|The climate where <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> grows {{is usually}} humid. Within its range the mean annual {{precipitation}} measures from 890 mm in the north to 2030 mm in the south. During the growing season (April through September), annual precipitation varies from 510 to 890 mm.

50|$|Good seed crops occur every 2 to 3 {{years with}} light seed crops in {{intervening}} years. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of fresh seed will germinate. Fourteen <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> trees in southeastern Ohio produced {{an average annual}} crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39 percent were sound, 48 percent aborted, and 13 percent had insect damage. Hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) is probably {{a major factor in}} reducing germination.|$|E
50|$|Sphagnum mosses, sedges, {{and other}} {{herbaceous}} plants grow on Central Mountain. The federally endangered northeastern bulrush also grows on it. Numerous species use the mountain as a habitat. In addition to hemlock, the {{main tree species}} on the mountain include yellow birch, black birch, black gum, sugar maple, red maple, white oak, chestnut oak, red oak, white pine, sassafras, basswood, tulip poplar, pignut hickory, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory,</b> shagbark hickory, and ash.|$|E
50|$|Carya tomentosa, (<b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory,</b> mockernut, white hickory, {{whiteheart}} hickory, hognut, bullnut) is {{a tree in}} the Juglandaceae or walnut family. The {{most abundant}} of the hickories, common in {{the eastern half of}} the US, it is long lived, sometimes reaching the age of 500 years. A straight-growing hickory, a high percentage of its wood is used for products where strength, hardness, and flexibility are needed. The wood makes an excellent fuelwood, as well.|$|E
50|$|Other tree {{associates}} of black oak include pignut hickory (Carya glabra), <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> (C. tomentosa), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), and shagbark hickory (C. ovata); American elm (Ulmus americana) and slippery elm (U. rubra); white ash (Fraxinus americana); black walnut (Juglans nigra) and butternut (J. cinerea); scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), southern red oak (Q. falcata), and chinkapin oak (Q. muehlenbergii); red maple (Acer rubrum) and sugar maple (A. saccharum); black cherry (Prunus serotina); and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica).|$|E
50|$|The current {{annual growth}} of <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> on dry sites is {{estimated}} at about 1.0 m³/ha (15 ft³/acre). In fully stocked stands on moderately fertile soil2.1 m³ /ha (30 ft³ /acre) is estimated, though annual growth rates of 3.1 m³/ha (44 ft³/acre) were reported in Ohio (26). Greenwood and bark weights for commercial-size mockernut trees from mixed hardwoods in Georgia are available for total tree and saw-log stems to a 4-inch top for trees 5 to 22 inches d.b.h..|$|E
50|$|<b>Mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> is {{used for}} tool handles {{requiring}} high shock resistance. It {{is used for}} ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, poles, shafts, well pumps, and furniture. Lower grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, and so on. Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats, and mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams. Though mockernut kernels are edible, because of their size they are rarely eaten by humans.|$|E
50|$|Hickory seeds show embryo {{dormancy}} {{that can}} be overcome by stratification in a moist medium at 1° to 4 °C (33° to 40 °F) for 30 to 150 days. When stored {{for a year or}} more, seed may require stratification for only 30 to 60 days. Hickory nuts seldom remain viable in the ground for more than I year. Hickory species normally require a moderately moist seedbed for satisfactory seed germination, and <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> seems to reproduce best in moist duff. Germination is hypogeal.|$|E
50|$|In the north, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> {{is found}} on drier soils of ridges and hillsides and less {{frequently}} on moist woodlands and alluvial bottoms. The species grows and develops best on deep, fertile soils. In the Cumberland Mountains and hills of southern Indiana, it grows on dry {{sites such as}} south and west slopes or dry ridges mockernut grows in Alabama and Mississippi on sandy soils with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and loblolly pine (P taeda). However, most of the merchantable mockernut grows on moderately fertile upland soils.|$|E
50|$|Black Bayou Lake is {{studded with}} cypress and tupelo trees, and {{surrounded}} by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods. Cherrybark oak, cedar elm, ash, hickories and willow oak dominate the lower areas while shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, <b>mockernut</b> <b>hickory</b> and post oak dominate the upland sites. Common wildlife seen include alligators, wood ducks, bird-voiced treefrogs, broad-banded water snakes, red-eared sliders, green herons, coyotes, skunks, and white-tailed deer. The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species.|$|E
