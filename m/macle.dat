5000|$|Crystal {{inclusions}} in diamonds {{occurs in}} the form of lines known as graining. Graining {{should not be confused with}} a rough diamonds natural grain lines [...] Graining forms due to the improper crystallization of the diamond or when a diamond is twinned. Twinned diamonds are two diamonds that have grown together and causes cross-grains within the diamond during its growth / crystallization process. Twinning causes natural lines, planes or cross-grains in a diamond. Graining can't be removed during the polishing process of a diamond as it is a natural plane within the diamond. Cross-graining also makes the polishing process extremely difficult for diamond cutters as a diamond only cuts against its natural grain lines and never with the grain. One will always find graining in rough diamonds known as [...] "Macle's". Macles are easily identified by its triangular shape. The graining line on the <b>Macle</b> is a natural cleaving plane where the diamond can easily be split in half. Diamonds with graining will never be graded as Flawless as its maximum grade would only fetch Internally Flawless (IF). Although graining seems like a severe flaw it is not visible with the naked eye and does not impact the overall brilliance or quality of a diamond.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The optimal {{ablation}} {{approach for}} patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. In particular, it is unclear if pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation (PVI) is sufficient as a lone strategy for persistent AF. Furthermore, if additional substrate ablation is to be added, the ideal approach to substrate ablation {{is yet to be}} determined. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the optimal strategy of catheter ablation of persistent AF by comparing the efficacy of 3 strategies: PVI vs PVI plus complex fractionated electrogram (CFE) ablation (PVI + CFE) vs PVI plus linear ablation (PVI + Lines). STUDY DESIGN: The STAR AF II study (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01203748) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial with a blinded assessment of outcomes. A total of 549 patients will be randomized in a 1 : 4 : 4 fashion to one of the investigation arms: PVI, PVI + CFE, and PVI + Lines, respectively. Patients undergoing a first-time ablation procedure for symptomatic, persistent AF that is refractory to at least 1 antiarrhythmic medication will be included. Persistent AF will be defined as a sustained episode lasting > 7 days and 30 seconds at 18 months after 1 or 2 ablation procedures with or without antiarrhythmic medications. CONCLUSIONS: The STAR AF II study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the optimal approach for catheter ablation of persistent AF.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{interaction}} between lattice dislocations and grain boundaries in Ni 3 A 1 has been investi-gated {{by means of}} in situ TEM deformation experiments. The {{interaction between}} screw dislocations and a coherent twin boundary could be analyzed in detail. The interaction mechanism found experimentally was compared {{to the results of}} a computer modelling study. In the computer modelling study, many-body potentials representing Ni 3 A 1 were used. The results of the in situ straining indicate that (110) screw dislocations impinging on a Z = 3 coherent twin boundary that have a Burgers vector that is parallel to the grain boundary plane can be transmitted to the symmetric slip plane in the other grain under influence of an applied stress. A one-to-one comparison with the results of a computer modelling study of exactly the same system in Ni 3 AI can be made and the experiment agrees with the simulations. Also, observations were made of superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF) that were formed {{as a result of the}} interaction between gliding dislocations and the dislocations of a low angle grain boundary (cell wall). The creation of jogs in the line of the gliding dislocation may be the cause of the SISF formation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{compared}} generalized complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) ablation {{versus a}} selective CFAE ablation strategy targeting areas of continuous electric activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects with symptomatic, persistent/high-burden paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled at 6 centers (n= 86) and randomized to 1 of 2 arms. For group I, all CFAE regions with an interval confidence level > 7 were ablated followed by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). For group II, only CFAE sites with continuous electric activity were ablated followed by PVI. For PVI, all 4 PV antra were isolated with confirmed entrance block. Subjects were followed for 1 {{year with a}} visit, ECG, and 48 -hour Holter every 3 months. Symptoms were confirmed by loop recording. The primary end point was freedom from arrhythmia > 30 seconds at 1 year. For both group I and II, CFAE ablation prolonged AF cycle length (25 ± 33 versus 23 ± 33 ms; P= 0. 78) and resulted in similar rates of AF termination (37 % versus 28 %; P= 0. 42). Radiofrequency duration during CFAE ablation was significantly less in group II (23 ± 20 versus 38 ± 20 minutes; P= 0. 002). At 1 -year follow-up, freedom from AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence was significantly higher in group I versus group II after 1 procedure (50 % versus 28 %; P= 0. 03). There were also significantly fewer repeat procedures in group I (13 % versus 36 %; P= 0. 021). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous electric activity ablation+PVI result in a similar incidence of acute AF termination with significantly less radiofrequency time. However, incidence of repeat procedures and long-term recurrence of AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia are significantly lower using generalized CFAE ablation+PVI.

40|$|Background: Adjuvant {{ablation}} {{of complex}} fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) {{in addition to}} pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) likely improves procedural outcome compared to PVI alone, particularly in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). However, CFAE regions can be extensive, occasionally requiring {{a large amount of}} extra ablation. Some CFAE regions may also represent passive wavefront collision and may not require ablation. Thus, there is interest in identifying more selective CFAE sites that are critical to AF perpetuation, minimizing the amount of adjuvant ablation that must be performed. Objective: The SELECT AF study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial comparing a strategy of PVI plus generalized CFAE ablation versus a strategy of PVI plus selective CFAE ablation, focusing on regions of continuous electrical activity (CEA). The primary efficacy endpoint is freedom from atrial arrhythmia at 1 year and the primary safety endpoint is total radiofrequency (RF) delivery time per procedure. Methods: Patients undergoing a first time ablation procedure for symptomatic persistent AF will be included. Patients with permanent AF or with left atrial size ≥ 55 mm will be excluded. Patients will all receive PVI {{at the time of their}} ablation, but will be randomized 1 : 1 to receive adjuvant CFAE ablation using the traditional “generalized” approach, or a “selective” approach targeting only CEA regions. Both strategies will be guided by automated mapping algorithms. This study will enroll a minimum of 80 evaluable subjects; 40 in each randomization group. Conclusions: SELECT AF is a randomized trial in patients with persistent AF to evaluate the efficacy of selective versus generalized CFAE ablation in addition to traditional PVI.

40|$|Abstract Background: McCune-Albright {{syndrome}} (MAS) {{is a rare}} non-inherited disorder {{characterized by}} the clinical triad of precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait skin lesions, and fibrous dysplasia of bone. Case Presentation: We report a girl with MAS, presenting initially with vaginal bleeding {{at the age of}} 17 months. Ultrasonography revealed unilateral ovarian cysts and ureteral and ovarian enlargement. Considering the clinical and paraclinical findings, the patient diagnosed as a case of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty was treated with medroxy-progestrone acetate (MPA) for three months. During the follow up, recurrent episodes of bleeding, ovarian activation and cyst formation, as well as breast size development were reported. At the age of 5. 5 years, fibrous dysplasia was detected, which in coexistence with precocious puberty confirmed the diagnosis of MAS. The patient had no cafe-au-lait skin <b>macles</b> during follow up. Conclusion: Considering that clinical manifestations of MAS appear later in the course of recurrent periods of ovarian activation and cyst formation, a careful clinical observation and follow up of patients is necessary and the diagnosis of MAS must be kept in mind in cases with gonadotropinindependent precocious puberty...|$|R
