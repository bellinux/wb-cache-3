5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E

Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is listed}} on Annex 1 (Highly <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species)</b> of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> (CMS; {{also known as}} the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly <b>migratory</b> <b>species,</b> they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may nest {{as single}} pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while {{medium-sized}} bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> nest in large colonies that can {{number in the}} thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat has been largely lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E

5|$|The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> of Wild Animals (CMS) is {{the only}} global {{organization}} that conserves {{a broad range of}} animals, of which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS, and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{fin whale}} is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species</b> of Wild Animals (CMS).

5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more <b>migratory</b> <b>species</b> that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on <b>Migratory</b> <b>Species,</b> and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E
