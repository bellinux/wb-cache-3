30|$|Compiled {{values of}} average crop yield and crop water {{requirement}} (CWR) {{were used in}} calculations to quantify water requirements for the selected crops and countries. The calculations incorporated one crop growth period to obtain the following: (1) water volume (m 3) required to grow one hectare of crop; (2) crop yield (kg) per 1, 000  m 3 (264, 172 gal) water volume; (3) total water volume (m 3) required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop produced; (4) daily water volume (m 3) required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop produced; and (5) land area (ha) required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop.|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} toxicity, chromium(VI) salts {{are used for}} the {{preservation}} of wood. For example, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Power and {{communications}} across Rodrigues {{and the island}} of Mauritius were crippled by the storm, with {{the entirety of the}} former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses {{as a result of the}} storm. Approximately 15 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> flour and 20 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million. Property damage from the storm amounted to US$50 million, and there were four deaths on the island; three were caused by traffic accidents, and the other was a man who died while making storm preparations.|$|E
5|$|Russia has a {{long history}} of {{reprocessing}} spent fuel for military purposes, and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel, possibly including some of the 33,000 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the U.S., which the U.S. originally pledged to take back, such as Brazil, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Mexico, Slovenia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{were calculated}} from crop water requirement (CWR) and average crop yield as {{explained in the}} Methods: (1) water volume required to grow one hectare of crop; (2) crop yield per 1000  m 3 water; (3) total water volume required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop produced; (4) daily water volume required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop produced; and (5) land area required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop. CWR varies by climate and is independent of soil characteristics. Average crop yield depends upon the factors such as farming practices, use of pesticides, fertilizers, and soil conditions. These factors differ among countries and {{may be related to}} infrastructure, technological development, and economic stability. Most average crop yields are greater in developed countries than in less developed countries, which results in greater total water volume (m 3) required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> crop production in the less developed countries. Qadir et al. (2007) noted that the average volume of water needed to grow cereal crops in developed countries is less than that required in developing countries. Two (Chad and Sudan) of the 15 countries studied are among the least developed countries (LDCs) according to the United Nations (UN 2011). As an example from the results of our study, CWR for wheat in Egypt is approximately equal to that in Chad (Table  4), whereas average crop yield for wheat is 61, 271 hg/ha in Egypt and only 18, 767 hg/ha in Chad (Table  3). The difference in average crop yield results in a much greater calculated volume of water required per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> wheat produced in Chad (3, 032  m 3) than in Egypt (930  m 3) (Table  7).|$|R

5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of Soviet and Chinese military aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> goods (worth $330million) from communist-bloc countries, a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's aid was slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E
5|$|Granat was a three-axis-stabilized {{spacecraft}} and {{the last}} of the 4MV Bus produced by the Lavochkin Scientific Production Association. It was similar to the Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 metric tons and carried almost 2.3 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its solar arrays. The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400W.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 24,000 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> plastic are {{dumped into}} the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E

An unsheltered exercise yard (palaestra) also formed part of the complex. The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under-floor system connected to three furnaces.

5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 million <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production {{has since been}} increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
