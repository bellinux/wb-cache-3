40|$|A {{systematic}} {{experimental study}} {{was performed to}} elucidate the conditions for which cellular patterns of diluted hydrogen diffusion flames near extinction were observed. The formation of cellular instabilities was studied for several burners: jet burners (axisymmetric jet and two-dimensional jet) and a novel one-dimensional burner. The fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers and the initial <b>mixture</b> <b>strength</b> (fuel-to-oxygen concentration ratio normalized by the stoichiometric value) were identified as the key governing parameters. The formation of cellular flames occurs for low reactant Lewis numbers (less than one) and near the extinction limit. For the jet burners, the parameter space for cellularity was found to decrease with either decreasing initial <b>mixture</b> <b>strength,</b> either increasing the fuel jet velocity. For a given fuel mixture, the wavelength associated with the cellular instabilities was found to decrease with either decreasing oxygen concentration, or increasing the fuel jet velocity. To study the supression of hydrodynamic effects on the cellular instabilities, a unique burner was constructed to experimentally realize a onedimensional unstrained planar non-premixed flame, previously only considered in idealized theoretical models. The results shos that when the oxidizer diffuses against the bulk flow the propensity of cellular instabilities increases with decreasing the initial <b>mixture</b> <b>strength</b> which is {{in agreement with the}} theoretical predicitions for this type of burner as well as experimental results for jet diffusion flames...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{electrical}} analysis of emulsified asphalt and aggregate explains the reaction {{mechanism of the}} emulsified asphalt and aggregate. When emulsified asphalt and wet mineral aggregate contact each other, asphalt particles with a charge have chemical adsorption with aggregate at the surface of mineral aggregate, and asphalt particles are arranged {{on the surface of}} later quickly. Subsequently, asphalt of recycled mixture can be more cohesive after a series of process between emulsion and aggregate, such as demulsification and drying by distillation. A compact structure is formed by asphalt wrapping aggregate to make recycled <b>mixture</b> high <b>strength.</b> The mole- coulomb theory analyzes formation principle of emulsified asphalt cold recycled <b>mixture</b> <b>strength.</b> The strength of the recycled mixture mainly depends on the cohesion and internal friction among materials.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{non-uniform}} methane diffusion flames, formed from a porous plug burner spinning in quiescent air are investigated numerically in a three-dimensional context. Flames are simulated for Damköhler {{numbers on the}} upper branch of the S-response curve close to the extinction point. Multi-dimensional instabilities appear at these near extinction Damköhler numbers, as observed in experimental studies of flames sustained by a rotating fuel disk [1] and by a rotating porous burner[2], [3]. Simulation results from the constant density and constant viscosity model suggest that the non-uniform flames {{are a result of}} thermodiffusional instabilities and are a function of the Damköhler number. Non-uniform flames simulated in this study include flame holes, single armed spirals and double armed spirals. The flame holes have stationary edges and the radius of these holes is found to increase as the Damköhler number is lowered. The single and double spirals have edges that rotate about the axis of the burner. It is found that the velocity of the single spiral relative to the flow is considerably higher than that of the double spiral. It is also found that the shapes of the spirals are affected by the velocity vectors and by interactions between distinct spiral arms. Analyses of the scalar dissipation and cross-scalar dissipation rates of these flames show that the flames are primarily diffusion flames with some premixing near the edges. ii Factors, other than the Damköhler number, that are found to significantly affect the stability of the spinning porous plug burner include the <b>mixture</b> <b>strength</b> and the exit velocity at the burner surface.

40|$|The {{effect of}} partial premixing {{on the local}} {{topology}} of globally stoichiometric flames was considered using a novel burner that permits controlled transverse variation of equivalence ratio along a continuous stratified flame front. Five iso-octane/air V-flames with different levels of stratification were studied in experiments designed to quantify differences in flame surface density and curvature between a reference homogeneous case and four different gradient cases. The mean equivalence ratio along the stratified flame front was characterized for each flame condition using 3 -pentanone planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) conditioned to the reactants. PLIF of OH and CH 2 O were subsequently used to obtain progress variable, flame surface density, and curvature measurements for locally stoichiometric flamelets subjected to varying equivalence ratio gradients. To ensure fair comparison among conditions and to eliminate potential effects due to variable <b>mixture</b> <b>strengths,</b> a unique variable interrogation window approach was used to fix the range of equivalence ratios considered {{in the analysis of}} flames under different gradients. Results showed a significant increase in flame wrinkling with increased gradients in equivalence ratio, as well as increased variability in the local intensities of OH PLIF images. The effect of increased flame surface density was more modest, balanced in part by an increase in flame brush thickness and ultimately by a decrease in flame length. Observed variations in curvature distribution were not nearly as prominent as those reported in the literature for globally lean methane/air V-flames, which suggests that although gradients in <b>mixture</b> <b>strength</b> may alter the overall structure and instantaneous behavior of globally stoichiometric combustion systems, their effect on the topology of locally stoichiometric flames may be limited. 9 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

Aromatic fuels have lower maximum heat release rates and lower knock intensities than expected from their octane number when compared to paraffinic fuels; this is observed even when there is significant heating of the end-gas from pre-flame reactions. Leaner mixtures have lower combustion rates so that pressure development is slowed and hence ignition needs to be more advanced to get knock to occur as frequently as in a richer mixture.

40|$|The strong Black woman {{ideal is}} a {{long-established}} image in U. S. society pressuring Black women {{to maintain a}} facade of strength at all times. The strength ideal is internalized as an integral aspect of their identity, {{so much so that}} Black women socialize each other to habituate behaviors reflecting strength. The Strong Black Woman Collective Theory (SBWC; Davis, 2015 a) posits that Black women re-appropriate the strong Black woman image and use certain communication behaviors to affirm strength in each other. By exhibiting these behaviors, they delineate a safe space to promote solidarity within the group and confront oppressors collectively. This new theory needs to be corroborated with empirical data to examine how the theoretical tenets are actualized in a real-world communication context. To this end, the present study conducts a partial test of the SBWC theory by observing Black women friend groups engage in supportive discussions about racial discrimination. This is an ideal context to test the SBWC theory because the friends are gathering together as a group of same race-gendered persons; they are discussing the wrongdoing of an identifiable external hostility that they are motivated to retreat from and confront; and strength gets reified as a form of support during the conversation. The study advances a path model to represent the empirical associations among four key variables: <b>strength</b> <b>regulation,</b> group identification and solidarity, verbal confrontation, and relational quality with the out-group member. Fifty-two Black women friends groups (three in each) aged 18 - 89 years were sampled but only the data from the support seeker were used for analyses (n = 52). All data were collected in the home of one of the participants as a way to observe the supportive conversation in a safe, naturalistic environment. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the Strong Black Woman Collective path model. The findings revealed that <b>strength</b> <b>regulation</b> was positively associated with group identification/solidarity, such that women felt more connected to the group when strength was regulated and reinforced. Also verbal derogation was inversely associated with relational satisfaction with the White woman aggressor. That is, support seekers reported lower levels of relational satisfaction with the White woman after she was verbally derogated during the discussion. The results also showed that <b>strength</b> <b>regulation</b> was positively correlated with verbal derogation, even though the relationship was approaching significance. Finally, verbal derogation had a very weak and nonsignificant association with group identification/solidarity. Findings from this study demonstrate that strength is functional in the context of Black women’s communication spaces and has important implications for their relationships with in-group affiliates and outsiders. The conclusion of this dissertation discusses the implications of these findings in relation to future articulations of the SBWC theory, extent research in Feminist Studies and Communication, and Black women’s day-to-day encounters with discrimination...|$|R
