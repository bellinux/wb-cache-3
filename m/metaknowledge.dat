50|$|The {{category}} {{medical knowledge}} consists of statements of spatio-temporally localized facts, general hypotheses, and theories. Sadegh-Zadeh has proposed an elaborate systematics {{of all types}} of medical hypotheses and knowledge the latter ones including classificatory knowledge, causal knowledge, experimental knowledge, theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge, clinical knowledge, and medical <b>metaknowledge.</b> Most important among them is what is called practical knowledge or know-how in medicine. By a formally precise explication of this knowledge type he shows that medical-practical knowledge actually consists of conditional norms, i.e., deontic conditionals, mainly conditional obligations. This {{is one of the reasons}} why Sadegh-Zadeh considers medicine a deontic discipline. Specifically, he views clinical practice as practiced morality because clinical decision-making is nothing but the application of conditional obligations of which diagnostic-therapeutic rules of action primarily consist. And since clinical research pursues such rules of action and tries to improve the available ones, it constitutes explorative and normative ethics based on empirical research and experience.|$|E
50|$|A new {{generation}} of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation. Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, such as GitHub, Google+, Confluence, eXo Platform, JIRA, Skype, NetMeeting, WebEx, and synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis. Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base. As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving. <b>Metaknowledge</b> characterizes how knowledge content interacts with its knowledge context in cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional, or global distributed collaboration.|$|E

40|$|In this {{reply to}} Neal and Hesketh {{and to the}} commentators, we argue that {{implicit}} knowledge is partly abstract and can be usefully defined by the criteria of both <b>metaknowledge</b> and intentional control. We suggest that the pattern of dissociations supports a claim of separate implicit and explicit learning modes. According to our characterization, implicit learning leads to knowledge that is not automatically represented as knowledge by the learning process; instead, the presence of knowledge has to be inferred by the subject (partial explicitation) if <b>metaknowledge</b> is gained at all. During explicit learning, knowledge is automatically labeled as knowledge by the learning process, so that <b>metaknowledge</b> comes immediately and to the fullest extent. Finally, we suggest that implicit knowledge may to some degree apply regardless of intention...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{begins to}} {{identify}} and characterize the knowledge used by experienced librarians while searching for subject information in online catalogs. Ten experienced librarians performed {{the same set of}} six subject searches in an online catalog. Investigated was the knowledge used to solve retrieval problems. This knowledge represents expertise {{in the use of the}} catalog. Data were collected through the use of think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and structured interviews. Knowledge was defined as knowledge of objects (factual knowledge), knowledge of events (experiential knowledge), knowledge of performance (process knowledge), and <b>metaknowledge.</b> <b>Metaknowledge</b> is the sense of whole derived from the integration of factual, process, and experiential knowledge about the search and the conditions under which it is performed. The focus of this paper is on <b>metaknowledge.</b> For evidence of <b>metaknowledge</b> the data were examined for explanations that participants gave for their actions and observations, and for ways that participants evaluated their own progress during the process of searching.

40|$|Abstract Knowledge coordination, that is, {{the process}} of locating, transferring, and {{integrating}} the specialized knowledge of multiple individuals, is a critical prerequisite for organizations to make fuller use {{of one of their}} most important resources: the knowledge of their employees. Yet, knowledge coordination is as challenging as it is important. This dissertation aims to further our understanding of how groups and larger collectives process information and integrate their knowledge and what factors influence the social interactions at the core of this process. The three empirical studies contained in this dissertation examine the role of individuals’ <b>metaknowledge</b> - the knowledge of who knows what - in knowledge coordination processes. Findings from the first two studies indicate that individuals who have an above-average level of <b>metaknowledge</b> can {{play a critical role in}} catalysing information processing and decision making in teams as well as in helping to integrate knowledge between organizational groups. The third study furthermore elucidates the role of formal rank in shaping informal organizational networks through which employees seek knowledge as well as <b>metaknowledge.</b> The findings presented in this dissertation contribute to research on group cognition, knowledge integration within and between groups, and intra-organizational networks. Most importantly, together these studies underscore the importance of taking into account differences in individuals’ <b>metaknowledge</b> in creating a better understanding of knowledge coordination in organizations...|$|E

Relatively little attention has thus far been devoted to representing the kinds of design 2 ̆ 7 <b>metaknowledge</b> 2 ̆ 7 needed to manage the important interface issues that arise in concurrent design, that is, multidisciplinary design decision-making. This paper provides a view of the process and management of concurrent design and evaluates the potential of two AI approaches—blackboard architectures and co-operative distributed problem-solving (CDPS) —to model and support the concurrent design of complex artifacts. A discussion of the process of multidisciplinary design highlights elements of both sequential and concurrent design decision-making. We identify several kinds of design <b>metaknowledge</b> used by expert managers to: partition the design task for efficient execution by specialists; set appropriate levels of design conservatism for key subsystem specifications; evaluate, limit and selectively communicate design changes across discipline boundaries; and control the sequence and timing of the key (highly constrained and constraining) design decisions for a given type of artifact. We explore the extent to which blackboard and CDPS architectures can provide valid models of and potential decision support for concurrent design by (1) representing design management <b>metaknowledge,</b> and (2) using it to enhance both horizontal (interdisciplinary) and vertical (project life cycle) integration among product design, manufacturing and operations specialists...|$|E

40|$|In this work, I view {{incremental}} {{experiential learning}} in intelligent software agents as progressive agent self-adaptation. When an agent produces an incorrect behavior, then it may reflect on, and thus diagnose and repair, the reasoning and knowledge {{that produced the}} incorrect behavior. In particular, I focus on the self-diagnosis and self-repair of an agent's domain knowledge. The implementation of systems with the capability to self-diagnose and self-repair involves building both reasoning processes capable of such learning and knowledge representations capable of supporting those reasoning processes. The core issue my dissertation addresses is: what kind of <b>metaknowledge</b> (knowledge about knowledge) may enable the agent to diagnose faults in its domain knowledge? In providing {{a solution to this}} issue, the central contribution of this research is a theory of the kind of <b>metaknowledge</b> that enables a system to reason about and adapt its conceptual knowledge. For this purpose, I propose a representation that explicitly encodes <b>metaknowledge</b> in the form of procedures called Empirical Verification Procedures (EVPs). In the proposed knowledge representation, an EVP is associated with each concept within the agent's domain knowledge. Each EVP explicitly semantically grounds the associated concept in the agent's perception, and can thus be used as a test to determine the validity of knowledge of that concept during diagnosis. I present the formal and empirical evaluation of a system, Augur, that makes use of EVP <b>metaknowledge</b> to adapt its own domain knowledge {{in the context of a}} particular subclass of classification problem that I call compositional classification, in which the overall classification task can be broken into a hierarchically organized set of subtasks. I hypothesize that EVP <b>metaknowledge</b> will enable a system to automatically adapt its knowledge in two ways: first, by adjusting the ways that inputs are categorized by a concept, in accordance with semantics fixed by an associated EVP; and second, by adjusting the semantics of concepts themselves when they fail to contribute appropriately to system goals. The latter adaptation is realized by altering the EVP associated with the concept in question. I further hypothesize that the semantic grounding of domain concepts in perception through the use of EVPs will increase the generalization power of a learner that operates over those concepts, and thus make learning more efficient. Beyond the support of these hypotheses, I also present results pertinent to the understanding of learning in compositional classification settings using structured knowledge representations. Ph. D.

40|$|The correct {{interpretation}} of biomedical texts by text mining systems requires {{the recognition of}} a range of types of high-level information (or meta-knowledge) about the text. Examples include expressions of negation and speculation, as well as pragmatic/rhetorical intent (e. g. whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, generally accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc.) Although such types of information have previously been annotated at the text-span level (most commonly sentences), annotation {{at the level of the}} event is currently quite sparse. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of the multi-dimensional annotation scheme that we have developed specifically for enriching bio-events with meta-knowledge information. Our annotation scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with different types of bio-event annotation, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the <b>metaknowledge</b> expressed in the text. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the field with regards to the diversity of <b>metaknowledge</b> aspects annotated for each event, whilst the evaluation results have confirmed its feasibility and soundness. ...|$|E

Exploring the relative contribution of linguistic knowledge (grammar, vocabulary and orthography) and metacognitive knowledge at the writer’s resource level and the speed of processing at the writer’s process level to writing proficiency across L 1 and L 1, they collected data from 281 grade 8 students using writing tasks to measure L 1 and L 2 proficiency; tests on grammar, vocabulary, orthography, and <b>metaknowledge</b> to assess the writer’s resources in the memory; and speed of lexical retrieval and sentence building to measure the writers’ fluency in accessing linguistic knowledge. Their study claimed that L 2 linguistic tests highly correlated with L 2 writing proficiency than L 1 linguistic tests with L 1 writing proficiency did. Also, the comparison of the contributions of knowledge tests (linguistic and <b>metaknowledge)</b> vis-a-vis speed of processing, showed that speed of processing, although correlated to writing proficiency, had almost no unique contribution in predicting writing proficiency in L 1 and L 2.|$|E

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and empirical motivation for a learning progression for scientific modeling that aims to make the practice accessible and meaningful for learners. We define scientific modeling as including {{the elements of the}} practice (constructing, using, evaluating, and revising scientific models) and the <b>metaknowledge</b> that guides and motivates the practice (e. g., understanding the nature and purpose of models). Our learning progression for scientific modeling includes two dimensions that combine <b>metaknowledge</b> and elements of practice—scientific models as tools for predicting and explaining, and models change as understanding improves. We describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of our progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5 th and 6 th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate that both groups of learners productively engaged in constructing and revising increasingly accurate models that included powerful explanatory mechanisms, and applied these models to make predictions for closely related phenomena. Furthermore, we show how students engaged in modeling practices move along levels of this progression. In particular, students moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and developed increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models as encompassing explanations for multiple aspects of a target phenomenon. They also developed more nuanced reasons to revise models. Finally, w...|$|E
40|$|An {{appreciation}} {{of the extent of}} one’s knowledge has been referred to as <b>metaknowledge</b> and if well developed, this can help students to develop effective learning strategies. Accurate self-assessment can highlight gaps in knowledge and prompt initiatives to address these deficiencies. However previous studies suggest that <b>metaknowledge</b> tends to be poorly developed and the most common finding is that individuals tend to display overconfidence in their knowledge, by overestimating how much they know. This research addresses learning in a higher education environment and focuses specifically on students studying at a large UK business school. It aims to determine their ability to appreciate the extent of their knowledge {{in the context of their}} learning programme and to explore the relationship between this ability and academic performance. The study takes a quantitative approach, employing a research instrument incorporating a multiple choice test related to the participants ’ study programme and an accompanying questionnaire. Having completed data collection, the next stage in the research is to analyse this data to determine whether and the extent to which, respondents display overconfidence in their assessment of their own knowledge.

40|$|The {{argument}} proffered in {{this paper}} is that use of enterprise social networking technologies can increase the accuracy of people’s <b>metaknowledge</b> (knowledge of “who knows what ” and “who knows whom”) at work. The results of a quasi-natural field experiment in which only one of two matched-sample groups within a large financial services firm was given access to the enterprise social networking technology for six months revealed that by making people’s communications with specific partners visible {{to others in the}} organization, the technology enabled observers to become aware of the communications occurring amongst their coworkers and to make inferences about what and whom those coworkers knew based on the contents of the messages they sent and to whom they were sent. Consequently only individuals in the group that used the social networking technology for six months improved the accuracy of their <b>metaknowledge</b> (a 31 % improvement in knowledge of who knows what and an 88 % improvement in knowledge of who knows whom). There were no improvements in the other group over the same time period.
