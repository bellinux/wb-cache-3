40|$|The {{capital of}} Honduras, Tegucigalpa, has {{suffered}} a shortage of piped water, since the 1980 s. The national utility company in charge of supply, SANAA, opted to supply water intermittently, which poses {{a problem for the}} population who cannot afford water storage facilities. Interviews were conducted with the various authori-ties involved in the water sector to reveal why SANAA {{has not been able to}} incorporate new sources of water and therefore satisfy the needs of the growing population. The research revealed that SANAA’s operations have been hindered by the fast and unorganized growth of the city, the failure of other governmental agencies to comply with their mission effi ciently, and also by the intervention of the Central Government in its opera-tions. Stability of SANAA’s <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> between governmental <b>agencies</b> are essential for the effi cient operation and long-term planning of and investment in the water sector...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in late July and {{continuing}} through mid September 2006 the Paso del Norte region, consisting of El Paso City and County, Texas, southern New Mexico and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, experienced {{a number of}} record high precipitation events and severe localized and widespread flooding. According to the National Weather service, the July 31 to August 4 rains alone were more like a 100 - 150 year recurring event over the areas hardest hit. These floods that continued {{over a period of}} more than a month caused extensive and costly damage to infrastructure, homes, businesses and other property to the extent the region was declared a Federal Disaster Area. In this bi-national, three state region many different Federal agencies and other organizations have jurisdiction or roles in forecasting climate and river flows, monitoring hydrology, water management operations, flood control design and construction, security, infrastructure, communication and disaster assistance. Congressman Silvestre Reyes convened this Federal Flood Assessment Conference to tap into the recent experiences regarding levels of <b>coordination</b> between federal <b>agencies</b> during this month's flood control operations in the Hatch/Las Cruces area of southern New Mexico and the El Paso/Juarez area of West Texas. This meeting between the federal water management agencies was foreseen as timely and important for reviewing the effects of the storm and to offer recommendations for needed changes and improvements. Valuable information was shared at the conference that will greatly assist in assessing the flood events, improving <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> among federal <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> mitigating future impacts. Insight gained from the conference and the follow up summary reports contained in the proceedings will also help lay the groundwork for future planning <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> with state <b>and</b> local agencies, irrigation districts and other organizations. One of Congressman Reyes? desired outcomes from the conference is a proceedings report containing summaries of each organization?s observations, responses and recommendations regarding the area?s flood events. This conference proceedings and recommendation report contains a summary of priority agency and organization recommendations, conference agenda, list of participants, individual agency follow up reports identifying the agency responsibilities, flood event impacts from the agency perspective, agency actions, lessons learned, communication successes, full list of agency priority recommendations, identification of planned incident reports and agency contact information. Infrastructure funding, improved communication, river and levee maintenance, and the need for additional weather and gauging stations, telemetry and coordinated or centralized access to real-time monitoring data are among the highest priority recommendations. A summary of common priority recommendations follows this section. A more complete list of agency and organization priority recommendations is provided following the individual agency reports. The report also includes agency conference Power Point presentations and as additional background, maps showing gauging station locations and monitoring organizations...|$|R

50|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the <b>Management</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Agency</b> in 1983 found that there were 34.75 million occupied dwellings in Japan, of which 46.1% were built of timber, 31.3% of fireproof timber, and 22.6% of ferroconcrete or other nontimber materials. The same survey found that detached housing accounted for 64.3% off all housing in Japan, with the ratio falling in urban areas. In the 23 wards of Tokyo, for instance, multi-unit structures such as apartment houses accounted for 62.5% of all housing in those wards. In terms of tenure, 62.4% of housing in Japan consisted of owner-occupied dwellings, 24.3% of units leased by the private sector, 7.6% of units leased by the public sector, and 5.2% of housing for government workers and company employees.|$|E

50|$|As {{might be}} expected, these {{socioeconomic}} changes have affected workers' attitudes. Prior to World War II, surveys {{indicated that the}} aspect of life regarded as most worthwhile was work. During the 1980s, {{the percentage of people}} who felt this way was declining. Workers' identification with their employers was weakening as well. A survey by the <b>Management</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Agency</b> revealed that a record 2.7 million workers changed jobs in the one-year period beginning October 1, 1986, and the ratio of those who switched jobs to the total labor force matched the previous high recorded in 1974 (one year after the first oil crisis). This survey also showed that the percentage of workers indicating an interest in changing jobs increased from 4.5 percent in 1971 to 9.9 percent in 1987.|$|E
40|$|At {{the outset}} of the 1980 s, Japan was {{subjected}} to increased public demand to eliminate the massive fiscal deficits of the country. This {{was the result of a}} long period of slow economic which began in 1973 when the country was hit by an unexpected oil crisis. The administrative system had expanded rapidly during the high-growth periods from late 1950 s to early 1970 s and an increasing proportion of Japanese citizens wanted the Government to undertake a substantial overhaul of public administration from an integrated and long term perspective as a critical measure to alleviate the problem. Against this background, the Second Provisional Commission on Administrative Reform (PCAR) was established in 1981. PCAR tried to implement administrative reform while conforming to a basic posture of “public finance reconstruction without a tax hike. ” In resolving the issue, PCAR proposed several measures for administra-tive reform, including basic reconsideration of systems, policies and spheres of administrative responsibility. As a concrete follow-up to PCAR’s report, the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform (PCPAR) was convened during three different periods over the next several years. Each meeting resulted in proposals to create systems which would promote future administrative reform. These programmes delineated a basic direction for administrative system reform into the 21 st century. Since this time the Government has considered administrative reform one of the most important issues facing the nation’s public administration. It has put the utmost priority on the PCPAR reports. It has determined specific policies (the Fundamental Principles of Administrative Reform, decided in advance of the preparation of a draft budget at the end of each year) to guide implementation of reforms. Moreover, the Government has submitted necessary legislation to the Diet (the Japanese legislature) and revised administrative ordinances based on these policies. Some of the major results since the establishment of PCAR (from 1981 to 1997) include: (1) privatizing three major public corporations such as the Japanese National Railways; (2) eliminating 45, 388 positions in the national government; (3) strengthening of overall coordination mechanisms (e. g., establishing the <b>Management</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Agency</b> i...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze the food consumption patterns and to conduct econometric analysis of food demand structure in Japan. In this study, we pay special attention to the questions on whether or not rice is an inferior good as previous researchers have so claimed and to what extent Japanese food consumption pattern has been westernized. We use the cross-sectional household data, Annual Report on the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) in 1997 compiled by the Statistics Bureau, <b>Management</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Agency</b> in Japan. For major 11 food items, the total number of observations used for estimation is 95, 223. Food items are non-glutinous rice, bread, noodle, fresh fish, and shellfish, fresh meat, milk, eggs, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, fats and oil, and food away from home. For meat items, the total number of observations used for estimation is 94, 200, and items in interest are beef, pork, poultry, ground meat, ham, sausage, and bacon. In order to deal with the zero-consumption problem associated with household-level microdata, we apply various single equation models: Working-Leser model estimated by OLS, Heckman’s sample selection model, and Tobit mode. For a complete demand system analysis, we apply the linearly approximated almost ideal demand system (LA/AIDS). Additionally, we apply the nonlinear almost ideal demand (AIDS) system. Empirical results from the major 11 food items show that the expenditure elasticity of rice is positive and close to one. This proves that rice consumed in Japan is a normal good, contrary to the results from preceding studies. Marshallian uncompensated and Hicksian compensated own-price elasticities for rice are highly elastic in all models; on the other hand, the own price elasticity for meat is relatively price inelastic. Fresh meats and rice are mild complements in all models; however, fresh fish and rice show the mixed results with repect to their substitution pattern. Results from meat items show that the expenditure elasticity of beef is greater than unity, while other meat products are inelastic. Additionally, the expenditure and price elasticities look very similar to that of Western nations. This study shows that the Japanese meat consumption pattern has become westernized.
