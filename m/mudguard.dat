5|$|In 1984, Honda {{released}} restyled {{versions of}} the Cubs on some markets, with square lamps and plastic-covered handlebars and rear <b>mudguard.</b> On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub.|$|E
25|$|In early July, Obregón moved {{south to}} Orendaín, Jalisco, where his troops {{defeated}} federal troops, leaving 8000 dead, {{and making it}} clear that the Huerta regime was defeated. Obregón was promoted to major general. He continued his march south. Upon Obregón's arrival in Teoloyucan, Mexico State, it was clear that Huerta was defeated, and, on 11 August, on the <b>mudguard</b> of a car, Obregón signed the treaties that ended the Huerta regime. On 16 August 1914, Obregón and 18,000 of his troops marched triumphantly into Mexico City. He was joined shortly by Carranza, who marched triumphantly into Mexico City on 20 August.|$|E
2500|$|Motorcycles {{formerly}} had {{to display}} a front plate, which was usually but not always a double-sided plate {{on top of the}} front <b>mudguard,</b> curved to follow the contour of the wheel and visible from the sides. The requirement for the front number plate was dropped in 1975 because of the severe danger these presented to pedestrians {{in the event of a}} collision; this risk had prompted the slang term [...] "pedestrian slicer" [...] for the plates. Motorcycles registered after 1 September 2001 may only display a rear number plate, while motorcycles registered before that date can display a number plate at the front if desired.|$|E

50|$|The Sd.Kfz. 234 series were {{completely}} new designs, {{of a similar}} size and appearance to the Sd.Kfz. 231 family that they replaced. They were powered by a Tatra diesel. The most obvious external difference is the single-piece <b>mudguards</b> compared to the two-piece <b>mudguards</b> on the 232 series.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 13,102 Austin K2/Y {{ambulances}} (the front <b>mudguards</b> ended at the 'doors') were {{built at the}} company's Longbridge plant almost continuously from 1940 until the war ended. An estimated 50 or more remain today. The Austin chassis {{was one of three}} main designs fitted with Mann Egerton bodies, the others being Morris Commercial CS11/30F (the front <b>mudguards</b> ended underneath the rungs) and Bedford ML 54 (the front <b>mudguards</b> ended before the 'doors'). It is estimated there are two remaining Morris Commercials, but no Bedford examples are said to survive.|$|R
2500|$|From October 1939 the K-M20 was {{designated}} the W-M20 and modified to include girder-forks and {{removal of the}} valanced rear <b>mudguard.</b> [...] During late 1940 some civil specification M20s were purchased by the War Office which were civil models with a military paint scheme. In 1941 front and rear number plates were removed and between 1941 and 1942 active service use in North Africa showed the need for easy adjustment of the fork dampers. Special damper knobs were made of bakelite (later replaced with pressed steel). The DU142 headlight was replaced with a smaller 6 in Lucas DU42, with a hooded, slotted black-out shield, and a universal L-WD-MCT1A tail light was fitted.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} prototype, a large {{proportion}} of the Minicar was made from different aluminium alloys. The main body was a very simple construction of 18swg sheet with a 14swg main bulkhead. The integrity of the main stressed skin structure was enhanced by the absence of doors, the bodysides being deemed low enough to be stepped over without major inconvenience (unless you were wearing a skirt). Most of the bodywork panels were flat or fairly simple curves whilst the compound curves of the bonnet and rear <b>mudguard</b> arches were pressed out as separate panels. The windscreen was made from Perspex. The car was alleged to weigh only [...] “all-in” or [...] dry and its light weight was regularly demonstrated by one person lifting the entire rear end of the car off the ground unaided. A test run between Preston and London at an average speed of [...] gave an average fuel consumption of [...] for the journey.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} {{painstakingly}} restored by enthusiasts to accurate wartime specification, the M20 has also been developed by specialists for speed trials. A 1938 BSA M20 ridden by Bill Jenkins from Dallas achieved {{a top speed of}} 108mph at Bonneville Salt Flats making it the fastest M20 for this venue in the world. The original side-valve engine was extensively modified and fuelled with nitrous oxide. [...] The intake port fed by the carburetor, originally horizontal, was re-drilled at a steep angle into the cylinder casting so it pointed up at the underside of the intake valve. The motorcycle did however retain the long BSA prop stand that hinged under the seat and clipped to the rear <b>mudguard</b> when not in use [...] so it looked like a stock M20. [...] In October 1995 an M20 fitted with a BSA Gold Star [...] crankshaft sprocket and running on a 95% methanol / 5% acetone mix ridden by Pat Jeal achieved a terminal speed of 112mph at the disused airfield of RAF Elvington, Yorkshire.|$|E
