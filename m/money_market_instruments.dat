5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instruments.</b> The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E

40|$|Large {{banks and}} dealers use and reuse {{collateral}} pledged by nonbanks, which helps lubricate {{the global financial}} system. The supply of collateral arises from specific investment strategies in the asset management complex, with the primary providers being hedge funds, pension funds, insurers, official sector accounts, <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> and others. Post-Lehman, {{there has been a}} significant decline in the source collateral for the large dealers that specialize in intermediating pledgeable collateral. Since collateral can be reused, the overall effect (i. e., reduced ?source'' of collateral times the velocity of collateral) may have been a $ 4 - 5 trillion reduction in collateral. This decline in financial lubrication likely has impact on the conduct of global monetary policy. And recent regulations aimed at financial stability, focusing on building equity and reducing leverage at large banks/dealers, may also reduce financial lubrication in the nonbank/bank nexus.

40|$|We {{consider}} a passive investor who divides his capital between two assets: a risk-free <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> and an index fund, or an exchange-traded fund, tracking a broad market index. We model {{the evolution of}} the market index by a lognormal diffusion. The agent faces both fixed and proportional transaction costs and solvency constraints. The objective is to maximize the expected utility from the portfolio liquidation at a fixed horizon, but if the portfolio reaches a pre-set target value, then the position in the risky asset is liquidated. The model is formulated as a parabolic impulse control problem and we characterize the value function as the unique constrained viscosity solution of the associated quasi-variational inequality. We show the existence of an impulse policy which is arbitrarily close to the optimal one by reducing the model to a sequence of iterated optimal stopping problems. The value function and the quasi-optimal policy are computed numerically by an iterative finite element discretization technique. We present extended numerical results {{in the case of a}} constant relative risk aversion utility function, showing the non-stationary shape of the optimal strategy and how it varies with respect to the model parameters. The numerical experiments reveal that, even with small transaction costs and distant horizons, the optimal strategy is essentially a buy-and-hold trading strategy where the agent recalibrates his portfolio very few times...|$|R

40|$|Between September 1998 and Spring 1999 the {{liquidity}} of the Hungarian inter-bank <b>money</b> <b>market</b> and {{the corresponding}} interest rates for overnight funds showed significantly larger fluctuations relative to the previous periods. This study aims to analyse the causes behind the imbalances experienced during this period, and also to draw some lessons for monetary policy and operations. Fluctuations in overnight interest rates are largely irrelevant for monetary policy unless they spill over to longer maturities as well. This usually does not happen, however, as our econometric results show, in the period considered fluctuations in liquidity had a considerable impact on the 3 -month inter-bank interest rate. The hectic fluctuations in liquidity were {{partly due to the}} Russian crisis and to the changes implemented in the MNB's set of monetary instruments. However, deficiencies in the commercial banks' liquidity management also contributed to the market turbulence. The analysis of market data revealed several occasions where market players behaved irrationally, and such behaviour resulted in long-lasting periods of disequilibrium on the <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> Reducing the maturity of the MNB's key policy instrument from one month to two weeks alleviated the fluctuations in liquidity; however, it could not resolve the problems arising from the inherent inefficiency of the inter-bank <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> monetary <b>instruments,</b> operational framework, averaging, overnight interest rates. ...|$|R

Monetary authorities must prevent one-sided positions in the currency, favor asset substitutability, and incorporate the enriched information set provided by derivative-based transactions into monetary policy design. In some circumstances, the use of derivatives by monetary authorities may help fulfill this role.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the sizable role of rehypothecation {{in the shadow}} banking system. Rehypothecation is the practice that allows collateral posted by, say, a hedge fund to its prime broker to be used again as collateral by that prime broker for its own funding. In the United Kingdom, such use of a customer’s assets by a prime broker can be for an unlimited amount of the customer’s assets while in the United States rehypothecation is capped. Incorporating estimates for rehypothecation (and the associated re-use of collateral) in the recent crisis indicates that the collapse in non-bank funding to banks was sizable. We show that the shadow banking system was at least 50 percent bigger than documented so far. We also provide estimates from the hedge fund industry for the - churning - factor or re-use of collateral. From a policy angle, supervisors of large banks that report on a global consolidated basis may need to enhance {{their understanding of the}} off-balance sheet funding that these banks receive via rehypothecation from other jurisdictions.
