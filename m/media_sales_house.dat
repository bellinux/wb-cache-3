40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{contribute}} to a better understanding of the day-to-day activities of CRM and <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> as social practices in the context of media convergence. This study has two main objectives. First, it aims to characterize the key customer relationships of <b>media</b> <b>sales.</b> Second, it aims to identify the social practices of <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> and examine how these practices enable or constrain customer orientation. The empirical study is conducted in a Finnish media organization which is transforming its sales operation model towards more customer-oriented as a response to the challenges introduced by media convergence. The changes in the media environment and within the organization have profound implications on how <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> work is carried out and how customer relationships are managed, providing a current and interesting case context. Research objectives are approached through a qualitative case study. The empirical data consists of nine thematic interviews in total, four of which were conducted in one of the <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> units of the case organization. Five interviews were conducted among customers of the <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> unit. The theoretical framework builds primarily on practice theory in social sciences and literature on media management, drawing also on customer relationship management literature. The practice perspective provides an interpretive lens through which attention is directed to the collectively shared norms, traditions, understandings, procedures and routines that seem to guide the everyday activities of marketing practitioners. Overall, the case study provided a detailed view of the practical complexities of <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> in the context of media convergence. Based on the empirical analysis four social practices of <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> are identified. The practices of relationship management, steering, collaborating, and developing describe the underlying background understandings and the bodily activities that make up <b>media</b> <b>sales.</b> The study suggests that these interrelated practices consist of both enabling and constraining features towards customer orientation. Although the case organization has taken measures to enhance customer orientation, it was found that the old product-oriented logic is mediated through established, culturally and historically transmitted social practices...|$|R

40|$|Objectives of the thesis: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to discover whether Otavamedia, a Finnish media company, can utilize its' publicly listed competitors' shares {{as a tool of}} risk management for its <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow. The risk associated with <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow is the inevitable effect it has on shareholders' funds available for distribution. The advantage the company has is the advance knowledge of media advertising growth, which is generally found to be vastly cyclical and volatile. This information would by the assumptions of this paper, provide the company with a predictor on the future growth of its competing companies' share prices. The study proposes that a combination of securities could then be found which would offset a significant amount of Otavamedia's <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow volatility and deliver additional cash flows. The testing process was designed so {{that it would not be}} overly focused, but rather a wide set of parameters were included to broaden the scope of the study. Different portfolio variations, adjustment intervals, hedging strategies, regression models, and data lag times are all cross-inspected to find out which combinations provide best outcomes. Data: The data consists of internal <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow figures of Otavamedia, its competitors share price data, the main Finnish market indexes, and three control variables. The monthly <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flows are from January 1998 through December 2012, and all other data are retrieved for the same period. Apart from the <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow, the data is daily, but due to the dependent variable being on a monthly level, the timeframe inspected in the study is explicitly monthly. Main findings: The main findings of the thesis are that indeed Otavamedia can partly lower its risk to <b>media</b> <b>sales</b> cash flow volatility by constructing the proposed risk management mechanisms. Both lowered volatility and improved cash flows are reported, but their economic significance to the case company remains questionable. The suggested alternate strategies on hedging were not found beneficial, but rather that the simple and straightforward hedging method proved best results...|$|R
