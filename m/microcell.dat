40|$|An {{alternative}} {{technique for}} the fabrication of disposable electrochemical <b>microcells</b> containing working, reference and auxiliary electrodes {{on a single}} device is reported. The procedure is based on thermal-transfer of toner masks onto CD-R (recordable compact discs) gold surfaces to define {{the layout of the}} electrodes (contour). In a subsequent step, the layout is manually painted with a permanent marker pen. The unprotected gold surface is conveniently etched (chemical corrosion) and the ink is then easily removed with ethanol, generating gold surfaces without contamination. The final and reproducible area of the electrodes is defined by heat transference of a second toner mask. Silver epoxy is deposited on one of the gold bands which is the satisfactorily used as reference electrode. These <b>microcells</b> were electrochemically characterized by cyclic, linear, and square wave voltammetry, and several electroactive species were used as model systems. The area reproducibility of the electrodes for different <b>microcells</b> was studied and a relative standard deviation better than 1, 0 % (n = 10) was obtained. Disposable electrochemical <b>microcells</b> were successfully used in analysis of liquid samples with volumes lower than 200 µL and good stability and reproducibility (RSD less than 2. 0 %) were achieved.

40|$|In this paper, the {{downlink}} sector {{capacity of}} a cigar-shaped <b>microcells</b> using wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA) with soft hand-over (SHO) mode is analyzed. The two-slope propagation loss with log-normal shadowing {{is used in the}} analysis where a model of eight cigar-shaped <b>microcells</b> is utilized to calculate the downlink sector capacity. The performance of the downlink is studied for different sector radii, standard deviations of the shadowing and propagation exponents. It is found that, for a sector range higher than 940 m, increasing the sector range will reduce the downlink sector capacity. Also it is found that increasing the value of the propagation parameters will reduce the downlink sector capacity. In many cases, the downlink sector capacity will be code limited since the theoretical downlink sector capacity is higher than the number of codes assigned to each sector. The high theoretical downlink sector capacity is due to the low value (0. 06 – 0. 1) of the WCDMA orthogonality factor of rural zone <b>microcells...</b>|$|R
