5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than <b>material</b> <b>conditions.</b> He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the {{developing}} theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance {{in a cultural}} context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and <b>material</b> <b>conditions</b> may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography.

She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the <b>material</b> <b>conditions</b> of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E

[...] Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of economic stagnation; it was in this decade that the number of Libyan defectors increased. Gaddafi claimed that his Jamahiriya was a [...] "concrete utopia", and that he had been appointed by [...] "popular assent", with some Islamic supporters believing that he exhibited barakah. His opposition to Western governments earned him the respect of many in the Euro-American far right, with the UK-based National Front for instance embracing aspects of the Third International Theory during the 1980s. His anti-Western stance also attracted praise from the far left; in 1971, the Soviet Union awarded him the Order of Lenin, although his mistrust of atheist Marxism prevented him from attending the ceremony in Moscow. First noted that, during the early 1970s, various students at the Paris 8 University were hailing Gaddafi as [...] "the only Third World leader with any real stomach for struggle".|$|E

40|$|Utilization of America's {{substantial}} coal reserves {{for energy}} production {{has become a}} national priority. Advanced coal-fired power plants offer an environmentally friendly means to achieve that goal. These power plants, such as ultrasupercritical power plants, will provide high thermal efficiency along with greatly reduced emissions of CO[subscript 2] and other pollutants. Life cycle costs for the advanced coal-fired plants can be reduced by enhanced observability in support of condition-based maintenance. The enhanced observability {{can be achieved by}} using networks of condition-monitoring sensors that would provide component-level <b>material</b> <b>condition</b> information and through-wall temperature monitoring. This would reduce uncertainties in knowledge of <b>material</b> <b>condition,</b> at the level of individual components, and improve capability to predict remaining life of critical components. One approach being developed under the U. S. Department of Energy Small Business Innovation Research Program is to develop and implement high-temperature versions of the meandering winding magnetometer (HT-MWM) for temperatures up to 1000 degC.

2500|$|Material {{feminism}} highlights {{capitalism and}} patriarchy as central in understanding women's oppression. Under materialist feminism, gender {{is seen as}} a social construct, and society forces gender roles, such as bearing children, onto women. Materialist feminism's ideal vision is a society in which women are treated socially and economically the same as men.The theory centers on social change rather than seeking transformation within the capitalist system. Jennifer Wicke, defines materialist feminism as [...] "a feminism that insists on examining the <b>material</b> <b>conditions</b> under which social arrangements, including those of gender hierarchy, develop... materialist feminism avoids seeing this gender hierarchy as the effect of a singular... patriarchy and instead gauges the web of social and psychic relations that make up a material, historical moment". She states that [...] "...materialist feminism argues that <b>material</b> <b>conditions</b> of all sorts {{play a vital role in}} the social production of gender and assays the different ways in which women collaborate and participate in these productions". Material feminism also considers how women and men of various races and ethnicities are kept in their lower economic status due to an imbalance of power that privileges those who already have privilege, thereby protecting the status quo. Materialist feminists ask whether people have access to free education, if they can pursue careers, have access or opportunity to become wealthy, and if not, what economic or social constraints are preventing them from doing so, and how this can be changed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{view that}} wage work has {{substantial}} similarities with chattel slavery was actively put {{forward in the}} late 18th and 19th centuries by defenders of chattel slavery (most notably in the Southern states of the US), and by opponents of capitalism (who were also critics of chattel slavery). Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the Southern slave states argued that Northern workers were [...] "free but in name – the slaves of endless toil," [...] and that their slaves were better off.

Due to the specific focus on the subjective aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude objective conditions such as <b>material</b> <b>conditions</b> or health, although these can influence ratings of SWB. Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of pleasure versus pain in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a good life. Components of SWB relating to affect include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as [...] "overall affect" [...] or [...] "hedonic balance", defined as the overall equilibrium [...] between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.
