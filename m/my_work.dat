5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important.

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>works</b> are mirrors {{that reflect}} my life, my thoughts, {{my heart and}} my soul. Since <b>my</b> <b>works</b> are about <b>my</b> {{experience}} and reactions toward my life, cultural differences {{between east and west}} culture have a tremendous impact on <b>my</b> <b>works.</b> Moving to America was a turning point to me these years. The surrounding is totally different and everything is new to me. I found that I’m not only learning art but also learning how to live in a foreign place. Once my life was occupied by these unknown things, <b>my</b> <b>works</b> manifest every emotions I have in every moment. This is not me trying to unify art and life, It is them integrating with each other spontaneously. Somehow I think that art is life, and life is art...|$|R

5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> as an Author.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} {{conceptual}} reading and the process for <b>my</b> <b>works</b> that I have produced in the two-year-period of my master's degree. The main theme of <b>my</b> <b>works</b> is the concept of "performativity" on the social and cultural construction of identity, which is examined in terms of gender roles, nationalism and health. The notion of "believing" comes out as the focal point when analyzing and defining these concepts. Most of <b>my</b> <b>works</b> try to question the normalization of the subtle and constantly repeated inured notions and the role they play in the formation of one's identity...|$|R

I inject <b>my</b> <b>works</b> with a realism that exposes this socio-political economic monster, allowing people a chance to recognise the danger of over indulgence in this form of negative consumption." ...|$|R
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on <b>my</b> <b>work,</b> and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} {{complementary}} text quality aims at offering textual basis of <b>my</b> five <b>works</b> (four experimental videos and one audio-visual installation) {{produced in the}} last two years within the framework of the concepts such as time, memory, experience, home movie and experimental video through interpreting these. All concepts discussed have been attempted to be explained/given a meaning particularly in the context of photograph and moving image, and then, <b>my</b> <b>works</b> have been interpreted over these concepts. In the core of <b>my</b> <b>works,</b> there lie concepts of experience and performativity, and time and memory that I believe to constitute the base of the former two. In <b>my</b> <b>works</b> I attempted to create a different meaning and perception by combining together the images I collected generally via several media (video, photograph, sound). Thus, by being abstracted from their contexts through the process, these personal images, which could merely be a memory, document, representation of reality, gain some qualities to provide opportunities for various interpretations...|$|R

He also made arrangements for their clothing and daily food, appointing ministers and guardians to take all measures so that nothing should be lacking for them.|$|E
25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> as an Author, {{he explained that}} the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.|$|E

Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience.
