5000|$|Punching is a {{metal forming}} process {{that uses a}} punch press to force a tool, called a punch, through the {{workpiece}} to create a hole via shearing. The punch often passes through the work into a die. A scrap slug from the hole is deposited into the die in the process. Depending on the material being punched this slug may be recycled and reused or discarded. Punching is often the cheapest method for creating holes in sheet metal in medium to high production volumes. When a specially shaped punch is used to create multiple usable parts from a sheet of material the process is known as blanking. In forging applications the work is often punched while hot, and this is called hot punching.Slugging- It is the operation of punching in which punch is stopped {{as soon as the}} <b>metal</b> <b>fracture</b> is complete and metal is not removed but held in hole ...|$|E
40|$|The useful {{information}} extracted from fracture images {{is the most}} fundamental problem of quantitative analysis and intelligent diagnosis of <b>metal</b> <b>fracture.</b> The pattern recognition or classification is the critical issue of failure analysis of <b>metal</b> <b>fracture.</b> In this paper, combining wavelet transform, kurtosis with relevance vector machine (RVM), a new recognition method based on wavelet kurtosis and RVM, which is named wavelet kurtosis-RVM, is proposed.

The proposed method is also compared with the wavelet entropy-RVM recognition method and wavelet kurtosis-SVM recognition method.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} failure modes of thin-walled structures is fracture. Fracture is predominantly tensile in nature and, in most part, is operated by the physical mechanisms of void nucleation, growth, and linkage. For ductile sheet, fracture is preceded by necking. Prediction of necking which limits sheet metal formability is well established and has been developed over the past several decades. However, an in-depth understanding of the mechanical process inside the neck leading to sheet <b>metal</b> <b>fracture</b> is lacking. This is true for both static and high intensity, short duration loads.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} friction welding condition on joining phenomena and joint strength of friction welded joints between copper–zinc alloy (brass) and low carbon steel (LCS). When the joint was made at a friction pressure of 30 MPa with a friction speed of 27 · 5 s− 1, brass transferred to the half radius region of the weld interface on the LCS side. Then, transferred brass extended towards the almost whole weld interface with increasing friction time.

In addition, all joints fractured from the brass base metal with no cracking at the weld interface.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the friction welding condition on the joining phenomena and the tensile strength of friction welded joint between pure titanium (P-Ti) and low carbon steel (LCS). The adjacent region of the weld interface at the P-Ti side was intensely upsetting with accompanied large deformation of itself when the joint had sparkle at both applied friction pressures of 30 and 90 MPa, although that of the LCS side was hardly upset. The temperature of the whole weld interface at a friction pressure of 30 MPa reached to 1150 K or over at a friction time of 3. 0 s or longer. However, the half radius and centreline portion temperatures of the weld interface at a friction pressure of 90 MPa was not reached to 1150 K, although the periphery portion of that was reached to its temperature. The central portion of the weld interface at a friction pressure of 90 MPa was deformed to a convex shape from the viewpoint of the P-Ti side, although that of 30 MPa remained almost flat after when the friction torque reached the initial peak. When the joint was made at a friction pressure of 30 MPa, a friction time of 3. 0 s or longer, and a forge pressure of 270 MPa or higher, it achieved 100 % joint efficiency and the P-Ti base <b>metal</b> <b>fracture</b> with no crack at the weld interface. However, many joints at friction times of 1. 2 and 1. 5 s fractured at the weld interface, although those achieved 100 % joint efficiency, because whole weld interface temperature was below 1150 K. On the other hand, many joints at a friction pressure of 90 MPa with high forge pressure also fractured at the weld interface, although those achieved 100 % joint efficiency, because the weld interface temperature at the half radius and periphery portions was below 1150 K. Those joints did not have the intermetallic compound layer at the weld interface. The difference of the fractured portion of the joint in both applied friction pressures was due to the difference between the maximum temperature at the weld interface during the friction process and the deformation amount of the LCS side caused by applied forge pressure. To obtain 100 % joint efficiency with the P-Ti base <b>metal</b> <b>fracture</b> with no crack at the weld interface, the joint should be made with high forge pressure, low friction pressure, and with opportune friction time at which the temperature at whole weld interface reached around 1150 K...|$|E
