25|$|Given {{conflicting}} {{evidence of the}} costs and benefits of smoking, controversy remains on what the clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental health providers have overlooked smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from significant stress and disability and as such should be allowed to engage in smoking as an activity that is pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental health providers, particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage <b>medication</b> <b>compliance.</b> However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to study the factors associated with attitudes towards psychotropic <b>medications</b> and treatment <b>compliance</b> behaviours among adolescents living in youth care centres. One hundred fifty-one adolescents from youth care centres in five administrative regions of Québec who were receiving at least one psychotropic medication participated in the study. The adolescents, as well as their tutor youth workers, answered questionnaires rating attitudes towards <b>medications,</b> <b>compliance</b> behaviours, coping strategies, symptoms and difficulties, medications prescribed, readiness to change, and the therapeutic relationship with the prescriber. Results show that boys and girls differ significantly with regard to attitudes and behaviours towards psychotropic medication. Among girls, anxiety perceived by the tutor youth worker is the only variable correlated with attitudes towards <b>medications</b> and with <b>compliance</b> behaviours. Among boys, coping strategies type, use of mood stabilizers, a trustworthy relationship with the prescriber, and the nature of the behavioural problems perceived by the tutor youth worker are associated with attitudes towards medications; readiness to change and explicit aggressive behaviours are associated with compliance behaviours. This is an indication that attitudes towards psychotropic medications are linked to gender differences. The practical application from this study is to promise an improved management of young people taking psychotropic medication. Intervention must be tailored to the needs of the individual adolescent and take account of gender differences.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Nearly {{all state}} health {{departments}} collect Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFS) data, and many report using these data {{in public health}} planning. Although the BRFS is widely used, {{little is known about}} its measurement properties. This study compares the cardiovascular risk behavior estimates of the BRFS with estimates derived from the physiological and interview data of the Stanford Five-City Project Survey (FCPS). METHOD. The BRFS is a random telephone sample of 1588 adults aged 25 to 64; the FCPS is a random household sample of 1512 adults aged 25 to 64. Both samples were drawn from the same four California communities. RESULTS. The surveys produced comparable estimates for measures of current smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, rate of ever being told one has high blood pressure, rate of prescription of blood pressure <b>medications,</b> <b>compliance</b> in taking <b>medications,</b> and mean total cholesterol. Significant differences were found for mean body mass index, rates of obesity, and, in particular, rate of controlled hypertension. CONCLUSIONS. These differences indicate that, for some risk variables, the BRFS has limited utility in assessing public health needs and setting public health objectives. A formal validation study is needed to test all the risk behavior estimates measured by this widely used instrument...|$|R

Numbers of strategies to overcome are seemingly not succeeded. Roles and responsibilities of family nursing are crucial to improve participation, motivation of individual, family and community in prevention, including pulmonary tuberculosis. Unfortunately, models of pulmonary tuberculosis currently unavailable. The combination of adaptation and conservation in complementarily improving family support and <b>compliance</b> in <b>medication</b> is introduced in this study. Method: This research intended to analyze Adaptive Conservation Model (ACM) in extending family support and treatment compliance. Modeling steps including model analysis, expert validation, ﬁeld trial, implementation and recommending the output model.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate use of {{antibiotics}} leads to increased levels of bacterial resistance {{making it difficult to}} treat upper respiratory tract infections. The appropriate use of these drugs has a fundamental role in controlling resistance and in success of treatment of childhood infections. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prescription and use {{of antibiotics}} for Brazilian children. METHODS: The {{use of antibiotics}} in 160 children was monitored in two Primary Health Centers by questionnaires administered to parents and caregivers that assessed the social, demographic and clinical conditions of the children. Furthermore, the antibiotic use pattern was ascertained in these children and compared to the recommendations of the Brazilian and international guidelines. RESULTS: The use of these drugs had an inverse relationship with children breast-fed to six months of age, showing that breast-fed children had a tendency to use less of these drugs. There was great variability in the amoxicillin doses used for upper respiratory infections ranging from 8. 2 to 91. 9 mg/kg/day. The doses used in most treatments were far below the doses recommended in the Brazilian and international guidelines (50 % and 97 %, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although there are guidelines for the use of these <b>medications,</b> <b>compliance</b> is still very low, leading to under dosage and therapeutic failures. It is essential for pediatricians to be aware of and comply with the guidelines, avoid personal decisions and take measures based on strong clinical evidence.

40|$|Introduction: The ACute CORonary syndromes Descriptive study (ACCORD) is a {{prospective}} observational study that evaluates {{the management of}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in clinical practice {{and the use of}} antiplatelet agents in acute settings and after discharge. The secondary objective {{of this study was to}} obtain information on risk factors in a large cohort of patients with ACS. Methods: The study population included subjects aged at least 21 years who had unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patients had four follow-up visits over a one-year period. Results: A total of 525 patients from Malaysia were enrolled into the study. The mean age of the patients was 58. 14 +/- 11. 3 years, and the mean body mass index was 25. 4 +/- 4. 3 kg/m 2. 96. 8 percent of subjects had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Following hospitalisation, 83. 6 percent of patients were managed medically. During the follow-up visits, 62. 7 - 77. 6 percent of patients received aspirin only, 5. 0 - 6. 8 percent received clopidogrel only and 15. 6 - 32. 3 percent received dual antiplatelet <b>medications.</b> <b>Compliance</b> with aspirin was 93. 5 - 96. 5 percent.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of individualised, {{reconciled}} evidence-based recommendations (IRERs) and multidisciplinary care in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) on clinical guideline compliance for CHF and common comorbid conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective hospital clinical audit conducted between 1 st July 2006 and February 2011. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 255 patients with a diagnosis of CHF who attended the Multidisciplinary Ambulatory Consulting Services (MACS) clinics, at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance with Australian clinical guideline recommendations for CHF, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease. RESULTS: Study participants had a median of eight medical conditions (IQR 6 - 10) and were on an average of 10 (± 4) unique <b>medications.</b> <b>Compliance</b> with clinical guideline recommendations for pharmacological therapy for CHF, comorbid atrial fibrillation, diabetes or ischaemic heart disease was high, ranging from 86 % for lipid lowering therapy to 98 % anti-platelet agents. For all conditions, compliance with lifestyle recommendations was lower than pharmacological therapy, ranging from no podiatry reviews for CHF patients with comorbid diabetes to 75 % for heart failure education. Concordance with many guideline recommendations was significantly associated if the patient had IRERs determined, a greater number of recommendations, more clinic visits or if patients participated in a heart failure program. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high number of comorbid conditions and resulting complexity of the management, high compliance to clinical guideline recommendations was associated with IRER determination in older patients with CHF. Importantly these recommendations need to be communicated to the patient's general practitioner, regularly monitored and adjusted at clinic visits. Tam H. Ho, Gillian E. Caughey, Sepehr Shaki...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{assess whether}} {{switching}} to insulin therapy {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with <b>medication</b> refill <b>compliance</b> of oral hypoglycemic agents. Research Design and Methods The PHARMO Record Linkage System was used as data source for this study. Patients with newly treated type 2 diabetes mellitus were defined as subjects in whom oral hypoglycemic therapy was initiated between 1991 and 1998. We performed a matched case-control study in this cohort. Cases were patients who switched to insulin therapy. Date of switching in the case {{was defined as the}} index date. Controls were subjects still on oral therapy on the index date, matched on duration of diabetes and calendar time. We measured the <b>medication</b> refill <b>compliance</b> in the year starting 18 months before the index date and calculated various compliance indices. Results In total, 411 cases and 411 matched controls were identified. Cases suffered more often from more severe comorbidity and used a higher number of oral hypoglycemic agents and concomitant non-diabetic drugs. The overall compliance rate did not differ significantly between cases and controls, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1. 3 (CI 95 % 0. 6 - 2. 8). After performing multivariate logistic regression modeling, age at onset of diabetes, gender, comedication, combination therapy, and daily dosage frequency, were independently related to switching. Conclusions We were unable to confirm the hypothesis that noncompliance with treatment is more prevalent in patients with secondary failure. Other variables, like comorbidity and disease-related factors seem to play a more important role in switching to insulin therapy. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
