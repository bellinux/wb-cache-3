5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These are {{attracted}} by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, and upon alighting {{on the plant}} adhere to the sticky drops of mucilage. Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) <b>mucilaginous</b> glands and sessile (flat) {{digestive}} glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a <b>mucilaginous</b> secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
25|$|The dried {{powdered}} bark of Persea nanmu(楠木皮) is {{used extensively}} for its <b>mucilaginous</b> qualities, which helps to bind the other powdered ingredients together.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands, {{the leaves are}} also {{equipped}} with sessile glands, which assumedly {{are responsible for the}} secretion of the digestive juices. Sessile glands are five to ten times as numerous as the stalked glands.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mucilaginous</b> {{inner bark}} of the Slippery Elm Ulmus rubra {{has long been}} used as a demulcent, and is still {{produced}} commercially for this purpose in the United States with approval for sale as a nutritional supplement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
25|$|Seeds of {{many plants}} have evolved {{a variety of}} {{defenses}} to deter predation from seed predators. Plants may allocate resources toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside protective structures or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe. Other physical defenses include spines, hairs, fibrous seed coats and hard endosperm. Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a <b>mucilaginous</b> seed coat that can glue soil to seed hiding it from granivores.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} air or oxygen {{being introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater (wastewater) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of saprotrophic bacteria but also has an important protozoan flora component mainly composed of amoebae, Spirotrichs, Peritrichs including Vorticellids {{and a range of}} other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of <b>mucilaginous</b> filamentous bacteria can develop including Sphaerotilus natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) {{have several}} {{distinguishing}} characteristics that facilitate identification, including thick, white, <b>mucilaginous</b> stipes, and white to pale cream, convex caps that measure [...] The gills are white, widely spaced, {{and have a}} fused or decurrent attachment to the stipe. Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure about 9–15 by 6–9 micrometres. The smooth and white stipes are [...] long and [...] thick, {{and covered with a}} thick coating of gluten.|$|E
500|$|Spores are 26–40 by 10–12µm, elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), {{and have}} small lipid {{droplets}} concentrated at either end. The droplets are refractive to light and visible with light microscopy. In older, dried specimens (such as herbarium material), the droplets may coalesce and hinder {{the identification of}} species. Depending on their geographical origin, the spores may have a delicate <b>mucilaginous</b> sheath or [...] "envelope"; European specimens are devoid of an envelope while specimens from North America invariably have one.|$|E
500|$|Gumbo broth or gravy {{derives from}} three primary thickeners: okra, filé powder, and roux. [...] Traditionally, okra and filé powder {{are not used}} in the same dish, {{although}} this rule is sometimes broken. [...] Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat. [...] This <b>mucilaginous</b> vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to The Oxford Companion to Food, okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as changing tastes have made the okra texture less palatable.|$|E
500|$|Pinguicula moranensis [...] is a {{perennial}} rosette-forming insectivorous herb native to Mexico and Guatemala. [...] A species of butterwort, it forms summer rosettes of flat, succulent leaves up to 10centimeters (4in) long, which {{are covered in}} <b>mucilaginous</b> (sticky) glands that attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey. Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor substrate that the plant grows in. [...] In the winter the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low. [...] Single pink, purple, or violet flowers appear twice a year on upright stalks up to 25 centimeters long.|$|E
500|$|Drosera anglica is a {{perennial}} herb which forms an upright, stemless rosette of generally [...] leaves. As is typical for sundews, the laminae are densely covered with stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands, each tipped {{with a clear}} droplet of a viscous fluid used for trapping insects. The lamina, which is [...] long, is held semi-erect by a long petiole, bringing the total leaf size to 30–95mm. Plants are green, coloring red in bright light. In all populations except those in Kaua'i, D. anglica forms winter resting buds called hibernacula. These consist of a knot of tightly curled leaves at ground level, which unfurl in spring {{at the end of}} the dormancy period. The root system is weak and penetrates only a few centimeters, serving mainly as an anchor and for water absorption. Nitrogen is in short supply in bogs and trapping and digesting insects provides an alternate source.|$|E
500|$|P. moranensis is {{seasonally}} dimorphic, {{in that it}} undergoes {{two distinct}} growth habits throughout the year. [...] During the summer when rain and insect prey are most plentiful, the plant forms a ground hugging rosette composed of 6–8 generally obovate leaves, each up to 95millimeters (3¾in) long. These leaves are carnivorous, having a large surface area densely covered with stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands with which they attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey, most commonly flies. [...] These so-called [...] "summer leaves" [...] are replaced by [...] "winter rosettes" [...] of small, glandless succulent leaves {{with the onset of}} the dry season in October. [...] This protective winter rosette allows the plant to undergo winter dormancy until the first rains begin in May. [...] Flowers born singly on upright 10–25centimeters (4–10in.) peduncles emerge twice during the year (from the summer rosette and again from the winter rosette), a feature rare among the Mexican species. In the summer these appear in June, peak in August and September, and disappear with the return to the winter rosette in October or November.|$|E

2500|$|Called graisse (or [...] "grease") by the French and les vins filant by Pasteur, this fault {{has been}} {{observed}} in apple wines and cider. It can also be potentially be caused by other spoilage microbes such as Streptococcus <b>mucilaginous,</b> Candida krusei, and Acetobacter rancens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{products}} of the plant are <b>mucilaginous,</b> resulting in the characteristic [...] "goo" [...] or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble fiber. Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. Okra {{may be used in}} developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity.|$|E
2500|$|A cocoa pod (fruit) has a rough, {{leathery}} rind about [...] thick (this {{varies with}} the origin and variety of pod) filled with sweet, <b>mucilaginous</b> pulp (called baba de cacao in South America) with a lemonade-like taste enclosing 30 to 50 large seeds that are fairly soft and a pale lavender to dark brownish purple color.|$|E
2500|$|The plant's {{leaves are}} 2–4nbsp&cm. (0.8-1.5 in.) long, highly {{filiform}} (elongated and narrow), round in cross-section and tapering at the end. Young leaves are bright green and grow uprightly; as they age, they darken to a maroon (color) and droop. The leaf surface {{is covered with}} stalked <b>mucilaginous</b> glands along its entire length. These serve not only to attract and trap insect prey, but also allow the plant to [...] "hold on" [...] to neighboring structures for support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaves of}} all species are round {{in cross section}} and highly elongated, {{tapering}} at the end. The surface of the leaves is densely studded with glandular hairs which secrete a <b>mucilaginous</b> substance from their tip. These serve to attract small insects, which upon touching the sticky secretions are ensnared. Unless they {{are strong enough to}} escape, the insect prey either die of exhaustion or asphyxiate as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Unlike the sundews, however, Byblis can move neither their tentacles nor the leaves themselves to aid trapping or digestion. As a result, they are grouped among the [...] "passive flypaper traps" [...] along with Pinguicula, Drosophyllum, Roridula, Stylidium and Triphyophyllum peltatum.|$|E
2500|$|Leaves and stems: Prostrate (even subterranean) {{trunks of}} soft brittle wood, with trunk to [...] in diameter; which branch {{repeatedly}} {{at or below}} ground level, forming a large prostrate clone. The branches each support a great cabbage-like, densely packed leaf-rosettes of 30–40 leaves; each branch cloaked with older, dead foliage. Branches produced near ground-level are [...] capable of [...] rooting that supports a [...] "creeping" [...] horizontal growth-form. [...] The leaves are oblong and narrow slightly where they attach to the rosette; they can be up to [...] long and [...] wide. [...] The leaves are capable of secreting limited quantities of a <b>mucilaginous</b> fluid containing [...] polysaccharides. [...] The upper leaf surface has a hair cushion which is also often coated with dried mucilage. [...] The lower surface is covered densely with a thick, white felty covering of lantate hairs. [...] Growth rates are very slow.|$|E
2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a <b>mucilaginous</b> adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|E

60|$|Having {{pretty well}} {{exhausted}} the botany of Churra, Dr. Thomson and I {{started on the}} 13th of September for {{the eastern part of}} the Khasia and Jyntea mountains. On the Kala-panee road,* [The Pea-violet (Crotalaria occulta) was very common by the road-side, and smelt deliciously of violets: the English name suggests the appearance of the flower, for which and for its fragrance it is well worth cultivation.] which we followed, we passed crowds of market people, laden with dried fish in a half-putrid state, which scented the air for many yards: they were chiefly carp, caught and dried at the foot of the hills. Large parties were bringing down baskets of bird-cherries, cinnamon-bark, iron, pine planks, fire-wood, and potatoes. Of these, the bird-cherries (like damsons) are made into an excellent preserve by the English residents, who also make capital cherry-brandy of them: the trade in cinnamon is of recent introduction, and is much encouraged by the Inglis family, to whose exertions these people are so greatly indebted; the cinnamon is the peeled bark of a small species of Cinnamomum allied to that of Ceylon, and though inferior in flavour and <b>mucilaginous</b> (like cassia), finds a ready market at Calcutta. It has been used to adulterate the Ceylon cinnamon; and an extensive fraud was attempted by some Europeans at Calcutta, who sent boxes of this, with a top layer of the genuine, to England.

60|$|If, {{however, the}} lobes {{are made to}} close over a bit of meat or an insect, the result is different, for the glands over the whole surface of the leaf now secrete copiously. [page 296] As {{in this case the}} glands on both sides are pressed against the meat or insect, the {{secretion}} from the first is twice as great as when a bit of meat is laid on the surface of one lobe; and as the two lobes come into almost close contact, the secretion, containing dissolved animal matter, spreads by capillary attraction, causing fresh glands on both sides to begin secreting in a continually widening circle. The secretion is almost colourless, slightly <b>mucilaginous,</b> and, judging by {{the manner in which it}} coloured litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. It is so copious that on one occasion, when a leaf was cut open, on which a small cube of albumen had been placed 45 hrs. before, drops rolled off the leaf. On another occasion, in which a leaf with an enclosed bit of roast meat spontaneously opened after eight days, there was so much secretion in the furrow over the midrib that it trickled down. A large crushed fly (Tipula) was placed on a leaf from which a small portion at the base of one lobe had previously been cut away, so that an opening was left; and through this, the secretion continued to run down the footstalk during nine days,--that is, for as long a time as it was observed. By forcing up one of the lobes, I was able to see some distance between them, and all the glands within sight were secreting freely.|$|E

If he be a prudent man (especially if he lives in Jamaica), he will have a plant of the pretty Overlook pea, {314d} trailing aloft somewhere, to prevent his garden being 'overlooked,' i.e. bewitched by an evil eye, in case the Obeah- bottle which hangs from the Mango-tree, charged with toad and spider, dirty water, and so forth, has no terrors for his secret enemy. He will have a Libidibi {314e} tree, too, for astringent medicine; and his hedge will be composed, if he be a man of taste-- as he often seems to be--of Hibiscus bushes, whose magnificent crimson flowers contrast with the bright yellow bunches of the common Cassia, and the scarlet flowers of the Jumby-bead bush, {314f} and blue and white and pink Convolvuluses.

Another pot-herb (to which I was afterwards more indebted than any) was a beautiful Smilacina, which grows from two to five feet high, and has plaited leaves and crowded panicles of white bell-shaped flowers, like those of its ally the lily of the valley, which it also resembles in its <b>mucilaginous</b> properties.

60|$|Previously to quitting the ship, Bob {{spoke of}} the poultry. There were but six hens, a cock, and five ducks, left. They were all as low in flesh and spirits, as it was usual to find birds that have been at sea fifty days, and the honest tar {{proposed}} turning them all adrift on the reef, {{to make their own}} living in the best way they could. Now and then a little food might be put in their way, but let them have a chance for their lives. Mark assented at once, and the coops were opened. Each fowl was carried to the taffrail, and tossed into the air, when it flew down upon the reef, a distance of a couple of hundred feet, almost as a matter of course. Glad enough were the poor things to be thus liberated. To Mark's surprise, no sooner did they reach the reef, than to work they went, and commenced picking up something with the greatest avidity, as if let loose in the best supplied poultry-yard. Confident there was nothing for even a hen to glean on the rocks when he left there, the young man could not account for this, until turning his eyes inboard, he saw the ducks doing the same thing on deck. Examining the food of these last-mentioned animals, he found there were a great number of minute <b>mucilaginous</b> particles on the deck, which no doubt had descended with the late rain, and which all the birds, as well as the hogs, seemed eager to devour. Here, then, was a supply, though a short-lived one, of a manna suited to those creatures, which might render them happy for a few hours, at least. Bob caught the ducks, and tossed them overboard, when they floundered about and enjoyed themselves in a way that communicated a certain pleasure even to the desolate and shipwrecked men who had set them at liberty. Nothing with life now remained in the ship but the goat, and Mark thought it best not to turn her ashore until they had greater facilities for getting the necessary food to her than the dingui afforded. As she was not likely to breed, there was no great use in keeping this animal at all, {{to say nothing of the}} means of feeding her, for any length of time; but Mark was unwilling to take her life, since Providence had brought them all to that place in company. Then he thought she might be a pretty object leaping about the cliffs of the crater, giving the island a more lively and inhabited appearance, though he foresaw she might prove very destructive to his plantations, did his vegetables grow. As there was time enough to decide on her final fate, it was finally settled she should be put ashore, and have a comfortable fortnight, even though condemned to die at the end of that brief period.|$|E
