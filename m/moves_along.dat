5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One piece is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece of art is a piece with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> the display that uses lenticular glass. Images represent themes {{of the river and}} of legal history.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly higher than that of Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> its orbit.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
50|$|In the {{geometric}} {{diagram of the}} apparatus, six bars of fixed length can be seen: OA, OC, AB, BC, CD, DA. The length of OA {{is equal to the}} length of OC, and the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal forming a rhombus. Also, point O is fixed. Then, if point B is constrained to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a circle (shown in red) which passes through O, then point D will necessarily have to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a straight line (shown in blue). On the other hand, if point B were constrained to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a line (not passing through O), then point D would necessarily have to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a circle (passing through O).|$|R

5|$|Once the Imps are working, {{the player}} must then {{set up a}} basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food, are bred), and a Treasury. After {{connecting}} the dungeon to a 'Portal', minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created in the workshop. Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, they can only be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to place them on the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{a system}} was {{developed}} that combined an adaptive {{surface with a}} glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber {{on the edges of}} the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light <b>moves</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal milling machine except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction.

25|$|This active {{butterfly}} {{is usually}} {{seen at the}} tops of trees and amidst foliage. It has a habit of landing and turning around almost immediately after alighting. It repeats this turning movements as it <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> branches. This is believed to help in evading predators by causing confusion about head orientation. This distinctive mode of movement gives the impression of dancing and is an important field characteristic that helps in identifying the species from even a distance.|$|E
25|$|Sublimation: If the air {{movement}} in the tunnel is sufficiently non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air <b>moves</b> <b>along,</b> but stay together as a sharp thin line. Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped {{in a manner that}} minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.|$|E

25|$|Escort: The attacking team is {{tasked with}} escorting a payload {{to a certain}} {{delivery}} point before time runs out, while the defending team must stop them. The payload vehicle <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> a fixed track when any player on the attacking team is close to it, but will stop if a defending player is nearby; should no attacker be near the vehicle, it will start to move backwards along the track. Passing specific checkpoints will extend the match time and prevent the payload from moving backwards from that point.|$|E
25|$|The angular {{velocity}} of a particle is measured around or {{relative to a}} point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ɸ and θ in radians), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity (v) of the particle has a component along the radius (radial component, v‖) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, v⊥). If there is no radial component, then the particle moves in a circle. On the other hand, {{if there is no}} cross-radial component, then the particle <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> a straight line from the origin.|$|E
