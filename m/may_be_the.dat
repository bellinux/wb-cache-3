5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E

5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{same size}} as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because {{there is a lack of}} star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{some enzymes}} display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} and {{acting on a}} range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Anlezark has {{tentatively}} {{suggested that}} Dunstan <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> medieval author of Solomon and Saturn citing the style, word choice, and Hiberno-Latin {{used in the}} texts.

5|$|In some situations, profit-maximizing {{prices are}} not an optimal strategy.

5|$|Irregular {{galaxies are}} chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all galaxies are irregular, and the {{peculiar}} shapes of such galaxies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of gravitational interaction.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{consequence of the}} Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|Some major oilfields such as Ghawar {{are found}} under {{the sands of}} Saudi Arabia. Geologists believe that other oil {{deposits}} were formed by aeolian processes in ancient deserts as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case {{with some of the}} major American oil fields.|$|E
