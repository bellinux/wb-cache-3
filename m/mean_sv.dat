50|$|SV is {{normally}} measured using an echocardiogram to record end diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV), and calculating the difference: SV = EDV - ESV. SV {{can also be}} measured using a specialized catheter, {{but this is an}} invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient. A <b>mean</b> <b>SV</b> for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance. Normal range for SV would be 55-100 mL. An average resting HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60-100 in some individuals. Using these numbers, (which refer to each ventricle, not both) the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0-8.0 L/min.|$|E

To {{elaborate}} {{curves of}} longitudinal reference intervals of pulsatility index (PI) and systolic velocity (SV) for uterine (UtA), umbilical (UA), and middle cerebral arteries (MCA), in low risk pregnancies. Methods. Doppler velocimetric measurements of PI and SV from 63 low risk pregnant women between 16 and 41 weeks of gestational age.

40|$|It is {{important}} to verify the old findings of Cumming (1972) and Goldberg and Shephard (1980) who showed that stroke volume (SV) may be higher during recovery rather than during exercise, in order to organize the number of intervals throughout training sessions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to re-evaluate individual SV responses to various upright cycling exercises using the nitrous-oxide rebreathing method. Nine moderate to well-trained male athletes volunteered to take part in the study (maximal O 2 uptake (VO 2 max) : 60. 2 ± 7 mL⋅min- 1 ⋅kg- 1). Workloads ranging from 40 - 100 % of VO 2 max were applied to determine individual peak SV (SVpeak) response. Results showed that SV responses were higher during exercise compared to recovery in all exercise loads from 40 - 100 % of VO 2 max. <b>Mean</b> <b>SV</b> responses to individual SVpeak loads were also higher during exercise compared to recovery (122. 9 ± 2. 5 versus 105. 3 ± 5. 93 mL). The highest SV responses to 10 min exercises of 40 - 70 % of VO 2 max were obtained in the 5 th or 7. 5 th min of each stage (p≤ 0. 05). Meanwhile, during 5 min exercises between 80 - 100 % of VO 2 max, peak SV responses were observed in the 3 rd min of loading (p≤ 0. 05). In conclusion, individual SVpeak levels encountered over wide exercise intensity ranges showed that SVpeak development may also be correlated to exercise intensity corresponding to individual SVpeak loads...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} Bayesian model of {{iterative}} learning on social networks that is computationally tractable; {{the agents of}} this model are fully rational, and their calculations can be performed with modest computational resources for large networks. Furthermore, learning is efficient, {{in the sense that}} the process results in an information-theoretically optimal belief. This result extends Condorcet’s Jury Theorem to general social networks, preserving rationality, computational feasibility and efficient learning. The model consists of a group of agents who belong to a social network, so that a pair of agents can observe each other’s actions only if they are neighbors. We assume that the network is connected and that the agents have full knowledge of the structure of the network, so that they know the members of the network and their social connections. The agents try to estimate some state of the world S (say, the price of oil a year from today). Each agent has a private measurement: an independently acquired piece of information regarding S. This is modeled, for agent v, by a number Sv picked from a Gaussian distribution with mean S and standard deviation one. Accordingly, agent v’s prior belief regarding S is a normal distribution with <b>mean</b> <b>Sv</b> and standard deviation one. The agents start acting iteratively. At each iteration, each agent takes the optimal action given its current belief. This action reveals its mean estimate of S to its neighbors. Then, observing its neighbors ’ actions, each agent updates its belief, using Bayes ’ Law. We show that this process is efficient: all the agents converge to the belief that they would have, had they access to all the private measurements. Additionally, and in contrast to other iterative Bayesian models on networks, it is computationally efficient, so that each agent’s calculation can be easily carried out...|$|E
40|$|The CeO₂ NPs are {{increasingly}} {{used in industry}} but the environmental release of these NPs and their subsequent behavior and biological effects are currently unclear. This study evaluates {{for the first time}} the effects of CeO₂ NPs on the survival and the swimming performance of two cladoceran species, Daphnia similis and Daphnia pulex after 1, 10 and 100 mg. L⁻¹ CeO₂ exposures for 48 h. Acute toxicity bioassays were performed to determine EC₅₀ of exposed daphnids. Video-recorded swimming behavior of both daphnids was used to measure swimming speeds after various exposures to aggregated CeO₂ NPs. The acute ecotoxicity showed that D. similis is 350 times more sensitive to CeO₂ NPs than D. pulex, showing 48 -h EC₅₀ of 0. 26 mg. L⁻¹ and 91. 79 mg. L⁻¹, respectively. Both species interacted with CeO₂ NPs (adsorption), but much more strongly in the case of D. similis. Swimming velocities (SV) were differently and significantly affected by CeO₂ NPs for both species. A 48 -h exposure to 1 mg. L⁻¹ induced a decrease of 30 % and 40 % of the SV in D. pulex and D. similis, respectively. However at higher concentrations, the SV of D. similis was more impacted (60 % off for 10 mg. L⁻¹ and 100 mg. L⁻¹) than the one of D. pulex. These interspecific toxic effects of CeO₂ NPs are explained by morphological variations such as the presence of reliefs on the cuticle and a longer distal spine in D. similis acting as traps for the CeO₂ aggregates. In addition, D. similis has a <b>mean</b> <b>SV</b> double that of D. pulex and thus initially collides with twice more NPs aggregates.

Thoracic impedance {{has been shown to}} be a noninvasive alternative to these methods for assessing these responses during graded exercise to exhaustion, yet its feasibility during supramaximal bouts of exercise is relatively unknown. We used thoracic impedance to estimate stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) during the Wingate test (WAnT) and compared these values to those from graded exercise testing (GXT). Active men (n = 9) and women (n = 7) (mean age = 24. 8 ± 5. 9 yr) completed two Wingate tests and two graded exercise tests on a cycle ergometer. During exercise, heart rate (HR), SV, and CO were continuously estimated using thoracic impedance. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to identify potential differences in hemodynamic responses across protocols. Results: Maximal SV (138. 6 ± 37. 4 mL vs. 135. 6 ± 26. 9 mL) and CO (24. 5 ± 6. 1 L·min- 1 vs. 23. 7 ± 5. 1 L·min- 1) were similar (p > 0. 05) between repeated Wingate tests.

40|$|Myriad {{biological}} {{factors have}} been proposed to explain premature ejaculation (PE). However, data correlating PE with seminal vesicles (SVs) are sparse. The study aimed to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} size of SV and PE. The cross-sectional study included 44 outpatients with PE and 44 volunteers without PE, and the size of SV was compared. Self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), the International Index of Erectile Function- 15, and the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index were used for assessment of symptoms. Compared to the control group, the PE group had significantly higher mean anterior-posterior diameter (APD) of SV (P < 0. 001). The optimal <b>mean</b> APD of <b>SV</b> cutoff level was 9. 25 mm for PE. In the PE group, PEDT was also higher with a <b>mean</b> APD of <b>SV</b> ≥ 9. 25 mm compared with <b>mean</b> APD of <b>SV</b> < 9. 25 mm. PEDT was significantly correlated with the <b>mean</b> APD of <b>SV</b> (r = 0. 326, P = 0. 031).

Hydraulic criteria meant to protect fish that encounter screens have been developed, but primarily for screens that are vertical to the water flow rather than horizontal. For this reason, we measured selected hydraulic variables and released wild rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss over two types of horizontal flat-plate fish screens in the field. Our goal {{was to assess the}} efficacy of these screens under a variety of conditions in the field and provide information {{that could be used to}} develop criteria for safe fish passage. We evaluated three different inverted-weir screens over a range of strewn (0. 24 - 1. 77 m(3) /s) and diversion flows (0. 10 - 0. 31 m(3) /s). Approach velocities (AVs) ranged from 3 to 8 cm/s and sweeping velocities (SVs) from 69 to 143 cm/s. We also evaluated a simple backwatered screen over stream flows of 0. 23 - 0. 79 m(3) /s and diversion flows of 0. 08 - 0. 32 m(3) /s.

40|$|In a {{clinical}} investigation, Kumar and coworkers reported the hemodynamic events that accompany plasma volume expansion over 3 hours in healthy adult volunteers, {{and found that}} increases in stroke volume (SV) {{may be related to}} increases in left ventricular (LV) /right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume, as they expected, but also to decreases in LV/RV end-systolic volume. The latter finding suggests increased contractility and/or decreased afterload, which do not fit with their perception that clinicians ascribe increases in SV to increases in end-diastolic volume based on Starling's work. Increased ejection fraction and decreased vascular resistances were also observed. The same authors recently reported novel data suggesting that reduced blood viscosity may account for the observed reduction in vascular resistances with saline volume expansion. However, the variances in preload and afterload, along with uncertainty in estimates of contractility, substantially limit their ability to define a primary mechanism to explain decreases in LV end-systolic volume. A focus on using ejection fraction to evaluate the integrated performance of the cardiovascular system is provided to broaden this analytic perspective. Sagawa and colleagues described an approach to estimate the relationship, under clinical conditions, between ventricular and arterial bed elastances (i. e. maximal ventricular systolic elastance [Emax] and maximal arterial systolic elastance [Ea]), reflecting ventricular–arterial coupling. I used the mean data provided in one of the reports from Kumar and coworkers to calculate that LV Emax decreased from 1. 09 to 0. 96 mmHg/ml with saline volume expansion, while Ea decreased from 1. 1 to 0. 97 mmHg/ml and the SV increased (i. e. the increase in <b>mean</b> <b>SV</b> was associated with a decrease in mean afterload while the mean contractility decreased). The results reported by Kumar and coworkers invite further studies in normal and critically ill patients during acute saline-induced plasma volume expansion and hemodilution. If reduced viscosity decreases afterload, then this raises the questions by what mechanism, and what is the balance of benefit and harm associated with reduced blood viscosity affecting oxygen delivery? Why the mean Emax might decrease must be evaluated with respect to benefit in reducing ventricular work or a negative inotropic effect of saline...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous valve {{implantation}} is {{an evolving}} new approach for the over 30 % of all symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who cannot undergo surgical treatment due to relevant comorbiditie. As the non-inferiority of TAVI compared with surgical treatment was recently shown percutaneous treatment of severe aortic stenosis will likely become a standard method. Therefore {{and due to}} increasing experience with this technique the number of implantations will rise {{and the need for}} non-invasive evaluation will become even more necessary than it is already today. While assessment of symptomatic patients after valve repair should always start with physical examination, differentiation of symptoms caused by prosthetic valve dysfunction and other conditions needs specific diagnostic tools. Echocardiography and Doppler assessment are the method of choice also in patients after TAVI and, therefore, normal Doppler values have to be established. The present study determines the normal range for Doppler hemodynamics and EOA of two types of percutaneously implanted bioprosthetic valves (i. e. Edwards SAPIEN and CoreValve) after successful TAVI. As mild paravalvular regurgitation is common, especially in patients with CoreValve prostheses, only patients with severe aortic (or mitral) regurgitation were excluded due to alteration of forward-flow hemodynamics. In our experience the classification of paravalvular regurgitation is even more challenging in percutaneous valves than in conventional surgically implanted prostheses since the regurgitation jet is often eccentric and crescent-shaped. Moreover, measurement of the vena contracta is frequently not feasible. One limitation of our study is the fact that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was not routinely performed after TAVI. This modality shows higher sensitivity in AR evaluation than transthoracic echocardiographic studies in patients with a poor acoustic window and may help to identify posterior paravalvular leaks. In patients with treated severe aortic stenosis, the rate of deceleration of the diastolic regurgitant jet and the derived pressure half-time are not helpful in evaluation of AR since they are more depending on the LV compliance and pressure then on the AR itself. As recommended we used an integrative approach with an emphasis on the flow profile in the thoracic and abdominal aorta since a holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta indicates an at least moderate AR. The strength of the presented data are the additionally considered hemodynamic parameters like LVEF and SV since their consideration is required for an adequate interpretation of Doppler data due to the flow dependence. In most of the published literature about normal values for Doppler gradients this crucial information is missing. However, a preserved LVEF does not rule out impaired systolic function and a paradoxical low flow situation resulting in low gradients. In consequence, the SV has a greater significance for the flow profile than LVEF alone. Importantly, our study population has normal mean flow hemodynamics with a <b>mean</b> <b>SV</b> of over 70 ml and a SVI of 40 ml/m 2. In case of treating patients with low flow hemodynamic situation, our normal values have to be used with caution but the EOA and the DVI should still be valid. In patients with aortic prostheses and narrow LV outflow due to LV hypertrophy, the velocity proximal to the prosthesis may be elevated and {{should be included in the}} Bernoulli equation to derive the pressure gradients more accurately. But there is still a good correlation between pressure gradients derived from the simplified Bernoulli equation and hemodynamically measured gradients. The present publication was neither designed as a comparison between the different available percutaneous aortic valves nor between other surgically implanted aortic prostheses. Rather, it describes the hemodynamic performances of the Edwards Sapien and the CoreValve transcatheter aortic valves in a large cohort of patients. We performed only non-invasive evaluation of the different valves and no corresponding invasively measured hemodynamic values were obtained. Yet, a good correlation between continuous wave Doppler data and catheter-based hemodynamics has been shown for prostheses in the aortic position and routinely follow-up examinations will be performed non-invasively for the majority of the patients. Although our four patient groups are not matched, there were no significant differences regarding LVEF, heart rate and SV between the different valves. CoreValve 26 mm prostheses were found to have significantly lower mean peak velocities as well as lower peak and average mean gradients. Furthermore, the CoreValve 29 mm prosthesis had, on average, a significantly greater EOA compared to the Edwards Sapien 23 mm. These findings are consistent with previous studies on aortic prostheses which reported an inverse correlation between valve size and flow velocities. Although the CoreValve 26 mm had the greatest orifice area indexed to the patient’s body surface area no significant difference could be found compared with the other valve types. To describe the function of prosthesis using the indexed EOA is more reasonable since it better reflects the combination of valve function and condition of each patient present. The EOA has to be proportionate to the patient’s body size to keep the hemodynamic parameters low. Hence, the indexed orifice area was shown to be the only parameter with impact on the clinical outcome. Taken together, no percutaneous valve can be considered superior regarding to hemodynamic function. Therefore, the decision, which valve to implant should be driven by the aortic annulus diameter and the optimal interventional access for each patient. In comparison to previously published hemodynamic data of mostly stented surgically implanted bioprosthetic aortic valves the percutaneous valves tend to have lower mean peak velocities and pressure gradients. Even the normal values of some stentless valves seem higher than the tested percutaneous valves. The EOA is similar compared with previously published data of surgically implanted stented bioprosthetic aortic valves. It is not possible to compare the indexed EOA since this parameter is generally not given in the available literature. Our results appear all the more surprising because the diseased and often severely calcific leaflets of the native valve are only crushed against the supporting valvular sinuses during the valvuloplasty and the following valve implantation and are not surgically resected. Accordingly, recoil could be expected leading to reduction of the orifice area and an increase of the transvalvular pressure gradients. The frequent paravalvular regurgitation could enhance the hemodynamic effects additionally. Since the vast majority of index echocardiographic examinations took place in the first month, no information is available about mid-term alterations. However, in a subgroup analysis, no significant differences regarding the EOA and the indexed EOA in patients examined more than one month after TAVI could be detected. Importantly, since our study did not include patients after conventional therapy our comparison with surgically implanted valves is only based on previously published data. In conclusion, Doppler echocardiography is the preferred non-invasive modality for the follow-up evaluation of prosthetic valve function. This study establishes normal Doppler values for Edwards Sapien and CoreValve transcatheter aortic valves but the comparison with the individual baseline values should be considered if feasible...|$|E

Assuming MRI estimates (x) as a reference, an excellent correlation was found with volume measured by utilizing the segmentation procedure (y) (y= 0. 89 x + 13. 78, r= 0. 98). The <b>mean</b> error on <b>SV</b> was 8 ml and the mean error on EF was 2 %.

The aetiology of the seizures includes opportunistic infections, neoplasia, HIV itself, metabolic derangements and drugs. Apart from treating {{the cause of the}} seizures, the challenge is to use the appropriate anticonvulsant drug (AED) to avoid potentially adverse drug–drug interactions in patients who are on concurrent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Initial recommendations were that the newer AEDs should preferably be used because of their simpler pharmacokinetics. We report on our experience with the use sodium valproate (SV) in eight patients who were on concurrent HAART. There were two males and six females {{with a mean age of}} 34. 1 years. The <b>mean</b> dose of <b>SV</b> was 1075 mg per day. Seizure control was excellent, the CD 4 count improved and there was successful viral suppression in all patients. This small study showed that SV was safe and effective. It is also relatively inexpensive compared to the newer AEDs – an important consideration in resource poor settings...|$|R

Inertial sensors are now small enough to integrate into footwear providing a potential platform for continuous monitoring that does not require additional components to be worn by the athlete. We investigate the suitability of using foot mounted inertial sensors to assess foot kinematics in steady state running by employing inertial navigation and pedestrian dead reckoning techniques. The results are evaluated by comparison with an optical motion capture system. Two techniques are assessed, {{the use of an}} Extended Kalman Filter with zero velocity updates and a linear de-drifting technique. Assessment of two example metrics, foot clearance (FC) and <b>mean</b> step velocity (<b>SV),</b> produced a bias and standard deviation of 0. 000 m± 0. 008 (FC) and 0. 04 m/s± 0. 03 (SV) using the linear de-drifting technique. Similar results were obtained using an Extended Kalman Filter approach calculating FC with a bias of 0. 002 m± 0. 029 and SV with a bias of 0. 03 m/s± 0. 02...|$|R

MethodsA 2 -year prospective observational study in 38 consecutive patients requiring continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and intracranial pressure monitoring with TCD. ResultsOf the 38 patients, 10 (26. 3 %) had NCSE by continuous EEG monitoring. Bilateral mean and maximal systolic and diastolic TCD velocities were significantly different between patients with and those without NCSE. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves of mean and maximal systolic velocities by TCD were 0. 82 (95 %CI, 0. 64 – 1. 00) and 0. 79 (95 %CI, 0. 62 – 0. 95) with cutoffs of 95 cm/s and 105 cm/s, respectively. Areas under the ROC curves of mean and maximal diastolic velocities were 0. 76 (95 %CI, 0. 56 – 0. 95) and 0. 78 (95 %CI, 0. 60 – 0. 96) with cutoffs of 31 cm/s and 40 cm/s, respectively. For none of the velocity parameters did the areas under the ROC curves differ significantly between the left and right sides. The best performance was obtained using <b>mean</b> systolic (<b>SV)</b> and a cutoff of 95 cm/s, which yielded a positive likelihood ratio of 3. 8 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 25. ConclusionOur preliminary results showed a significant association between increased TCD velocities and NCSE in comatose patients. However, the likelihood ratios suggested a limited role for TCD in helping to diagnose seizure activity. Further studies with larger samples of NCSE patients are warranted to determine the exact contribution of TCD for NCSE detection in comatose ICU patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{hypothesized}} that overnight fasting {{after a short}} dietary period, especially with carbohydrates, could allow performing breath-hold diving with no restraint for diaphragm excursion and blood shift and without any increase of metabolism, and in turn improve the diving response. Methods: During two separate sessions, 8 divers carried out two trials: (A) a 30 -m depth dive, three hours after a normal breakfast and (B) a dive to the same depth, but after following a diet and fasting overnight. Each test consisted of 3 apnea phases: descent, static and ascent whose durations were measured by a standard chronometer. An impedance cardiograph, housed in an underwater torch, provided data on trans-thoracic fluid index (TFI), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO). Mean blood pressure (MBP), arterial O- 2 saturation (SaO(2)), blood glucose (Glu) and blood lactate (BLa) were also collected. Results: In condition B, duration of the static phase of the dive was longer than A (37. 8 +/- 7. 4 vs. 27. 3 +/- 8. 4 s respectively, P < 0. 05). In static phases, <b>mean</b> Delta <b>SV</b> value (difference between basal and nadir values) during fasting was lower than breakfast one (- 2. 6 +/- 5. 1 vs. 5. 7 +/- 7. 6 ml, P < 0. 05). As a consequence, since mean. HR values were equally decreased in both metabolic conditions, mean. CO value during static after fasting was lower than the same phase after breakfast (- 0. 4 +/- 0. 5 vs. 0. 4 +/- 0. 5 L. min(- 1) respectively, P < 0. 05). At emersion, despite the greater duration of dives during fasting, SaO(2) was higher than A (92. 0 +/- 2. 7 vs. 89. 4 +/- 2. 9...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M and serum viscosity (SV) levels at which retinal changes associated with hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) as a result of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) occur. In addition, the effect of plasmapheresis on HVS-related retinopathy was tested. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients with WM received indirect ophthalmoscopy, laser Doppler retinal blood flow measurements, serum IgM, and SV determinations. A total of 9 patients with HVS were studied before and after plasmapheresis. RESULTS: <b>Mean</b> IgM and <b>SV</b> levels of patients with the earliest retinal changes were 5442 mg/dL and 3. 1 cp, respectively. Plasmapheresis improved retinopathy, decreased serum IgM (46. 5 +/- 18 %; P =. 0009), SV (44. 7 +/- 17. 3 %; P =. 002), retinal venous diameter (15. 3 +/- 5. 8 %; P =. 0001), and increased venous blood speed by + 55. 2 +/- 22. 5 % (P =. 0004). CONCLUSION: Examination of the retina is useful in identifying the symptomatic threshold of plasma viscosity levels in patients with HVS and can be used to gauge the effectiveness of plasmapheresis treatment...|$|R

In this study, the effect of low- to moderate doses of vasopressin, a potent splanchnic vasoconstrictor, on changes in portal and hepatic venous pressures and splanchnic and hepato-splanchnic blood flows were assessed in elective liver resection surgery. Methods: Twelve patients were studied. Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (<b>SV),</b> <b>mean</b> arterial (MAP), central venous (CVP), portal venous (PVP) and hepatic venous pressures (HVP) were measured, intraoperatively, at baseline and during vasopressin infusion at two infusion rates (2. 4 and 4. 8 U/h). From arterial and venous blood gases, the portal (splanchnic) and hepato-splanchnic blood flow changes were calculated, using Fick's equation. Results: CO, SV, MAP and CVP increased slightly, but significantly, while systemic vascular resistance and heart rate remained unchanged at the highest infusion rate of vasopressin.

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer {{arises from}} normal cells through the {{stepwise}} accumulation of genetic alterations. Cancer development {{can be studied}} by direct genetic manipulation within experimental models of tumorigenesis. Thereby, confusion by the genetic heterogeneity of patients can be circumvented. Moreover, identification of the critical changes that convert a pre-malignant cell into a metastatic, therapy resistant tumor cell, however, is one necessary step to develop effective and selective anti-cancer drugs. Thus, for {{the current study a}} cell culture model for malignant transformation was used: Primary human fibroblasts of the BJ strain were sequentially transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the genes for hTERT (cell line BJ-T), simian virus 40 early region (SV 40 ER, cell line BJ-TE) and H-Ras V 12 (cell line BJ-TER). Results The stepwise malignant transformation of human fibroblasts was analyzed on the protein level by differential proteome analysis. We observed 39 regulated protein spots and therein identified 67 different proteins. The strongest change of spot patterns was detected due to integration of SV 40 ER. Among the proteins being significantly regulated during the malignant transformation process well known proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as well as the chaperones mitochondrial heat shock protein 75 kDa (TRAP- 1) and heat shock protein HSP 90 were identified. Moreover, we find out, that TRAP- 1 is already up-regulated by <b>means</b> of <b>SV</b> 40 ER expression instead of H-Ras V 12. Furthermore Peroxiredoxin- 6 (PRDX 6), Annexin A 2 (p 36), Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI- 2) and Keratin type II cytoskeletal 7 (CK- 7) were identified to be regulated. For some protein candidates we confirmed our 2 D-PAGE results by Western Blot. Conclusion These findings give further hints for intriguing interactions between the p 16 -RB pathway, the mitochondrial chaperone network and the cytoskeleton. In summary, using a cell culture model for malignant transformation analyzed with 2 D-PAGE, proteome and cellular changes can be related to defined steps of tumorigenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Six anesthetized {{dogs were}} studied {{to analyze the}} {{relation}} between aortic pressure (P) and dimension (D) with and without Nifedipine (NF). An electromagnetic flowmeter was instrumented around the proximal ascending aorta (Ao) and one pair of ultrasonic dimension gauge around the proximal third of the discending Ao. A Millar's micro-transducer was placed just below the dimension gauge. A constrictor was placed around the thoracic Ao distal to the dimension gauge for acute constriction of Ao (Ao. OC). After control recording, Ao was constricted and AoP increased to 137. 7 % of the control level for 5 sec, and then Ao. OC was released abruptly. After complete recovery, NF (0. 75 γ/kg/min) was infused for 10 min, and the same procedure was repeated. %Distensibility (percent change (%△D) in AoD/pulse pressure) was obtained on each stage. After Ao. OC, %Distensibility was decreased significantly from 0. 267 ± 0. 077 to 0. 132 ± 0. 029 (p＜ 0. 02), suggesting that %Distensibility was dependent on the afterload. Beat-to-beat mean P (Y-axis) -mean D (X-axis) relation was obtained during the release from the Ao. OC. This mean P-D relation discribed a convex-upward curve and was fitted by an exponential function. The slope (S) of the mean P-lnD relation was 372 ± 102 before NF, while after NF the mean P-lnD line shifted {{to the left and}} S was significantly lowered (304 ± 129 :P＜ 0. 05). When mean AoP or stroke volume (SV) before and after NF was compared at the same level of mean D which was reduced to 5 % of the control <b>mean</b> D, <b>SV</b> was incresed to 130 %(P＜ 0. 02) and the mean AoP also tended to be increased (105 % : NS).

40|$|Many {{previous}} {{qualitative studies}} have shown that tumours are less vascular in the centre, and that host tissues become more vascular in close proximity to tumours. However, quantitative findings presented here for human colorectal cancer reveal some significant differences. Sections from 20 colorectal carcinomas (ten moderately and ten poorly differentiated) were immunostained with the QB/end/ 10 monoclonal to demonstrate blood vessels. These were measured by interactive morphometry and vascular volume density, surface density (Sv) and length density were recorded. In poorly differentiated carcinomas, the tumour centre was significantly less vascular than the periphery for all three parameters (P = 0. 008 for Sv). However, no significant difference was seen for moderately differentiated tumours, which constitute the majority of colorectal cancers. Surrounding host tissues did not show a general increase in vascular density close to tumours. Furthermore, when total viable tissue was considered, the vascular density of carcinomas was not markedly different from normal mucosa. In the centre of moderately differentiated carcinomas for example, the <b>mean</b> value for <b>Sv</b> was only 1. 4 times higher than the mean value for normal mucosa. These findings suggest that colorectal cancers may elicit a relatively weak angiogenic response, consistent with their exceptionally slow growth rate...|$|R

An observational {{study of the}} Kuroshio was conducted using data collected in the East China Sea (ECS) north of Okinawa from December 2002 through November 2004 {{with an array of}} inverted echo sounders and acoustic Doppler current profilers. Using these data, Kuroshio velocity structure and transport time series were obtained. Net absolute transport ranges between 4 and 29 Sv and has spectral peaks at periods of 60, 15 and 11 days. The mean net absolute transport is 18. 5 ± 0. 8 Sv. In conjunction with these in situ measurements, satellite altimeter data were used to extend the Kuroshio transport time series back to 1993. Comparison with net Ryukyu Current transport southeast of Okinawa shows that their <b>mean</b> sum (24 <b>Sv),</b> is less than the mean predicted Sverdrup transport. Additionally, Kuroshio and Ryukyu Current transports are positively correlated, with 60 day lag, due to the effect of mesoscale eddies impinging on the Kerama Gap. Finally, annually-averaged Kuroshio and Ryukyu Current transports correlate positively with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. The correlations, r, which are highest at zero lag, are 0. 76 for the Kuroshio and 0. 49 for the Ryukyu Current. The combined transport variation correlated with PDO index variation is about 4 Sv. PDO index is strongly negatively correlated with NCEP wind stress curl over the central North Pacific at 20 °- 30 °N. ...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{transmission}} {{depends on}} the continued availability of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs) for triggered release from presynaptic boutons. Surprisingly, small boutons in the brain, that already contain comparatively few SVs, are thought to retain {{the majority of these}} SVs in a “reserve” pool that is not mobilized under physiological conditions. Why such a scarce synaptic resource is normally inaccessible has been a matter of debate. Here, we readdress this issue by developing an electrophysiological approach for counting SVs released from boutons formed by a single, isolated neuron on itself (“autapses”). We show that, after treatment with Bafilomycin A 1 to prevent reloading of discharged SVs with glutamate, each SV is counted only once on first-time release. Hence, by integrating all autaptic currents as they run down over time, we can estimate the total number of SVs released by a single neuron. This total can be normalized to the number of boutons on the neuron, giving the <b>mean</b> number of <b>SVs</b> released per bouton. We estimate that up to ≈ 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over ≈ 10 min of stimulation at 0. 2 Hz. This number of vesicles represents a substantial proportion {{of the total number of}} SVs (100 – 200) that have been counted in these boutons by using electron microscopy. Thus, mild electrical stimulation, when maintained for sufficient time, causes the eventual release of many of the SVs in a bouton, including those in the putative reserve pool. This result suggests that SVs are functionally homogeneous in that the majority can contribute to basal synaptic transmission...|$|R
