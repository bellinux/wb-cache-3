40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{comparative}} economic analysis is {{conducted on the}} two kinds of acid gas treatment process, i. e. Claus sulfur recovery (CSR) and acid gas injection (AGI). The largest acid gas field in China, Puguang gas field, {{is used as a}} study case for the proposed methodology. The detailed cost of the sulfur recovery process by traditional Claus unit is compared with the one of acid gas re-injection process. On the basis of the designed process, investment scale of the two different options for acid gas process is thoroughly investigated from the following three aspects, i. e. fixed assets investment, annual operating costs including labor costs, <b>maintenance</b> costs, <b>accessories</b> consumption, etc., and energy costs including water-consuming, fuel gas, and electricity. The preliminary result shows that the investment of acid gas injection process is generally about 60 % of the Claus desulfurization process, and it may show a certain fluctuation with consideration of labor costs, energy prices, project scale and other factors in Puguang gas field in China...|$|R
40|$|Rhodococcus fascians is {{currently}} the only phytopathogen of which the virulence genes occur on a linear plasmid. To get insight into {{the origin of this}} replicon and into the virulence strategy of this broad-spectrum phytopathogen, the sequence of the linear plasmid of strain D 188, pFiD 188, was determined. Analysis of the 198, 917 bp revealed four syntenic regions with linear plasmids of R. erythropolis, R. jostii, and R. opacus, suggesting a common origin of these replicons. Mutational analysis of pFi- 086 and pFi- 102, similar to cutinases and type IV peptidases, respectively, showed that conserved region R 2 was involved in plasmid dispersal and pointed toward a novel function for actinobacterial cutinases in conjugation. Additionally, pFiD 188 had three regions that were unique for R. fascians. Functional analysis of the stk and nrp loci of regions U 2 and U 3, respectively, indicated that their role in symptom development was limited compared with that of the previously identified fas, att, and hyp virulence loci situated in region U 1. Thus, pFiD 188 is a typical rhodococcal linear plasmid with a composite structure that encodes core functions involved in plasmid <b>maintenance</b> and <b>accessory</b> functions, some possibly acquired through horizontal gene transfer, implicated in virulence and the interaction with the host. © 2012 The American Phytopathological Society.

40|$|The use of whole-genome phylogenetic {{analysis}} has revolutionized {{our understanding of}} the evolution and spread of many important bacterial pathogens due to the high resolution view it provides. However, the majority of such analyses do not consider the potential role of accessory genes when inferring evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, the recently discovered importance of the switching of gene regulatory elements suggests that an exhaustive analysis, combining information from core and accessory genes with regulatory elements could provide unparalleled detail of the evolution of a bacterial population. Here we demonstrate this principle by applying it to a worldwide multi-host sample of the important pathogenic E. coli lineage ST 131. Our approach reveals the existence of multiple circulating subtypes of the major drug-resistant clade of ST 131 and provides the first ever population level evidence of core genome substitutions in gene regulatory regions associated with the acquisition and <b>maintenance</b> of different <b>accessory</b> genome elements...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Spermatogenesis {{took place}} in noctule bats during summer; {{spermatozoa}} were released from the testis in August and September, and the testes then involuted. Although no more spermatozoa were produced, they continued to be stored in the cauda epididymidis {{for the duration of}} winter. The testosterone content of the testes rose with the progress of spermatogenesis from 10 ng/pair in May to 847 ng/pair in August. The concentration of the hormone in the blood plasma paralleled this increase, rising from 4 =. ng/ml to 134 ng/ml over the same period. Testosterone levels were maintained during autumn, when most mating took place, but decreased during the subsequent winter period of sperm storage. The weights of the accessory glands and their fructose content were maintained over this period. It appears that the <b>maintenance</b> of active <b>accessory</b> glands of repro-duction and of fertile spermatozoa in the epididymis has a compara-tively low androgen requirement in noctule bats...|$|R
40|$|When {{consumers}} {{are in need}} of help concerning how to use electrical equipment they immediately take a quick look at household product manuals. Generally, household consumer product manuals contain a contents section and there are other sections such as safety rules, technical features, the use of the product, the use of the <b>accessories,</b> <b>maintenance</b> and cleaning. Product manuals are desig-ned for a specific reader with the aim of giving the needed information. Thus, they can be thought as representing a register of their own. In order to understand these registers there are three contextu-al parameters which are field, tenor and mode variables. Field of discourse refers to the subject and focus of interaction. Tenor of discourse marks the relationship between the interactants. Mode of discourse refers to spoken or written interaction. These three contextual parameters are represented through three meanings; ideational, interpersonal and textual. Concerning the linguistic analysis of the study, Halliday’s systemic functional grammar is applied to operational manuals. The linguis-tic analysis concerns 3 meanings: ideational, interpersonal and textual. In terms of ideational mea-ning the linguistic categories used in the analysis can be listed as follows: a) Second Person Prono...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that fitness-related traits such as male mating frequency, with a history of strong {{directional}} selection, should have little additive genetic variance and thus respond asymmetrically to bidirectional artificial selection. However, recent findings and theory suggest that a balance between selection for increased male mating frequency and opposing selection pressures on physiologically linked traits will cause male mating frequency to have high additive genetic variation and hence respond symmetrically to selection. We tested these hypotheses in the stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni, in which males hold harems comprising many females and so have the opportunity to mate at extremely high frequencies. We subjected male stalk-eyed flies to artificial selection for increased (‘high’) and decreased (‘low’) mating frequency in the presence of ecologically realistic, high numbers of females. High line males mated significantly more often than control or low line males. The direct response to selection was approximately symmetric in the high and low lines, revealing high additive genetic variation for, and no significant genetic constraints on, increased male mating frequency in C. dalmanni. In order to investigate trade-offs that might constrain male mating frequency under natural conditions we examined correlated responses to artificial selection. We measured accessory gland length, testis length and eyespan after 7 and 14 generations of selection. High line males had significantly larger accessory glands than low line males. No consistent correlated responses to selection were found in testis length or eyespan. Our results suggest that costs associated with the production and <b>maintenance</b> of large <b>accessory</b> glands, although yet to be identified, are likely to be a major constraint on mating frequency in natural populations of C. dalmanni...|$|R
