Goods such as cotton, <b>molasses,</b> <b>sugar,</b> tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe.

60|$|This article {{provided}} for a direct {{trade between the}} United States and the British West India Islands, in American vessels not exceeding seventy tons burden, conveying the produce of the States or of the Islands; but it prohibited the exportation of <b>molasses,</b> <b>sugar,</b> coffee, cocoa, or cotton, in American vessels, either from the United States or the Islands, to {{any part of the}} world. Under this article it was a restricted intercourse, but Mr. Jay considered the admission even of small vessels, to the trade of these islands, an important advantage to the commerce of the United States. He had not sufficiently adverted to the fact that, among the prohibited articles, cotton was also a product of the Southern States. Its cultivation had been but recently introduced there; so that when he sailed for Europe hardly sufficient had been raised for domestic consumption, and at the time of signing the treaty very little, if any, had been exported. Still it was now becoming an important staple of the South, and hence the objection of the Senate to this article of the treaty. On the 24th of June two-thirds of the Senate, the constitutional majority, voted for the ratification of the treaty, stipulating, however, that an article be added suspending so much of the twelfth article as respected the West India trade, and that the President be requested to open, without delay, further negotiation on this head.|$|E

50|$|To make <b>molasses,</b> <b>sugar</b> cane is {{harvested}} {{and stripped}} of leaves. Its juice is extracted, usually by cutting, crushing, or mashing.

First syrup is usually referred to in the Southern states of the U.S. as cane syrup, as opposed to molasses. Second molasses is created from a second boiling and sugar extraction, and has a slightly bitter taste.|$|E
