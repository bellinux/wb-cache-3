50|$|Fossil Bay {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular anchorages, {{particularly}} for small boats that prefer to tie up to one of two docks rather than anchor or pick up a <b>mooring</b> <b>ring.</b> Fossil Bay is an inlet that opens to the southeast.|$|E
50|$|Few {{remnants}} of the iron works that remain; a large flat area sits where the business stood. As late as the 1970s, an old ship's <b>mooring</b> <b>ring</b> {{was seen in the}} area. Remnants of slag from the furnaces can still be found in the area. In 1970, the property was acquired by the Department of Forest & Parks Maryland and is now part of the Gunpowder State Park.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays {{it offers}} around 1160 <b>mooring</b> <b>rings,</b> a wedge launch and a {{bunkering}} station. However, several {{services such as}} electricity and water supplies are available for the users.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} year, a {{dozen more}} landings were carried out. <b>Mooring</b> <b>rings</b> and securing bars were implanted, which acted as a solid base that could subsequently {{be used as a}} landing platform for building materials. This foundation was built out of 37 cubic metres of stone work.|$|R
50|$|New Romney is a {{small town}} in Kent, England, on the edge of Romney Marsh, an area of flat, rich {{agricultural}} land reclaimed from the sea after the harbour began to silt up. New Romney, one of the original Cinque Ports, was once a sea port, with the harbour adjacent to the church, but is now more than a mile from the sea. A <b>mooring</b> <b>ring</b> can still be seen in front of the church. It is the headquarters of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
50|$|The day {{starts with}} breakfast and a safety brief from the skipper. Then they {{each have a}} turn at occupying {{different}} tasks on the boat, like pulling in the painters off the <b>mooring</b> <b>ring</b> and starting the engine. They then sail from West Cowes Marina to Yarmouth where they moor the boat at the marina. The young people then go and visit the lifeboat that is stationed in Yarmouth marina. They then have fish and chips on the green next to the marina and spend time socialising and team-building. They then turn {{in for the night}} on board the yachts.|$|E
50|$|The Library Garden {{is located}} {{on top of the}} former site of Christian IVs old Naval Harbour. The harbour was flanked by an arsenal - now housing the Tøjhus Museum - and a supply depot, both {{completed}} in 1694, and was connected to the main harbour by a narrow canal. Later the Navy was moved to Holmens Kanal and the old harbour was filled in 1867. The garden was designed in 1920 by landscape gardener Jens Peder Andersen and Christiansborg's architect Thorvald Jørgensen. As a reminder of its maritime past, a small pond has been retained {{in the middle of the}} gardens and an old <b>mooring</b> <b>ring</b> of the type used by ships in the 17th and 18th centuries has been built into the masonry at the end of the gardens.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{with more}} than a {{thousand}} <b>mooring</b> <b>rings,</b> Le Havre marina has underestimated its success.In order to deal with the increasing demand, Le Havre is planning to open a new marina: Port Vauban. Using the old dock present in the city centre, 500 moorings rings will be created at the beginning of 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} ærkriu {{found on}} both the Kingmoor and Bramham <b>Moor</b> <b>Rings</b> is interpreted as a spell for staunching blood, based on comparison with a charm containing the sequence ærcrio found in Bald's Leechbook (i.vii, fol. 20v). For this reason, the entire inscription is likely a protective or healing charm or spell with the ring serving as an amulet.|$|R
25|$|The esplanade is bounded to {{the north}} and to the south by the Grand port and the Petit port respectively, thus constituting the Aix port which is the largest fresh water port in the country with 1,500 <b>mooring</b> <b>rings,</b> having privileged places for boating on the lake, with boats having a summer or annual allocation. The festival of {{yachting}} takes place each year. This event has old boats coming from all horizons, a professional market, demonstrations and shows.|$|R
5000|$|The {{memorial}} {{is constructed}} in sandstone and polished granite, with plaques in marble. It is about 2.4 m high and about 2.6 m long. The memorial {{is in the}} form of a tomb chest on a tall plinth standing on an ashlar base. The base is decorated with rope-work, and on each corner is a bollard with an iron <b>mooring</b> <b>ring.</b> The plinth is in sandstone, and the tomb chest is in granite. There are pilasters on the corners, and each side contains a sunken marble plaque. Above is a cornice, and on the top of the memorial is a carving that represents a broken mast protruding at an angle through waves. Two of the panels contain inscriptions, and the panel on the west side has a relief carving. This carving depicts a view from above of a sinking lifeboat and its crew surrounded by waves. The inscriptions include the following: :IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF:FOURTEEN OF THE HEROIC CREW OF THE SOUTHPORT LIFEBOAT:"ELIZA FEARNLEY":WHO TOGETHER WITH THE CREW OF THE ST ANNE'S LIFEBOAT PERISHED ON:A GALLANT EFFORT TO RESCUE THE CREW OF THE GERMAN BARQUE [...] "MEXICO":WRECKED ON THIS COAST ON THE NIGHT OF THE 9TH DECEMBER 1886:GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAT THIS THAT A MAN LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS ...|$|E
5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. <b>Mooring</b> <b>rings</b> were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|R
50|$|Swanbridge and the {{waterfront}} protected by Sully Island {{had been used}} as a commercial harbour and port for several hundred years, although {{there is no sign of}} this today. Cargo arrived and departed via the St Mary’s Well Bay Road, which is now blocked off to through traffic, en route for the traditional market at Canton Cross in Cardiff. As late as the early 1970s the harbour’s iron <b>mooring</b> <b>rings</b> could still be seen at the eastern end of the bay.|$|R
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and <b>mooring</b> <b>rings,</b> would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|R
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of <b>mooring</b> <b>rings</b> and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is of Ancaster stone from Lincolnshire, and {{is said to}} have been paid for with coal from the Wollaton pits owned by Willoughby; the labourers were also paid this way. Cassandra Willoughby, Duchess of Chandos recorded in 1702 that the master masons, and some of the statuary, were brought from Italy. The decorative gondola <b>mooring</b> <b>rings</b> carved in stone on the exterior walls offer some evidence of this, as do other architectural features. There are also obvious French and Dutch influences. The exterior and hall have extensive and busy carved decoration, featuring strapwork and a profusion of decorative forms. The window tracery of the upper floors in the central block and the general business of the decoration look back to the Middle Ages, and have been described as [...] "fantasy-Gothic".|$|R
5000|$|However, {{contributing}} to the belief of a port at Helston was the discovery of what some people believe to be slipways and <b>mooring</b> <b>rings,</b> during excavations around 1980. There was no known shipping from the sea after 1260, but before 1200, in the 1182 record of Godric of Helleston paying a fine of ten marks for exporting his corn out of England from Helston without a licence. This {{could be considered the}} most significant piece of documentary evidence signifying Helstons former port days, though it does not prove the case.; [...] At the time of Domesday Book, Gweek had no inhabitants whilst Helston was the largest settlement in the west of Cornwall, with 113 households. In 1837 a plan was drawn up to open Loe Pool to shipping using a pier to counteract siltation, but it was never carried out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You jest, {{my little}} friend," [...] said Tressilian; [...] "here {{is nothing but}} a bare <b>moor,</b> and that <b>ring</b> of stones, with a great one in the midst, like a Cornish barrow." ...|$|R
50|$|Relations with Nicola {{came to a}} head when, frightened for his father's safety when Nicola {{took him}} up to the <b>moors,</b> Miles <b>rang</b> the police to arrest her. But Donald had finally given up on his young wife and Miles was {{relieved}} when he kicked her out. He was wary when he gained a new work-colleague in Carl King, but found amusement in Carl and Matthew's feud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Foster," [...] {{continued}} the <b>Moor,</b> drawing the <b>ring</b> in question from his vest-pocket, [...] "take this. Show {{it to the}} captain of the guard at the Bagnio, who will admit you. Tell him that I sent you for one of the slaves. After that your own intelligence must guide you. Go, and God go with you." ...|$|R
25|$|The acid {{soils and}} peat bogs are {{unsuitable}} for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles {{and the common}} shrew are absent on the moors. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders {{that live in the}} heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the <b>moors</b> and <b>ring</b> ouzels live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.|$|R
40|$|Historical sources {{testify to}} the flourishing {{maritime}} activity at the ancient town of Tindari, mentioning a harbour but not supplying information on its location, size or configuration. Because a town as important as Tindari {{must have had a}} landing place for ships, we examined new sources of information with the aim to localize traces of the harbour. Holocene uplifted and submerged notches, identified along the Tindari promontory, and the <b>mooring</b> iron <b>rings,</b> testify to past sea level changes. These elements are used to reconstruct the palaeotopography of Tindari Cape and the Oliveri coastal plain in the 4 th century BC. The reconstruction reveals a safe landing place southeast of the Tindari Cape suitably protected from prevailing winds...|$|R
5000|$|Sandstones erode {{slowly and}} form poor acid soils which are {{deficient}} in nutrients. They are less permeable to water, impeding drainage and encouraging {{the formation of}} bogs. Sphagnum moss bogs are common where there is abundant rain and poor drainage. Cotton grass is a distinctive plant which grows in the boggy areas. In the cold acid waters of peat bogs there is little decomposition of organic material {{with the result that}} the dead sphagnum moss gradually accumulates to form peat. This raises the levels of the bogs and they dry out. Heather then invades the area. Large areas of the moors are now covered in heather, bilberries and grasses growing on thick layers of peat.The acid soils and peat bogs are unsuitable for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles and the common shrew are absent on the moors. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders that live in the heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams.

The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.About 20 per cent of the national park is covered in bracken. Few things can grow under its dense cover and it does not support many insects and is unpalatable to most animals. The bracken is extremely invasive.|$|R
2500|$|This {{is one of}} {{the nationally}} {{important}} Rombalds <b>Moor</b> cup and <b>ring</b> rocks. They were engraved in the neolithic era, and the larger engraved rocks have been left on the moor as it is thought that their meaning may be associated with the landscape. [...] This more portable rock is in the museum for safety: the plough-marks on the rock indicate {{one of the reasons for}} this. The Heygate stone {{is one of the}} clearest examples of this type of petroglyph. [...] A cast of the engraving reveals that the two larger ring-marks are superimposed on the others. The stone was found in Near Hey Gate Field near Baildon by a local landowner on 25 September 2001, and it is believed that it was originally a rock with a larger area of 5000-year-old petroglyphs that had been quarried nearby in recent history, then dressed on two sides for wall-building. [...] It is at the landowner's wish that the stone is preserved at the museum, as near as possible to its original site, because it cannot now be returned to the position where it lay in the neolithic era.|$|R
5000|$|The small square opening {{leads into}} {{a much larger}} chamber within the cliffs. The {{entrance}} is about 5 ft square, and runs in for about 12 ft. The cave was a natural opening in the limestone which was enlarged so that its greatest depth and greatest breadth are 27 ft, and its height at one point is 15 ft. There is speculation about its origin and about what {{it has been used}} for in the past. Suggestions include its use by the Shirenewton Quakers for storing tea, or for the storing of explosives by Brunel when the railway was built. A local antiquarian, J.G. Wood, wrote in 1901 that nearly 50 years earlier he had quizzed the oldest inhabitants and discovered that this natural cave had been enlarged and fitted with a crane at its mouth to unload large ships that could moor there in deep water, but could not easily dock at the shallower wharves on the Chepstow side of the river. The cargo was then reloaded onto trows and taken up river to Monmouth and Hereford. For many years <b>mooring</b> chains and <b>rings</b> in the cliff below survived to support this explanation. [...] The cave can only be reached by boat at high tide.|$|R
