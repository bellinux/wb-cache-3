5|$|For the game's characters, the {{developers}} {{intended to keep}} the comical looks from the previous games, but they decided to update their appearances with realistic materials and textures {{to take advantage of}} the more powerful level of graphics capabilities of seventh-generation consoles. The designers first drew character sketches to determine the characters' looks and clothing, creating a main and an alternate outfit for each character, which were then made into reference artwork. Afterward, low-level meshes for each character were created, with details added with Zbrush, resulting in characters that, before being scaled down for the game environment, had more than six million polygons. Textures and pixel shaders were added using the team's previous work on Tony Hawk's Project 8 to match the style of earlier Guitar Hero games. Unlike the Tony Hawk games, each character in the game was given a unique skeleton to match their variations in sizes and shapes, allowing the animators to create unique moves for individual characters. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. Slash, Tom Morello, and Bret Michaels, each performing one or more songs from their past recordings. All three were brought into the game using motion capture from the <b>Motion</b> <b>Analysis</b> Corporation.|$|E

The ICC also carried out further video based three-dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, a strikingly similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of a normal, seemingly legal delivery was 8-10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Although the {{neurological}} impairments of Parkin-son’s disease (PD) {{patients are}} well known {{to go along with}} motor control deficits, e. g., tremor, rigidity, and reduced move-ment, not much is known about the motor control parameters affected by the disease. In this paper, we therefore present a novel approach to human <b>motions</b> <b>analysis</b> using motor control strategies with joint weight parameterization. We record the motions of healthy subjects and PD patients performing a hand coordination task with the whole-body XSens MVN motion capture system. For our <b>motion</b> strategy <b>analysis</b> we then follow a two step approach. First, we perform a complexity reduction by mapping the recorded human motions to a simplified kinematic model of the upper body. Second, we reproduce the recorded motions using a Jacobian weighted damped least squares controller with adaptive joint weights. We developed a method to iteratively learn the joint weights of the controller with the mapped human joint trajectories as reference input. Finally, we use the learned joint weights for a quantitative comparison between the motion control strategies of healthy subjects and PD patients. Other than expected from clinical experience, we found that the joint weights are almost evenly distributed along the arm in the PD group. In contrast to that, the proximal joint weights of the healthy subjects are notably larger than the distal ones. I...|$|R
