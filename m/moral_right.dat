5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this <b>moral</b> <b>right,</b> {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the status of}} authors' <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> in a post-Dastar world. It argues that, apart from the minimal recognition of <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> for visual artists in the Visual Artists Rights Act (1990) {{and a handful of}} state laws, Creative Commons and other open access movements currently represent the only effective recognition of <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> in the United States. This paper examines approaches to <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> in a variety of open-access scenarios, including Creative Commons, free software, Wikipedia, and Google Books, and it attempts to assess the advantages and dangers of offering <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> as an alternative to regular copyright protection. The paper argues that open access models do not provide sufficient protection for <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> in the United States. Rather, the approach to <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> in open access movements should be used as a starting-point for the broader recognition of <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> under U. S. law.

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{accession}} of the Soviet Union to the UCC in 1973, some Soviet works were copyrighted {{in some other}} countries. One well-known case concerned {{the actions of the}} four Soviet composers Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and Myaskovsky against the movie company 20th Century Fox. 20th Century Fox had published a movie called The Iron Curtain, using music of these four composers as background music and crediting the composers. The four Soviet composers initiated legal actions against the movie company, claiming that the use of their names and music in a movie whose theme was objectionable to them and that was unsympathetic to the Soviet ideology libeled them and violated their civil rights. In the U.S., the courts dismissed these claims in Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox (80 N.Y.S.2d 575 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1948), affirmed, 87 N.Y.S.2d 430 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949)), in particular because the works of these composers were in the public domain in the U.S. at that time because there were no international treaties relating to copyright between the U.S. and the USSR. The compositions themselves also had not been distorted, so the court found that the composers' <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> to the integrity of the work was not violated.|$|E

40|$|The “moral right” is {{an aspect}} of a {{copyright}} law that seeks to protect the non-commercial, personal, or spiritual interests of an author in his work. This paper argues that <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> can make {{an important contribution to}} culture in developing countries. In particular, <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> provide a counterweight to the increasingly commercial orientation of the international copyright system under the TRIPS Agreement, which may ultimately prove to be damaging to development and culture.

500|$|In February 2009, Cameroonian {{musician}} Manu Dibango filed {{a lawsuit}} claiming that [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] and [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin used the [...] "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" [...] hook without his permission.

Agence France-Presse reported that Jackson admitted that he borrowed the line for [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin and settled out of court. When Rihanna asked Jackson in 2007 for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. Dibango's attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding €500,000 in damages and asking for Sony BMG, EMI and Warner Music to be [...] "barred from receiving 'mama-say mama-sa'-related income until the matter is resolved". The judge ruled that Dibango's claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango's name in the liner notes of future French releases of [...] "Don't Stop the Music", {{and at the time}} of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> to seek further damages.|$|E
500|$|Raskolnikov exemplifies all the {{potentially}} disastrous hazards contained {{in such an}} ideal. Frank notes that [...] "the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity {{on the one hand}} and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd". Raskolnikov's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and [...] "useless" [...] old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoyevsky wants to show that this utilitarian type of reasoning and its conclusions had become widespread and commonplace; they were by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov's tormented and disordered mind. Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov's character and, likewise, contempt for the lower qualities in Man and for His ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher social good, believes that he possesses a <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> to kill. Indeed, his [...] "Napoleon-like" [...] plan drags him to a well-calculated murder, the ultimate conclusion of his self-deception with utilitarianism.* Sergeyef (1998), 26 ...|$|E
500|$|Still, a {{wide range}} of {{viewpoints}} exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the [...] "subjects of a life" [...] with moral value and therefore moral rights. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a [...] "moral dilemma" [...] view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the new Australian <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> legislation. It looks at how the <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> regime may (or may not) assist Indigenous creators, and considers why <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> have been perceived as holding an integral place in providing adequate legal protection for Indigenous art in Australia. The article first outlines the history of <b>moral</b> <b>rights,</b> tracing their origins in French law, before examining Australian debates {{leading up to the}} enactment of <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> as an amendment to the Copyright Act in late 2000. The two new <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> - the right of integrity and the right of attribution - are discussed. The article argues that the new <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> have limited value for Indigenous creators because they are individual rather than communal rights, and consequently false attribution or identity claims are not actionable. To make up for the deficiencies of the <b>moral</b> <b>rights</b> regime, the article concludes by proposing the development of sui generis legislation that accommodates Indigenous intellectual property laws and the concept of communal ownership and custodianship of art, stories and other knowledge concerning the management of the land.

2500|$|The {{philosophical}} {{arguments in}} the abortion debate are deontological or rights-based. [...] The view that all or almost all abortion should be illegal generally rests on the claims: (1) that the existence and <b>moral</b> <b>right</b> to life of human beings (human organisms) begins at or near conception-fertilization; (2) that induced abortion is the deliberate and unjust killing of the embryo in violation of its right to life; and (3) that the law should prohibit unjust violations {{of the right to}} life. [...] The view that abortion should in most or all circumstances be legal generally rests on the claims: (1) that women have a right to control what happens in and to their own bodies; (2) that abortion is a just exercise of this right; and (3) that the law should not criminalize just exercises of the right to control one's own body and its life-support functions.|$|E
