Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained. Healthy volunteers (n = 25) and patients (n = 34) with cirrhosis underwent whole-liver T 1 rho MR imaging at 1. 5 <b>T.</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 rho values were calculated from liver regions of interest. <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 r values were correlated to clinical data and histopathologic analysis by analysis of variance.

Results: <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 rho values of volunteers (mean, 40. 9 msec +/- 2. 9 [standard deviation]; range, 33. 9 - 46. 3 msec) were significantly lower than those of patients who were Child-Pugh class A (P <. 004), B (P <. 001), or C (P <. 001), and {{significant differences were found between}} each ChildPugh stage (A vs B, P <. 002; B vs C, P <. 009; A vs C, P <. 001). Liver cirrhosis was confirmed via histologic analysis in all patients with liver biopsy. <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 rho values did not correlate with necroinflammatory activity (r = 0. 31; P =. 23), degree of steatosis (r = 0. 016; P =. 68), or presence of iron load (r = 0. 22; P =. 43). <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 r values performed well by assessing the Child-Pugh stage, with receiver operating characteristic areas of 0. 95 - 0. 98.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} Gd-DTPA on cartilage T 2 mapping using turbo-mixed (tMIX) imaging, and to show the possible usefulness of the tMIX technique for simultaneously acquiring T 1 and T 2 information in cartilage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty volunteers underwent MRI of the knee using the tMIX sequence before and after gadolinium administration. T 1 and T 2 maps were calculated. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 was determined on the pre- and postcontrast T 1 maps. T 2 relaxation values before and after gadolinium administration were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The obtained relaxation values are in correspondence with previously published data. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 before gadolinium administration was 449 msec +/- 34. 2 msec (SD), and after gadolinium administration it was 357 msec +/- 55. 8 msec (SD). The postcontrast T 1 relaxation range was 221. 5 - 572. 8 msec. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 of the precontrast T 2 maps was 34. 2 msec +/- 3. 1 msec (SD), and the <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 of the postcontrast T 2 maps was 32. 5 msec +/- 3. 1 msec (SD). These are statistically significant different values. A correction for the postcontrast T 2 values, using a back-calculation algorithm, yielded a 98 % correlation with the precontrast T 2 values. CONCLUSION: The absolute difference of pre- and postcontrast T 2 is very small and is ruled out using the back-calculation algorithm. Combined T 1 -T 2 tMIX cartilage mapping is a valuable alternative for separate T 1 and T 2 cartilage mapping. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveAnkle {{fracture}} {{patients were}} used as a model to study the long-term effect of the removal of joint loading on knee cartilage quality in human subjects. DesignThe knees of 10 patients with ipsilateral ankle fractures were investigated using delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) {{at the time of}} ankle injury. After 6 weeks' prescribed unloading of the affected leg, but no restrictions regarding knee movement, the cast was removed from the ankle and the patient underwent a second dGEMRIC examination. Physiotherapy was then initiated. A third dGEMRIC examination was performed 4 months after remobilization, and a final examination 1 year after the injury. ResultsBaseline T 1 Gd values for the 10 patients were within a narrow range. No significant change in <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 Gd was observed after 6 weeks' prescribed unloading, but the T 1 Gd range had increased significantly. Four months after remobilization, the <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 Gd was significantly lower than in the previous examinations, and the range remained significantly broader than at baseline. At the 1 -year follow-up, the <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 Gd was almost identical to the value after remobilization, and the T 1 Gd range still showed a significant increase compared to the baseline investigation. ConclusionsRemoval of knee cartilage loading for 6 weeks resulted in a measurable effect on the cartilage matrix, as evidenced by a broader T 1 Gd range. A decrease in <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 Gd was observed 4 months after remobilization. These differences persisted a year after injury compared to baseline...|$|R

Also, T 4 to T 3 conversion rates and T 3 disposal rates were compared by noncompartmental analysis. While the <b>mean</b> total serum <b>T</b> 4 values were similar {{for the two}} groups, 8. 6 and 8. 1 mug/kl, the <b>mean</b> free <b>T</b> 4 value was significantly higher in the cirrhotic patients (3. 3 ng/dl) than in the normal subjects (2. 1 ng/dl, P less than 0. 001). The <b>mean</b> serum <b>T</b> 3 value, 85 ng/dl, was significantly reduced in the hepatic patients as compared to a <b>mean</b> serum <b>T</b> 3 value of 126 ng/dl in the normal subjects (P less than 0. 001), while the free T 3 value was 0. 28 ng/dl in both groups. The reduction of the serum total and free T 3 values were closely correlated with the degree of liver damage, as indicated by elevation of serum bilirubin (r equal - 0. 547) and reduction of serum albumin (r equal 0. 471). The mean serum TSH level was 3. 1 muU/ml in the normals and 7. 1 muU/ml in the cirrhotic aptients (less than 0. 001). 15 % of the hepatic patients had serum TSH values above 10 muU/ml, which, however, did not correlate {{with any of the}} four liver function tests studied. Serial blood sampling from two convalescing patients with alcoholic hepatitis showed a gradual normalization of serum TSH and T 3 levels as the liver function improved. After oral T 4 administration, 0. 25 mg/day for 10 days, three of four cirrhotic patients studied failed to raise their serum T 3 values. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 4 to T 3 conversion rate of seven normal subjects was 35. 7 %. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 4 to T 3 conversion rate of four cirrhotic patients studied was significantly reduced to 15. 6 % (P less than 0. 001). The mean disposal rates of T 4 and T 3 of the normal subjects were 114 and 34 mug/day, respectively. The ratio of T 4 disposal to T 3 disposal was 3. 5.
