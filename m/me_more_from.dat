SPKI/SDSI {{is a public}} key infrastructure whose creation was motivated by the perception that X. 509 is too complex and flawed. This thesis addresses {{the problem of how}} users that are part of a Public Key Infrastructure in a distributed computing system can effectively specify, create, and disseminate their Attribute Release Policies for Shibboleth using SPKI/SDSI. This thesis explores existing privacy mechanims, as well as distributed trust management and policy based systems. My work describes the prototype for a Trust Management Framework called SPADE (SPKI/SDSI for Attribute Release Policies in a Distributed Environment) that I have designed, developed and implemented. The principal result of this research has been the demonstration that SPKI/SDSI is a viable approach for trust management and privacy policy specification, especially for minimalistic policies in a distributed environment. ii Acknowledgements My parents, Mum and Dad, I dedicate this thesis to you.

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} part of {{learning a new language}} is to pay great attention to pronunciation. Tell <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is language learning software by Auralog which offers the students a diverse set of pronunciation activities with high levels of interaction and fully engaging the student in the learning process. Tell <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> enables the teacher to have more quality time in the classroom. The objective of this research is to identify whether Tell <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is better than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English. This experimental research was carried out to University students of English Department. The population was the second semester students. Two classes taken in this research were the experimental class and the control class. The independent variables are the use of teaching media and the attributive factor is students’ self-confidence while the dependent variable is pronunciation skill. Results: (1) Tell <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is more effective than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English; (2) students having high self-confidence have better pronunciation skill than students having low self-confidence; and (3) there is an interaction between the media used and students’ self-confidence in teaching pronunciation. Tell <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is more effective than Rosetta Stone in teaching pronunciation for students having high and low self-confidence.
