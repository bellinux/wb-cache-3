40|$|SummaryBackground:Few data exist {{with respect}} to the {{occurrence}} of chronic side effects due to antiepileptic drugs (AED) in routine clinical practice. Objective:To evaluate the prevalence of subjective complaints which patients with epilepsy regard as side effects of their AED treatment in a community-based population. Methods:Cross-sectional study. Subjects were identified through the database of AED-use in the pharmacies in a suburban area in The Netherlands. Respondents completed a brief questionnaire about their epilepsy, including a checklist with 30 complaints, which are common in AED users. Results:We present data of 346 responding adults with treated epilepsy from a population of 107, 000 adult inhabitants. Eighty percent was using monotherapy, with few patients taking new AEDs. Almost 60 % of the patients reported complaints probably due to side effects in at least three domains. General CNS-related side effects were reported most often; memory problems (21. 4 % of the patients) and fatigue (20. 3 %) were dominant. Polytherapy was associated with more side effects than monotherapy. We identified differences in profiles of complaints between valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin monotherapy. Complaints were not substantially associated with ongoing seizures or other treatment factors. Conclusions:The majority of patients taking AEDs for epilepsy think they have side effects form their drugs, even when seizures were in remission and when monotherapy was used. Our findings suggest a need to improve <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> of side effects of AEDs and to explore the feasibility of interventions aimed at reduction of such complaints in everyday clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare nonreferred, {{emergency}} department (ED) -admitted mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (MTBI) patients with and without self-reported cognitive complaints on (1) demographic variables and injury characteristics; (2) neuropsychological test performance; (3) 12 -day self-monitoring of perceived cognitive problems; and (4) emotional distress, physical functioning, and personality. METHODS: (Neuro) psychological assessment was carried out 6 months post-injury in 79 patients out of a cohort of 618 consecutive MTBI patients aged 18 - 60, who attended the ED of our level I trauma centre. Cognitive complaints were assessed with the Rivermead Postconcussional Symptoms Questionnaire (RPSQ). In addition, patients monitored concentration problems and forgetfulness during 12 consecutive days. RESULTS: Self-reported cognitive complaints were reported by 39 % of the patients. These complaints were strongly related to lower educational levels, emotional distress, personality, and poorer physical functioning (especially fatigue) but not to injury characteristics. Severity of self-reported cognitive complaints was neither associated with the patients' daily observations of cognitive problems nor with outcome {{on a range of}} neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSION: Self-reported cognitive complaints were more strongly related to premorbid traits and physical and emotional state factors than to actual cognitive impairments. In line with previous work, this suggests that treatment of emotional distress and fatigue may also reduce cognitive complaints. Cognitive outcome assessment of symptomatic MTBI patients should not be restricted to checklist ratings only, but also include a (neuro) psychological screening. In addition, daily <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> is a useful method to gather information about the frequency and pattern of cognitive problems in daily life...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} of patient rights in health sectors around the world. Patients’ right to complain in hospitals, often visible in legislative and regulatory protocols, {{can be an}} important information source for service quality improvement and achievement of better health outcomes. However, empirical evidence on complaint processes is scarce, particularly in the developing countries. To contribute in addressing this gap, we investigated patients’ complaint handling processes and the main influences on their implementation in public hospitals in Vietnam. Methods: The study was conducted in two provinces of Vietnam. We focused specifically on the implementation of the Law on Complaints and Denunciations and the Ministry of Health regulation on resolving complaints in the health sector. The data were collected using document review and in-depth interviews with key respondents. Framework approach was used for data analysis, guided by a conceptual framework and aided by qualitative data analysis software. Results: Five steps <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling were implemented, which varied in practice between the provinces. Four groups of factors influenced the procedures: (1) insufficient investment in complaint handling procedures; (2) limited <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> processes; (3) patients’ low awareness of, and perceived lack of power to change, complaint procedures and (4) autonomization pressures on local health facilities. While the existence <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling processes is evident in the health system in Vietnam, their utilization was often limited. Different factors which constrained the implementation and use <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> regulations included health system–related issues as well as social and cultural influences. Conclusion: The study aimed to contribute to improved understanding <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling processes and the key factors influencing these processes in public hospitals in Vietnam. Specific policy implications for improving these processes were proposed, which include improving accountability of service providers and better utilization <b>of</b> information on <b>complaints...</b>|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate SCF of breast cancer (BC) patients and to find predictors of impaired SCF. Both satisfaction and frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF were measured. Methods BC patients who were about to receive chemotherapy (N[*]=[*] 74) and patients with a benign breast disease (BBD) (N[*]=[*] 63) participated. Before chemotherapy started (Time 1) and 3 [*]months after ending chemotherapy (and at comparable moments for the BBD group) (Time 2), women completed validated questionnaires concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> and satisfaction with SCF, fatigue, perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results No differences were found between the BBD and BC patients concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF across time. Satisfaction with SCF decreased across time in BC patients but remained stable across time in BBD patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 001; p[*]=[*] 0. 003 after controlling for state anxiety and perceived stress). Correlation coefficients between the satisfaction and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF ranged between − 0. 26 and − 0. 49. Depressive symptoms and satisfaction with SCF (Time 1) predicted the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF (Time 2).
