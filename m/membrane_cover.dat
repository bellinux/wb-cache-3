50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Christoph Martens in 1995 and {{initially}} operated as engineering consultants. The {{early years of the}} company’s activities focused on the development of special biogas components. In 1997, Martens invented the so-called air-supported <b>membrane</b> <b>cover</b> for biogas plants. This technology is now used by various manufacturers of biogas plants. With the foundation of MT-Energie GmbH & Co. KG in 2001, the company increasingly focused on the construction of turnkey biogas plants. By the end of 2013, about 600 biogas projects with a total installed power of 350 MW had been completed. In 2007 the company opened its first site abroad in Italy. Today MT-Energie operates throughout Europe and distributes its products and services in many countries worldwide.MT-Energie was founded in the German town of Rockstedt in the district of Rotenburg (Wümme). In November 2008 the company moved its premises to the small town of Zeven in Lower Saxony. There, on the premises of 62,300 m2, the new headquarters including offices, logistics area and manufacturing buildings for gas processing plants were constructed.|$|E

40|$|A LTHOUGH various {{investigators}} have •* • * • indicated that gizzard lesions {{have been found}} as early as 18 days of embry-onic development, no studies {{on the time of}} appearance of these lesions {{have been reported in the}} literature. The establish-ment of the actual time of development and the determination, if possible, of those factors conditioning the time of origin seems desirable. Lillie (1927) has reported that the simple, tubular glands of the gizzard begin to form about the thirteenth or fourteenth day, and the lining of the gizzard is simply the hardened secretion of these glands. According to Calhoun (1933) this horny layer is about three-fourths as thick as the glandular layer adjacent to it.

40|$|Conventional'' waste {{landfills}} emit methane, {{a potent}} greenhouse gas, in quantities such that landfill methane {{is a major}} factor in global climate change. Controlled landfilling is a novel approach to manage landfills for rapid completion of total gas generation, maximizing gas capture and minimizing emissions of methane to the atmosphere. With controlled landfilling, methane generation is accelerated and brought to much earlier completion by improving conditions for biological processes (principally moisture levels) in the landfill. Gas recovery efficiency approaches 100 % through use of surface <b>membrane</b> <b>cover</b> over porous gas recovery layers operated at slight vacuum. A field demonstration project's results at the Yolo County Central Landfill near Davis, California are, to date, highly encouraging. Two major controlled landfilling benefits would be the reduction of landfill methane emissions to minuscule levels, and the recovery of greater amounts of landfill methane energy in much shorter times than with conventional landfill practice. With the large amount of US landfill methane generated, and greenhouse potency of methane, better landfill methane control can play a substantial role in reduction of US greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E

However, most analytical solutions only approximately represent this profile because of the assumption of uniform radial displacement field around the tunnel during its deformation which presumably exists only at shallow depths. For large diameter tunnels and when non-uniform grout pressure is used, tunnel axis is prone to distortion making these solutions unreliable. This paper examines experimental results of tunnel collapse in small-scale centrifuge environment. Tunnel walls were represented by pressurised rubber <b>membrane.</b> <b>Cover</b> to diameter ratio of the tunnel and relative density of the sand were the only variables in the tests.

40|$|Within {{this thesis}} we {{discussed}} the process of manufacture and installation of a steel membrane structure. We presented {{the main components of}} the facility and its advantages compared with conventional engineering structures. Although in Slovenia a number of such facilities have been placed, prejudices regarding membrane structures still occur. Above all, doubts about the load-bearing capacity and the durability of membrane covers occur, which is completely superfluous when choosing a high-quality manufacturer. The intended use of such structures is increasing day by day, which can be attributed to a quality implementation and a constant development of structures and membrane covers. Through the presented and described phases, also the machinery and other equipment that is necessary for a successful implementation and installation, is listed. A great advantage of steel membrane structures is represented by a simple foundation, which can be used at relatively large spans of the structure. A <b>membrane</b> <b>cover</b> with appropriately selected colours provides a good illumination of the place, while a good colour combination makes the facility visually attractive.

The article contains {{an analysis of the}} folding pattern {{under the weight of the}} cover, depending on the number and location of internal supports. The authors have analyzed the two alternative layouts of supports. In the first case, the option of one (central) support is considered; in the second case, the cover is based on vertical load-bearing structures located in four points at equal distances from the ends of the block. Numerical calculations performed by Lyra 9. 4 software have identified that the biggest deflection of the membrane occurs in its central part. We can conclude that the most intensive folding originates from the edges of support struts. A qualitative assessment of the results of numerical calculations was performed using the testing model of the <b>membrane</b> <b>cover.</b> Conclusions about the distribution of initial strains over the structure and assessment of their influence on the stress-strain state of the membrane unit were made.

40|$|A {{spectral}} method of Chebyshev collocation with domain decomposition is introduced for linear interaction between sound and structure in a duct lined with flexible walls backed by cavities {{with or without}} a porous material. The spectral convergence is validated by a one-dimensional problem with a closed-form analytical solution, and is then extended to the two-dimensional configuration and compared favorably against a previous method based on the Fourier-Galerkin procedure and a finite element modeling. The nonlocal, exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition is embedded in the domain decomposition scheme without imposing extra computational burden. The scheme is applied to the problem of high-frequency sound absorption by duct lining, which is normally ineffective when the wavelength is comparable with or shorter than the duct height. When a tensioned membrane covers the lining, however, it scatters the incident plane wave into higher-order modes, which then penetrate the duct lining more easily and get dissipated. For the frequency range of f= 0. 3 - 3 studied here, f= 0. 5 being the first cut-on frequency of the central duct, the <b>membrane</b> <b>cover</b> is found to offer an additional 0. 9 dB attenuation per unit axial distance equal to half of the duct height. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Anterior chamber depth, aqueous leakage, bubble maintenance time, and cornea morphology were monitored after each operation. The mean diameter of corneal perforation was 1. 60 ± 0. 55 [*]mm (range 0. 5 – 3) and the success rate of the AMR method for corneal perforation reconstruction was 100 % after a single operation.

40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} {{conceptual}} structural solution to support the Churchill Abattoirs waste water pond cover. The wastewater treatment pond is anaerobic and the waste it collects is from an abattoir source. Churchill Abattoirs engaged in a study of covering their ponds with a thin flexible membrane to control odour and to allow for the future capture of produced methane for electricity generation. This study identified a suitable <b>membrane</b> <b>cover</b> but also concluded that an effective support for the cover would be required to realise the full potential of the cover. This project aims to: 1. Research existing commercially available frames/structures to support a large waste water treatment pond cover. 2. Critically evaluate existing designs including material use. 3. Analyse existing pond cover application and use. 4. Establish performance criteria for the structure. 5. Develop improvements/innovations to available proven designs and resolve whether suggested developments are applicable to the Churchill Abattoir situation. 6. Develop a conceptual structural design for the cover support at Churchill Abattoir waste water treatment pond. The research methodology will consist of a literature review of available pond cover concepts and a critique of existing pond covers structures as well as any potential improvements. Finally conceptual designs will be developed and evaluated against a developed set of performance criteria. The performance criteria will be developed from knowledge established during the literature review as well as documented suggestions from Churchill Abattoirs that were discovered during their field trials of the cover membrane...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{landfilling}} is {{an approach}} to manage solid waste landfills, so as to rapidly complete methane generation, while maximizing gas capture and minimizing the usual emissions of methane to the atmosphere. With controlled landfilling, methane generation is accelerated to more rapid and earlier completion to full potential by improving conditions (principally moisture, but also temperature) to optimize biological processes occurring within the landfill. Gas is contained through use of surface <b>membrane</b> <b>cover.</b> Gas is captured via porous layers, under the cover, operated at slight vacuum. A field demonstration project has been ongoing under NETL sponsorship {{for the past several}} years near Davis, CA. Results have been extremely encouraging. Two major benefits of the technology are reduction of landfill methane emissions to minuscule levels, and the recovery of greater amounts of landfill methane energy in much shorter times, more predictably, than with conventional landfill practice. With the large amount of US landfill methane generated, and greenhouse potency of methane, better landfill methane control can play a substantial role both in reduction of US greenhouse gas emissions and in US renewable energy. The work described in this report, to demonstrate and advance this technology, has used two demonstration-scale cells of size (8000 metric tons [tonnes]), sufficient to replicate many heat and compaction characteristics of larger ''full-scale'' landfills. An enhanced demonstration cell has received moisture supplementation to field capacity. This is the maximum moisture waste can hold while still limiting liquid drainage rate to minimal and safely manageable levels. The enhanced landfill module was compared to a parallel control landfill module receiving no moisture additions. Gas recovery has continued for a period of over 4 years. It is quite encouraging that the enhanced cell methane recovery has been close to 10 -fold that experienced with conventional landfills. This is the highest methane recovery rate per unit waste, and thus progress toward stabilization, documented anywhere for such a large waste mass. This high recovery rate is attributed to moisture, and elevated temperature attained inexpensively during startup. Economic analyses performed under Phase I of this NETL contract indicate ''greenhouse cost effectiveness'' to be excellent. Other benefits include substantial waste volume loss (over 30 %) which translates to extended landfill life. Other environmental benefits include rapidly improved quality and stabilization (lowered pollutant levels) in liquid leachate which drains from the waste...|$|E
