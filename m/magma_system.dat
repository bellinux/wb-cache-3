40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of monogenetic vents and the geochemistry of their erupted products {{can be used to}} probe heterogeneity in lithospheric strain across a rift. We show that Quaternary volcanic belts in the central Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) exhibit differences in vent fractal clustering with an exponent indicative of more clustering and a shallower magma reservoir for the Wonji Fault Belt (WFB), in comparison to the Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone (SDFZ). The range of lengths that exhibit vent fractal clustering is bounded by (1) a lower cutoff of few hundreds of meters that correlates with the depth of emplacement of intrusive material and is likely linked to evolving silicic <b>magma</b> <b>systems</b> and (2) an upper cutoff which we interpret to scale with the depth from which dikes originate just prior to eruption: ~ 10 km for WFB and ~ 7 km for SDFZ. We attribute this difference to strain partitioning within the MER, which favors dike formation at greater depths beneath the more highly strained eastern margin of the MER (below the WFB), in comparison to the western rift margin (below the SDFZ). Statistical analysis of monogenetic fields in the MER show, when reviewed in light of a priori geophysical and geodetic data, that the plumbing system of monogenetic volcanism style is strongly controlled by crustal strain state.

ISV technology would permit experiments to test hypotheses or provide new data that cannot be tested or obtained through bench-top experimentation or the study of natural systems. The scale of ISV melts is intermediate between that of natural lava lakes and laboratory crucible experiments, with melt volumes from 15 to 300 m{sup 3 } easily obtained. This approach permits investigation of dynamic processes which operate on scales difficult to simulate through bench-top experimentation and that are not amenable to direct observation or control in natural systems (e. g., degassing, convection, and crystal settling).
