Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> earlier writing {{appointment}} {{that she was}} expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

[...] He was complimentary towards the conclusion of the Jim-Pam plot, noting that the final scene was [...] "a warm moment", although he was surprised by the scene's placement in the season as a whole. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote positively of the finale scene, noting that [...] "it really worked", and that Krasinski and Fischer were [...] "terrific" [...] during the sequence. However, he said that the [...] "comedy parts of 'Paper Airplane' were so dire I'm not going to dwell on them at all".|$|E

Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> <b>An</b> Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{he handed}} his {{information}} to the Slovak Jewish Council in April 1944, Vrba said Krasniansky had assured him that the report {{was in the right}} hands. Vrba and Wetzler spent the next six weeks in Liptovský Mikuláš, and continued to make and distribute copies of their report whenever they could. The Slovak Judenrat gave Vrba papers in the name of Rudolf Vrba, showing that he was a [...] "pure Aryan" [...] going back three generations, and supported him financially to the tune of 200 Slovak crowns a week, equivalent to an average worker's salary, and as Vrba wrote, [...] "sufficient to sustain <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> illegal life in Bratislava." [...] On 29 August 1944 the Slovak Army rose up against the Nazis and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia was announced. Vrba joined the Czechoslovak partisan units in September 1944, and was later awarded the Czechoslovak Medal of Bravery.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

500|$|Barrowman {{worked with}} Stonewall, a gay rights {{organisation}} in the UK, on the [...] "Education for All" [...] campaign against homophobia in the schools. In April 2008, the group placed posters on 600 billboards that read, [...] "Some people are gay. Get over it!" [...] Barrowman contributed his {{support to the}} project asking people to join him and [...] "Help exterminate homophobia. Be bold. Be brave. Be a buddy, not a bully." [...] That same month, Barrowman spoke at the Oxford Union about his career, the entertainment industry, and gay rights issues. The event was filmed for the BBC programme The Making of <b>Me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> episode exploring the science of homosexuality. He was voted Entertainer of the Year in 2006 by Stonewall (UK) and placed on the Out 100 list for 2008, an annual list of notable LGBT people compiled by Out magazine. In June 2010, Barrowman met with the then Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, {{as a representative of}} the LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

He {{was one of the}} five {{children}} of Donald and Patricia Bissell; his siblings included his twin brother William, two sisters Susan and Barbara, and brother Donald. The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high diving board, even though {{he did not know how}} to swim. He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, he tried to keep his lessons a secret, but word got out and he was ridiculed and bullied every single day for the rest of his school days. [...] "I was a skinny kid. They could have crushed <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> instant," [...] he stated.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences. According to Rolling Stone and MTV, other artists attributed as influences are The Ronettes, Dionne Warwick, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tina Turner ...|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{also claims}} that an {{external}} environment {{is necessary for}} the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. [...] "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intuition because I call them all together my representations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home. [...] I just decided to stop making work.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Lobositz, {{fought on}} 1 October 1756, {{was the first}} major battle of the Seven Years' War; the {{artillery}} played a significant role. [...] The guns started firing at about 6:00am, but it was occasional [...] fire: after 7:00am, the artillery put forth a sustained and effective effort. Although the Austrians held the higher ground as far as the infantry and cavalry were concerned, and the artillery thundered for the heights above the Prussian line so long and so loudly that even seasoned veterans became unnerved: some of the Croats in Maximilian Ulysses Reichsgraf von Browne's army fled {{to the rear of the}} field and even Browne himself, a life-long veteran, admitted to never hearing anything like it. [...] From 1:00pm onward, the Prussian howitzers pounded against the Austrian force so effectively the artillery used its ammunition at a rapid rate. The battle was not an unqualified success, although the Austrians abandoned the field which, in the 18th century, was tantamount to admitting defeat. Moller was promoted to lieutenant colonel the day after the battle, 2 October 1756, and received the Order Pour le Mérite. Frederick wrote to Field Marshal Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin: [...] "Moller has done miracles and secunded <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> astonishing manner." ...|$|E

[...] Asked how the collaboration came about, Azalea added, [...] "She said she would like to work with <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview and they reached out. We recorded a few different things and then one of those just ended up being, I think, undeniably great. Hopefully I think everybody will get to hear it at the beginning of next year." [...] In February 2015, Azalea tweeted there were [...] "epic" [...] ongoing plans for the song. For Spears's Billboard magazine cover story, published online on March 12, 2015, it was reported that despite Spears being back in the recording studio as back as in September 2014 working on a duet with Azalea, among other tracks, a proper full-length album would not be coming soon. Spears further explained, [...] "I'm gonna do [...] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try to do my best to do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now". Azalea confirmed the title of the track the following week. Afterwards, in Spears's cover story with People magazine, it was announced that [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] would be released on May 5.|$|E
