Such assessments get more importance when the site of interest is located near an active earthquake zone. Such situation is present for the location of Abu Zenima city. The city is characterized by the presence of industrial and <b>Maritime</b> <b>platform</b> in addition to other Oil production facilities. These industrial facilities motivated the present work. The simulated earthquake ground motion time histories are conducted using stochastic technique. The magnitude used for simulation is obtained using both probabilistic and deterministic approaches. An analysis using both approaches shows that moderate earthquakes {{in the vicinity of the}} site could have the largest effects on the area. Thus an earthquake of magnitude 4. 5 at a distance of 21 km is chosen as design earthquake.

40|$|In {{the coming}} decade, the Royal Netherlands Navy is {{planning}} to replace a number of <b>maritime</b> <b>platform</b> types. The starting points for these replacements have changed importantly, compared {{to those of the}} current and past generations. The focus is on manning reduction with three main reasons. First, the endangerment of defense personnel’s life should be minimized. Second, technical personnel are increasingly harder to find, especially for the maritime sector, which endangers the operational maintainability of future vessels. Third, the life cycle costs should decrease by lowering the personnel cost component. Accordingly, the Navy is defini ng future platforms and setting goals to reduce the crew size by a revolutionary 30 to 50 %. This paper describes the application of an integrated methods suite that supports the development of cost-effective and efficient future platforms with significantly less technical personnel. One of the conclusion is that such integration of methods leads to better defined methodological concepts that are easier to share, which is essential for multidisciplinary research and multi-party innovatio...|$|E

It presents how previous findings of individual, isolated aspects in human-computer-interaction can be transferred or adapted successfully to an application oriented environment that combines a variety of tools to interact with 3 D data. A special focus is put onto scale issues arising from the physical size and configuration of the immersive workspace: As opposed to indirect editing tools, the direct “hands-on ” manipulation paradigm that {{is used in the}} AutoEval system requires rescaling of 3 D objects that exceed the size of the physical interaction space, such as large architectural models or <b>maritime</b> <b>platform</b> designs. Such scaling operations, however, interfere with certain goals of the design review process, such as examining regulation conformance of exit routes in ship designs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Remote sensing {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to calculate suspended sediment concentrations and to understand the flux and distribution of sediments driven by mechanisms such as tides and waves, river discharges, etc. The main objective of this study is the quantification of the Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration in the sea breaking zone for a particular area of the Portuguese coast, around Aveiro. The methodology used was based on in situ measurements and multi spectral satellite images. In situ experimental techniques (<b>maritime</b> <b>platform,</b> aerial platform, simulation on the beach and water sample collection in the breaking zone) were used to determine a relationship between the TSM concentration and the seawater reflectance in the breaking zone. Spectral reflectance was measured with a spectroradiometer and water samples were simultaneously collected. Empirical relationships were established between TSM concentration and the equivalent reflectance values for sensors SPOT/HRVIR, TERRA/ASTER and Landsat/TM at visible and Near Infra Red (NIR) bands computed from the experimental data. Satellite images from ASTER, SPOT HRVIR and Landsat TM were used together with the same empirical models. These satellite images were calibrated and atmospherically corrected. Equations of linear, polynomial, logarithmic, power and exponential models were tested for the satellite image bands on the visible and near infrared. The coefficients of determination (R 2) were also calculated for each model. The results obtained from the two approaches, in situ measurements and directly from the multi spectral satellite images, were analysed. ...|$|E

40|$|Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a {{computational}} {{technique for}} the numerical simulation of the equations of fluid dynamics {{without the use}} of an underlying numerical mesh. Although originally developed for use in astrophysical gas dynamics, SPH has recently been applied to many other areas of numerical fluid dynamics and materials modelling, several of which have particular relevance to defence problems of interest to the DSTO. In this report we review the basics of the method and then describe a simple two-dimensional SPH code for the simulation of incompressible fluid flow. The code is then applied to simple problems such as a dam break, the sloshing of water and wave breaking over ships. These examples illustrate both the capabilities of the technique and the relative ease with which the method can treat problems which have previously been considered difficult to solve using traditional methods such as finite difference, finite volume or finite element grid based methods. Further applications of the method are then reviewed, concentrating in particular on the utility of the technique in solid mechanics modelling, and then current applications of SPH within <b>Maritime</b> <b>Platforms</b> Division are described...|$|R

40|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly complex to maintain and operate, due to rising demands in terms of operational capabilities, functional robustness and cost efficiency. Moreover, with an ongoing demand for reduced manning {{the need for more}} capable and clever control systems is obvious. Conventional automation approaches typically fall short on maintainability, robustness and scalability, and becoming inadequate to capture the complexity of modern maritime environments, with their abundance of data and dynamic nature. To resolve some of these concerns, the Command & Control group of TNO-FEL is researching the application of self-organizing systems theory for various types of maritime decision support systems. These biologically inspired systems are typically distributed, fast and reactive, computationally very simple, and above all, possess autonomous self-organizing properties that we can employ to build new platform control systems. The most typical example of self-organization are the so-called 'ant-based algorithms', which are a class of algorithms that mimic cooperative behavior of real ant behavior to achieve complex computations. The structural simplicity of these systems, together with their self-organizing capabilities make them a very interesting approach for certain types of computational challenges. We will demonstrate their use in damage control systems, platform management systems and decision support systems, and will describe how we envision their use infuture control systems...|$|R
40|$|Maritime surface {{surveillance}} is {{the process}} of obtaining and maintaining information about surface ships in a certain sea area. It is carried out by <b>maritime</b> <b>platforms</b> such as frigates, helicopters or maritime patrol aircraft. Surface surveillance plays a vital role in maritime operations like trade embargo operations, counterdrug operations and traditional warfare operations. The problem of finding optimal tactics for a single surveillance unit is a routing problem which can to some extent be considered {{as an extension of the}} on-line travelling salesman problem, but there are essential complications which call for a different approach. A mathematical formulation of the surveillance routing problem is given in this paper. The complications of this problem, in comparison to the on-line travelling salesman problem, are explained. This routing problem is part of the rather complicated process of maritime surface surveillance. SURPASS, an acronym of SURface Picture ASSessment, is a computer model which simulates this process. The model SURPASS provides insight into both the means (i. e. platforms and sensors) needed for a surveillance operation and the effectiveness of various existing and newly developed rules for surveillance tactics. The structure of SURPASS is explained, including the way in which it solves the surveillance routing problem. A number of decision rules that can be used in the routing of the surveillance units are described. The effectiveness of these rules is analysed and evaluate...|$|R

40|$|PR (Passive Radar) systems using digital {{broadcasting}} {{services such as}} DVB-T (Digital Versatile Broadcasting - Terrestrial) transmission as illuminators represent surveillance solutions which have rapidly evolved and matured over recent years. PR systems typically use coherent integration time {{in the order of}} a few hundred milliseconds to acquire enough dynamic for the detection of moving objects. This is done under the assumption that both the illuminator of opportunity and the receiver stay static during this time period. However, advances in miniaturization of high performing computers and data storage devices allowed the design of PR systems that are compact enough to be operated onboard of moving platforms such as cars [1] and airplanes [2], [3]. Deploying PR systems on <b>maritime</b> <b>platforms</b> could enable covert surveillance of small land or sea based targets in littoral environment. A receiver mounted on such a platform may be subjected to highly non-linear motions. In this case a reference signal generated under the assumption of a static scenario may de-correlate from measured Doppler shifted surveillance channel and consequently degrade the PR systems detection performance. Compensation of these detrimental effects requires highly sampled and accurate measurements of the vessels Doppler shift with respect to the transmitter. To study these effects a two channel PR system for DVB-T broadcast reception has been deployed on a small boat to acquire platform motion data in a littoral environment. Based on the data gathered in this trial, a robust method for the Doppler estimation was developed, which uses the DVB-T standards OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signal features. The validity of this approach is verified with data gathered simultaneously from onboard IMU (Internal Motion Units) data...|$|R
