40|$|We {{examine the}} wealth {{effects of the}} {{announcement}} of issues {{of different types of}} convertible securities by UK firms and find significant negative effects on shareholder wealth. We however, also find that when the sample is partitioned by <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> privately placed convertible bonds, in contrast to previous research, exhibit a negative impact on firm wealth. Further, we also find negative wealth effects for firms that issue convertible securities to refinance previous debt or finance specific acquisitions. However announcements of convertible bond issues, for the purpose of financing capital expenditure schemes, show significant positive wealth effects. Finally, we find mixed support for testable predictions of the main theoretical models relating cross-sectional firm characteristics of convertible bond issuers to abnormal returns.

40|$|The paper reviews {{evidence}} from the USA and UK on seasoned equity offers (SEOs) and rights issues. There are two main avenues of research: first, the market reaction to announcements of SEOs, and the related questions of the price elasticity of demand for new shares and the timing of issues; second, the costs of issuing and choice of issuing method. The negative reaction to announcements is well documented and the evidence suggests it is more due to an issue being a signal of overvaluation than to inelastic demand. Other findings are less well understood. The shares of issuers underperform appreciably in the long term, and {{there is evidence that}} market receptiveness to new issues varies. Companies tend to choose the most expensive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> both in terms of direct costs and negative market reaction. US companies use underwritten non-rights, through underwriting increases the direct costs. A possible explanation is that certification of issue value by the sponsor is more credible with non-rights issues in the USA and underwritten rights in the UK than with the apparently cheaper alternatives. seasoned equity offers, rights issues, investment banking,...|$|E

THE OBJECTIVE AIMS ARE TWO: THE FIRST REFERS TOTHE PROPOSED METHOD OF PREPARATION AND ISSUE OF SEGMENT REPORTING, SCIENTIFICALLY ACCEPTABLE, THE SECOND REFERS TO THE PREPARATION OF SEGMENT REPORTINGFOR INTERNAL USE, BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS. THE FIRMS' ATTITUDE TO SEGMENT REPORTING IS EXAMINED. THE <b>METHOD</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ISSUE</b> SEGMENT REPORTS COMPRISES THREE STAGES: A) DETERMINATION OF SEGMENTS THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND GROUPING OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS / SERVICES; B) CALCULATION OF THE CORRESPONDING DATA BY SEGMENT; C) SELECTION OF ISSUE OF THE IMPORTANT SEGMENTS.

50|$|There are two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> credit. The issuer can {{market the}} {{securities}} {{directly to a}} buy and hold investor such as most money market funds. Alternatively, it can sell the paper to a dealer, who then sells the paper in the market. The dealer market for commercial paper involves large securities firms and subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Most of these firms also are dealers in US Treasury securities. Direct issuers of commercial paper usually are financial companies that have frequent and sizable borrowing needs and find it more economical to sell paper {{without the use of}} an intermediary. In the United States, direct issuers save a dealer fee of approximately 5 basis points, or 0.05% annualized, which translates to $50,000 on every $100 million outstanding. This saving compensates for the cost of maintaining a permanent sales staff to market the paper. Dealer fees tend to be lower outside the United States.|$|R

Calhoun said that he attempted to [...] "accommodate everybody on the lake - depending upon the shape of his lot." [...] Because numerous lake lots had had curved boundaries, Calhoun said that the city was compelled to guarantee equal access from all lots regardless of shape. Guin stood with Calhoun: [...] "The criteria that I used, and the concept of this design, was to try to create equity among the owners of the adjacent lots around that cove. Each one should have access to the water, whereby he could build a pier."
