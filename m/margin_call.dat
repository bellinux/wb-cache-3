5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having marital problems when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve turned her back on Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his <b>margin</b> <b>call.</b> Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder than he would like to admit. Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

25|$|All Is Lost {{was written}} and {{directed}} by J. C. Chandor, his second feature film, following 2011's <b>Margin</b> <b>Call.</b> During his time commuting from Providence, Rhode Island to New York City, Chandor developed the idea for All Is Lost. After meeting Robert Redford at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival where <b>Margin</b> <b>Call</b> premiered, Chandor asked the veteran actor to be in the film. On February 9, 2012, Redford's casting was confirmed for All Is Lost as its only cast member. In addition to there being only one actor in the film, Redford also stated that the film has no dialogue, although there are a few spoken lines. For these reasons, the shooting script was only 31 pages long.|$|E
25|$|Some U.S. exchanges {{also use}} the term “maintenance margin”, which in effect defines by how much {{the value of the}} initial margin can reduce before a <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> is made. However, most non-US brokers only use the term “initial margin” and “variation margin”.|$|E
25|$|All Is Lost is a 2013 {{survival}} drama film {{written and}} directed by J. C. Chandor. The film stars Robert Redford as a man lost at sea.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} between contracting and equilibrium pricing when risk- averse hedgers purchase insurance from risk-neutral investors subject to moral hazard. Moral hazard limits risk-sharing. In the individually optimal contract, <b>margins</b> are <b>called</b> (after bad news) to improve risk-sharing. But <b>margin</b> <b>calls</b> depress the price of investors' assets, affecting other investors negatively. Because of this fire-sale externality, {{there is too much}} use of margins in the market equilibrium compared to the utilitarian optimum. Moreover, equilibrium multiplicity can arise: In a pessimistic equilibrium, hedgers who fear low prices request high margins to obtain more insurance. Large <b>margin</b> <b>calls</b> trigger large price drops, confirming initial pessimistic expectations. Finally, moral hazard generates endogenous market incompleteness, raises risk premia, and induces contagion between asset classes...|$|R
25|$|The {{price of}} gold bullion fell {{dramatically}} on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the European Central Bank (ECB) would force Cyprus to sell its gold reserves in response to its financial crisis. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> selling accelerated.

2500|$|If {{the margin}} account goes below a certain value {{set by the}} Exchange, then a <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> is made and the account owner must {{replenish}} the margin account. This process is known as marking to market. Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e. the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the [...] "caller." ...|$|E
50|$|Whilst in {{the past}} the Commonwealth Bank sent <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> notices out to Storm clients, the advisor or both, the banks failure to issue <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> notices at the {{critical}} time was one of the major influences in late 2008 that triggered the eventual collapse of Storm. The banks failure to issue <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> notices together with its inability to reconcile the correct financial position of each client ultimately led to many clients passing through their <b>margin</b> <b>call</b> trigger points and ending in negative equity.|$|E
5000|$|On August 7, {{an analyst}} with Deutsche Bank {{downgraded}} Thornburg Mortgage to [...] "Sell", based upon concerns that the company could be faced with increasing <b>margin</b> <b>calls</b> despite the high rating of its mortgage backed securities. [...] Beginning August 9 these same securities experienced a [...] "sudden and unprecedented" [...] decline in value, along {{with an increase in}} <b>margin</b> <b>calls.</b> [...] In response, during the week beginning August 13 the company stopped accepting loan applications, sold US$20.5 billion of its mortgage backed securities portfolio (in doing so incurring a capital loss of US$930 million), mitigated the potential for <b>margin</b> <b>calls</b> by reducing its repurchase borrowings and delayed payment of a previously announced stock dividend from August 15 to September 17. [...] The company's stock price closed 47% lower when the delayed dividend payment was announced on August 14, but {{over the next few days}} regained most of those losses. [...] A couple of weeks later the company also raised US$500 million through a preferred share offering, a move described as [...] "a desperate attempt to stay afloat", and began accepting applications again.|$|R
50|$|Short squeezes result when short sellers {{cover their}} {{positions}} on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen {{to a point where}} short sellers must make <b>margin</b> <b>calls,</b> or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional <b>margin</b> <b>calls</b> and short covering.|$|R
