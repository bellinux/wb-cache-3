In doing so, it is necessary to separate variation between users from variation between interfaces. The a parameter is typically positive and close to zero, and sometimes ignored in characterizing average performance.

50|$|In mathematics, the {{exponential}} response formula (ERF), {{also known}} as exponential response and complex replacement, is a method used to find a particular solution of a non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation of any order. The exponential response formula is applicable to non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients if the function is polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential or {{the combination of the}} three. The general solution of a non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation is a superposition of the general solution of the associated homogeneous ODE and a particular solution to the non-homogeneous ODE. Alternative methods for solving ordinary differential equations of higher order are method of undetermined coefficients and <b>method</b> <b>variation</b> of parameters.|$|E

The <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> of fractal dimension (FD) estimation {{is a measure of}} texture that can resolve subtle textural contrasts as well as edge features that are otherwise difficult to discern. Application of the <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> to synthetic fractal datasets highlighted its ability to distinguish textural contrasts when using local estimates of FD. The <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> was also able to enhance thin linear anomalies, linear ramp anomalies and sinusoidal ramp anomalies contained in synthetic datasets. The <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> clearly resolved these features even in the presence of Gaussian noise. The results demonstrated that smaller window sizes will more effectively discriminate and enhance edges. Application of the <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> on the Ghanzi-Chobe aeromagnetic dataset highlighted features that were not resolved in the greyscale total magnetic intensity image. Comparison of the <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> with standard derivative-based enhancements showed that the <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> enhanced similar trends but with greater clarity. It also enhanced features that were not revealed by horizontal- and vertical-derivative images.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 48). The overlapping <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> {{algorithm is}} a {{restructuring of the}} standard <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> for estimating fractal dimensions as proposed by Benoit Dubuc in 1989. This restructuring was created to remove redundant computations from the <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> algorithm when attempting to compute many fractal dimension estimates for regions where the fractal windows overlap. Thus the overlapping <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> is more computationally efficient at computing overlapping fractal windows of a Digital Elevation Model or DEM in two dimensions than a brute force approach using the <b>variation</b> <b>method.</b> The algorithm opens up the possibility of handling much larger DEMs than was previously possible. This is accomplished by {{reducing the number of}} comparisons needed to compute the variation in surface roughness of the DEM by one to two orders of magnitude. This thesis focuses on DEMs of large areas of coral reefs as its primary data set. This is one of many possible applications of the overlapping <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> where researchers are interested in how the surface roughness varies from region to region. The result is the new algorithm can compute large sets of fractal dimension estimates one to two orders of magnitude faster than by using the standard <b>variation</b> <b>method</b> to compute the same data. Further the concept of data parallelization is applied to allow computation speed to scale with available resources. This two pronged approach to generating multiple fractal dimension estimates allows us to generate data in days instead of months or year...|$|R
