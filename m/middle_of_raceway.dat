The influence factors, blasting volume, charging rate which simulates coke consumption, bed packing height have been considered. The {{results show that the}} shape <b>of</b> <b>raceway</b> is ellipsoidal and blasting volume, charging rate, bed packing height have effect on raceway.

40|$|The raceway in the {{ironmaking}} {{blast furnace}} is a void {{in front of}} the hot blast tuyeres where coke and supplementary fuel burn to supply heat to the ironmaking process. The air velocity through the tuyeres is high (around 200 m/s) and this causes the coke particles to circulate in a rotating flow field inside the raceway. The size and shape <b>of</b> the <b>raceway</b> determine the gas flow dstribution, the reactions that occur, and the temperature profiles in {{the lower part of the}} blast furnace. It is for these reasons that the raceway has been extensively researched in the past.. Literature review revealed that forming and breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway</b> has not been yet studied. So, in the present study, we have concentrated our effort to study the formation and breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway</b> for different blast and bed parameters. The experiments have been performed in two-dimensional glass models. An attempt has been made to develop a correlation for each case. The formation of the void has been studied with change in parameters like density and size of the particles, bed height. The theory of the void formation has been derived from the fundamental principles. The formation <b>of</b> <b>raceway,</b> has been studied with the change in blast parameters like particle density and diameter, bed height and model width. It was found that when raceway is formed there is a sudden increment in pressure drop. The condition for breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway,</b> has been studied with change in blast and bed parameters like particle size and density, bed height and model width. It was observed that during the breaking <b>of</b> <b>raceway,</b> pressure decreases continuously. New semi-empirical correlations have been developed using dimensional analysis for formation of void, formation <b>of</b> <b>raceway,</b> and breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway.</b> The raceway growth also characterized with change in model width, flow rate, particle diameter, density of the particles and bed height. A few experimental results have been compared with published data. New semi-empirical correlation have been developed using dimensional analysis for the growth <b>of</b> <b>raceway.</b> Velocity <b>of</b> the gas exiting from top of the bed has been measured with the help of hot wire anemometer. It was observed that the velocity leaving from the bed is more on top <b>of</b> the <b>raceway</b> compared to the velocity leaving from the other parts of the bed. High velocity was observed near the wall of the model. Coefficient of wall-friction and angle of internal friction in presence and absence of gas were studied to explain the effect of bed height on formation of the void and raceway. It was observed that in presence of gas, coefficient of friction between the particles and wall and angle of internal friction between particles decreased, compared to the values in absence of gas. To study the effect of mixed particles, on the formation and breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway,</b> different sized particles in fixed proportion were taken. It was found that the experiments were more reproducible in case of uniform sized particles compared to mixed particles. It was also observed that for the same average particle diameter, mixture particles requires more velocity to form the void and raceway. New semi-empirical correlations have been developed using dimensional analysis for the formation of void, formation <b>of</b> <b>raceway,</b> growth <b>of</b> the <b>raceway,</b> and breaking <b>of</b> the <b>raceway.</b> Finally, an attempt has been made to quantify the various forces (pressure, bed weight & frictional forces) present in the raceway. Results show that further investigation is required in quantifying these forces properly...|$|R

The whole physical parameters field can be used to describe the raceway boundary precisely, but all of the physical parameter fields are obtained from numerical simulation so far and there isn’t a specific criterion to define the raceway boundary. In this study, a new digital image processing technology has been developed to define the raceway boundary in cold model of blast furnace.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaFor {{many years}} VME {{has been the}} {{platform}} of choice for high-performance, real-time data acquisition systems. VME’s longevity has been made possible in part by timely enhancements which have expanded system bandwidth and allowed systems to support ever increasing throughput. One {{of the most recent}} ANSI-standard extensions of the VME specification defines <b>RACEway,</b> a system <b>of</b> dynamically switched, 160 Mbyte/second board-to-board interconnects. In typical systems RACEway increases the internal bandwidth of a VME system by an order of magnitude. Since this bandwidth is both scaleable and deterministic, it is particularly well suited to high-performance, real-time systems. The potential <b>of</b> <b>RACEway</b> for very high-performance (200 Mbps to 1 Gbps) real-time systems has been recognized by both the VME industry {{and a growing number of}} system integrators. This recognition has yielded many new RACEway-ready VME products from more than a dozen vendors.

This paper {{researches}} on {{the theory}} of the crown modification <b>of</b> cylinder-roller bearing <b>raceway</b> using electrochemical abrasive belt grinding (ECABG) technology, and establishes relevant experimental device. The range of processing parameters with a better surface roughness can be obtained through experiments.

Considering the controllability of processing parameters and demand of the surface quality, the processing parameters such as interelectrode voltage, electrolyte, interelectrode gap and cathode geometry are invariable in the experiment, and processing time is changed to control the crown value. The experimental results show that ECABG can enhance the surface quality <b>of</b> <b>raceway</b> to a great degree, and obtain the ideal forming crown at the same time under the optimum technological parameters.

A computational {{model in which}} the clearance of bearing is first included is presented for determining the contact force distribution and static load-carrying capacity of a double row four-point contact ball bearing which is subjected to the combined radial, axial and overturning moment loadings. The relation between the negative axial clearance and the contact force distribution is analyzed. The static load-carrying capacity curves are established, {{and the effects of}} the changes in negative axial clearance, curvature radius coefficient <b>of</b> <b>raceway</b> groove and initial contact angle on the static load-carrying capacity are analyzed. The results show that, with the increase in the absolute value of negative clearance, the maximum contact load decreases first and then increases. The clearance values in the range of − 0. 2  mm– 0  mm have little effect on the static load-carrying capacity of bearing.
