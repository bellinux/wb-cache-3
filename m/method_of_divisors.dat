The reform is planned to be implemented after the 2020 census figures are available and not expected to take effect before 2022. In the meantime, another redistricting and apportionment passed in 2017 is designed to keep the maximum malapportionment ratio in the House of Representatives below 2. In the FPTP tier, it changes 97 districts and cuts six without adding any; in the proportional tier, four [...] "blocks" [...] lose a seat each; the total number of seats in the lower house is cut to 465, 289 majoritarian seats and 176 proportional seats.|$|R
40|$|Given a moduli {{problem with}} a nice coarse moduli space, {{which is the most}} {{intrinsic}} and natural divisor on this moduli space? We describe a general <b>method</b> <b>of</b> constructing effective <b>divisors</b> on a large class of moduli spaces using the syzygies of the parametrized objects. In this paper we treat the case of the moduli space of curves and we compute the slope of a doubly infinite sequence <b>of</b> Koszul <b>divisors</b> on M_g. We present a single formula which apart from giving myriads of new counterexamples to the Harris-Morrison Slope Conjecture it also encodes virtually all interesting divisor class calculations on M_g. In particular our formula specializes to earlier results due to Harris-Mumford (the case <b>of</b> the Brill-Noether <b>divisors),</b> Eisenbud-Harris (Giseker-Petri divisors), Khosla as well as to our earlier counterexamples to the Slope Conjecture obtained using K 3 surfaces and Hurwitz schemes. We also describe five ways <b>of</b> constructing Koszul <b>divisors</b> on moduli spaces of pointed curves. As an application, we improve most of Logan's results on the Kodaira type of M_{g,n}.
