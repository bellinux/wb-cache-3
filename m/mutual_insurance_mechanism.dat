40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among contemporary social scientists that social trust is important for economic and institutional development because it facilitates cooperation and collective action {{among the members of}} a community (Coleman, 1988; Putnam et. al., 1993). Yet, the historical determinants of trust remain relatively unexplored. In particular, the literature has generally overlooked the impact of environmental factors on the historical emergence of cultural norms of generalized trust. Previous research in cultural anthropology has emphasized the importance of social learning and the role of culture in human adaptation to the natural environment (Boyd and Richerson, 1995). The norms and values that members of a community adopt evolve according to which norms yield the highest payoff in terms of survival probabilities. These, in turn, depend on the external conditions they face, particularly on the risks and challenges of the natural environment they are exposed to. In this paper I propose and test a theory of the emergence of norms of cooperation and mutual trust based on insurance motives. In particular, I examine the historical role of climate variability in shaping individuals ’ incentives to participate in risk-sharing and <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E

First, we consider ex ante risk management and ex post risk-coping behaviors separately, showing evidence from the Asian economic crisis, earthquakes, and tsunami disasters. Second, we differentiate idiosyncratic risks which can be diversified away through <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> from non-diversifiable aggregate risks which characterize a disaster. We also discuss the difficulties of designing index-type insurance against natural disasters, which are often rare, unforeseen events. Then, we investigate the role of self-insurance against large-scale disasters under which formal or informal <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are largely ineffective. Credit accessibility is identified as one of the key factors facilitating risk-coping strategies. We also discuss public policy issues of emergency aid after disasters.

40|$|The {{interbank market}} is {{important}} for the efficient functioning of the financial system, transmission of monetary policy and therefore ultimately the real economy. In particular, it facilitates banks' liquidity management. This paper aims at extending the literature which views interbank markets as <b>mutual</b> liquidity <b>insurance</b> <b>mechanism</b> by taking into account persistence of liquidity shocks. Following a theory of long-term interbank funding a financial system which is modeled as a micro-founded agent based complex network interacting with a real economic sector is developed. The model features interbank funding as an over-the-counter phenomenon and realistically replicates financial system phenomena of network formation, monetary policy transmission and endogenous money creation. The framework is used to carry out an optimal policy analysis in which the policymaker maximizes real activity via choosing the optimal interest rate in a trade-off between loan supply and financial fragility. It is shown that the interbank market renders the financial system more efficient relative to a setting without <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> against persistent liquidity shocks and therefore plays a crucial role for welfare...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a <b>mutual</b> fire <b>insurance</b> <b>{{mechanism}}</b> used in Andorra,which {{is called}} La Crema {{in the local}} language. This mechanism relies on households' announced property values {{to determine how much}} a household is reimbursed {{in the case of a}} fire and how payments are apportioned among other households. The only Pareto e±cient allocation reachable through the mechanism requires that all households honestly report the true value of their property. However, such honest reporting is not an equilibrium except in the extreme case where the property values are identical for all households. Nevertheless, as the size of the society becomes large, the benefits from deviating from truthful reporting vanish, and all of the non-degenerate equilibria of the mechanism are nearly truthful and approximately Pareto efficient...|$|R
