5|$|The {{integers}} form a commutative ring whose {{elements are}} the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers {{can be added}} or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a+b = b+a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3×a=1.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E

25|$|In the {{symmetric}} TSP, {{the distance}} between two cities is the same in each opposite direction, forming an undirected graph. This symmetry halves the number of possible solutions. In the asymmetric TSP, paths may not exist in both directions or the distances <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> forming a directed graph. Traffic collisions, one-way streets, and airfares for cities with different departure and arrival fees are examples of how this symmetry could break down.|$|E

However, depending on the discrepancies between modalities, there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> forms of stimuli fusion: integration, partial integration, and segregation. To fully understand the other two types, {{we have to use}} causal inference model without {{the assumption}} as cue combination model.

The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories. Given more detailed and reliable data {{from other parts of}} the universe, the roots of astrobiology itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged.|$|E
25|$|Code {{optimization}} can be also broadly {{categorized as}} platform-dependent and platform-independent techniques. While the latter ones are effective on {{most or all}} platforms, platform-dependent techniques use specific properties of one platform, or rely on parameters depending on the single platform or even on the single processor. Writing or producing {{different versions of the}} same code for different processors might therefore be needed. For instance, in the case of compile-level optimization, platform-independent techniques are generic techniques (such as loop unrolling, reduction in function calls, memory efficient routines, reduction in conditions, etc.), that impact most CPU architectures in a similar way. Generally, these serve to reduce the total instruction path length required to complete the program and/or reduce total memory usage during the process. On the other hand, platform-dependent techniques involve instruction scheduling, instruction-level parallelism, data-level parallelism, cache optimization techniques (i.e., parameters that differ among various platforms) and the optimal instruction scheduling <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> even on different processors of the same architecture.|$|E

500|$|At the time, an {{improved}} tubular {{version of the}} original Geiger counter, invented by Hans Geiger in 1908, had just been developed by his student Walther Müller. [...] These Geiger–Müller tubes (GM tubes or counters) made possible Bothe's investigations. [...] With Occhialini's help {{in the construction of}} GM tubes, and {{with the aid of a}} practical coincidence circuit, Rossi confirmed and extended the results of Bothe, who invited him to visit Berlin in the summer of 1930. [...] Here, with financial support arranged by Garbasso, Rossi collaborated on further investigations of cosmic ray penetration. [...] He also studied Carl Størmer's mathematical description of the trajectories of charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field. [...] On the basis of these studies, he realised that the intensity of cosmic rays coming from eastward directions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from that of westward ones. [...] From Berlin, he submitted the first paper suggesting that observations of this East-West effect could not only confirm that cosmic rays are charged particles, but also determine the sign of their charge.|$|E
500|$|Although {{raised in}} a Jewish home, Ginsburg became non-observant when she was {{excluded}} from the minyan for mourners {{after the death of}} her mother. There was a [...] "house full of women", but Ginsburg, as a woman, was excluded. Orthodox Judaism requires that ten bar mitzvahed men be present for a minyan, and women are excluded from being counted. She notes that her attitude <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> following her attendance at a bat mitzvah ceremony in a more liberal stream of Judaism where the rabbi and cantor were both women. In March 2015, Ginsburg and Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt released [...] "The Heroic and Visionary Women of Passover", an essay highlighting the roles of five key women in the saga: [...] "These women had a vision leading out of the darkness shrouding their world. They were women of action, prepared to defy authority to make their vision a reality bathed {{in the light of the}} day." [...] In addition, she decorates her chambers with an artist's rendering of the Hebrew phrase from Deuteronomy, [...] "Zedek, zedek, tirdof", ("Justice, justice shall you pursue") as a reminder of her heritage and professional responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Bob Weinstein {{approached}} Craven {{early in}} the planning stages, because he felt Craven's previous work in the genre that combined horror and comedy would make him the perfect person to bring Williamson's script to screen. [...] Craven was already busy developing a remake of The Haunting and was considering distancing himself from the horror genre. He was growing weary of what he felt was an inherent misogyny and violence in it. Weinstein approached other directors, including Robert Rodriguez, Danny Boyle, George A. Romero, and Sam Raimi. Williamson said that they [...] "didn't get it"; he was concerned that having read the script, many of the directors believed the film to be purely a comedy. [...] Craven was approached again but continued to pass in spite of repeated requests. When production of The Haunting collapsed, Craven was freed from that commitment and found himself {{in need of a}} project. Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore had signed on to the film at her own request. When he heard an established actress wanted to be involved, Craven reasoned that Scary Movie <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from other films of the genre he had previously undertaken, and he contacted Weinstein to accept the job.|$|E

500|$|The debate {{started in}} 1999 with an {{exchange}} of letters in Scientific American between Walter L. Wagner, and F. Wilczek, Institute for Advanced Study, {{in response to a}} previous article by M. Mukerjee. The media attention unfolded with an article in U.K. Sunday Times of July 18, 1999 by J. Leake, closely followed by articles in the U.S. media. The controversy mostly ended with the report of a committee convened by the director of Brookhaven National Laboratory, J. H. Marburger, ostensibly ruling out the catastrophic scenarios depicted. However, the report left open the possibility that relativistic cosmic ray impact products might behave differently while transiting earth compared to [...] "at rest" [...] RHIC products; and the possibility that the qualitative difference between high-E proton collisions with earth or the moon <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> than gold on gold collisions at the RHIC. Wagner tried subsequently to stop full energy collision at RHIC by filing Federal lawsuits in San Francisco and New York City, but without success. The New York suit was dismissed on the technicality that the San Francisco suit was the preferred forum. The San Francisco suit was dismissed, but with leave to refile if additional information was developed and presented to the court.|$|E

When Gut Records went into administration {{at the end}} of 2008 the band decided to release their next album, Be Human, in a joint venture with their management company (Raw Power) on the Search and Destroy label. The album was distributed by PIAS Records. Fightstar {{released the}}ir first single from Be Human, [...] "The English Way", on 3November 2008 and it topped the UK rock chart. Its video was played on Kerrang! and Scuzz T.V., and topped the MTV2 top 10. The album was co-produced by the band and Carl Bown at Treehouse Studios, Bown's Chesterfield studio. In interviews before its release, Fightstar called the new album [...] "quite different" [...] from their previous releases; Charlie Simpson said that they wanted to experiment with a [...] "rock opera" [...] sound, including strings and a choir. Simpson said that although it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> it would still be a Fightstar album with their trademark dark, heavy elements. The band supported Feeder for the first part of their UK tour, which began on 21 October 2008. Drummer Jason Bowld of the British metal band Pitchshifter filled in for Omar Abidi on their UK tour while Abidi recovered from a broken wrist; Abidi returned to touring with the band in early 2009. Due to the drummer's injury, Simpson played drums on six tracks of the new album while Abidi wrote the drum parts and oversaw Simpson's playing.|$|E
