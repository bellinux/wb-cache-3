500|$|In November 1961, John Houbolt {{had sent}} a paper advocating lunar orbit {{rendezvous}} (LOR) to Robert Seamans, the deputy administrator of NASA. As Shea remembered, [...] "Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt's letter to Brainerd Holmes [...] Holmes put the letter on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> said: Figure it out." [...] Shea {{became involved in the}} lunar orbit rendezvous decision {{as a result of this}} letter. While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous, Shea [...] "prided himself", according to space historians Murray and Cox, [...] "on going wherever the data took him". In this case, the data took him to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group, and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering.|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> <b>And</b> I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things you want to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} again at <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> made another attempt to write to Mr. Playmore.|$|E
60|$|I went {{quickly to}} <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{unlocked}} it, <b>and</b> {{took out a}} photograph.|$|R
6000|$|... "And all mine is yours, of course. But, Celia, {{how could}} he do it? He can't pick locks, I know, for we fussed over <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> together, <b>and</b> had to break it after all." ...|$|R
60|$|After Mr. Lott's {{departure}} on Friday, which, fortunately, was pay-day, I set <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> {{in order}} <b>and</b> confided to Minikin written instructions concerning all matters unfinished.|$|R
60|$|I {{caught up}} {{a bundle of}} papers from <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> stole softly from the room. Ray was close at hand, and I called to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{breath of}} fresh air did me good. I {{returned}} to <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> was able once more to assume my habitual dignity and presence of mind.|$|E
60|$|He {{also carried}} a malacca cane, which he {{deposited}} upon <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> a gold-rimmed spy-glass which, {{with a gesture}} of supreme affectation, he raised to his eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{must give}} you a purse and some money, and you must never go out without it, and don't mind {{spending}} a little money now and then, and giving away a penny when you feel inclined. Give me <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> the keys." ...|$|R
60|$|Obedient at last, {{he raised}} himself from <b>my</b> dishevelled <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> {{permitted}} me to half lift {{him to the}} floor. The gale of his grief had blown away his words; his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief. Reminiscence died in him--at least, the coherent part of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have any {{of you who are}} {{interested}} in it, try to express this principle in a few sentences, on paper, and lay it on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> to-morrow, <b>and</b> I will read what you write. You will find it very difficult to express it. Now you may lay aside your books. It will be pleasanter for you if you do it silently." ...|$|R
60|$|At this {{he seized}} my coat, grovelled upon <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> burst again into {{distressful}} weeping. Whatever it was about, I {{said to myself}} that his grief was genuine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you be so}} good as {{to write}} that question, {{and put it on}} <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> then, at the regular time, I will answer it to all the school." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> I leaned forward, with my {{elbows on the}} table, the finger-tips of one hand in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|E
6000|$|Before noon {{the next}} day she brought in the speech, neatly typewritten, and laid it on <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Looking up <b>and</b> {{catching}} her eye just as she was about to withdraw, I was suddenly impelled to ask:--"Well, {{what did you think of}} it?" ...|$|R
30|$|Showing gradual {{movement}} in “innovation journeys” from gestation to start-up phase.

60|$|Oh! hypocrite! hypocrite! If {{he could}} only have seen {{me a few minutes}} before, {{stealing}} along {{in the shadow of the}} shrubs outside looking about in the darkness till I had found them, and holding them passionately to my lips. They were in my pocket then, wrapped in a lace handkerchief. They are in a secret drawer of <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> now, <b>and</b> there will they remain forever. I do not mind confessing that they are very precious to me. But he does not know that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make-believe. Make-believe." [...] The phrase and Britten's squat {{gestures}} haunted me as I walked homeward alone. I {{went to my}} {{room and}} stood before <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> surveyed papers and files and Margaret's admirable equipment of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no. It is {{only for}} little Teddy Coggan. I have promised him something, {{and this will be}} a pretty {{surprise}} for him. Liddy, you may as well bring me <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> I'll direct it at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Among {{the other}} offenses," [...] {{continued}} the little man, [...] "of which I now find my scoundrel of an apprentice {{to have been}} guilty, was the enormity of picking the lock of <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> prying into my private papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Dirk, [...] "what with daggers, swoonings, and scoldings {{it slipped}} my mind," [...] and drawing the paper from his tunic {{he cut the}} silk and broke the seals. [...] "I had forgotten," [...] he went on, looking at the sheets of words interspersed with meaningless figures; [...] "it is in our private cypher, as Elsa said, or at least most of it is. Get the key from <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> son, <b>and</b> let us set to work, for our task {{is likely to be}} long." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} practical, single-page {{checklist}} {{designed to improve}} the quality of articles submitted to finance journals. We argue that a combination of factors conspire to produce submissions of early-stage, unpolished articles. These factors include overconfidence, unwarranted optimism, the impatient desire to “get it off <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> ” <b>and</b> the competing attraction of initiating new projects. Unpolished submissions can, however, waste scarce resources on multiple fronts and destroy option-like upside potential embedded in the review process.

6000|$|The janitor {{took the}} {{manuscript}} and disappeared. I turned to <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> again <b>and</b> was soon absorbed in arranging a full-page display of plumbers' furnishings for the advertising. It {{had occurred to}} me that by arranging the picture matter in a neat device with verses from [...] "Home Sweet Home" [...] running through it in double-leaded old English type, I could set up a page that would be the delight of all business readers and make this number of the magazine a conspicuous success. My mind was so absorbed that I scarcely noticed that over an hour elapsed before the janitor returned.|$|R
60|$|April 7.--The same history occurs; <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> my exercise. I am {{a perfect}} automaton. Bonaparte runs {{in my head}} from {{seven in the morning}} till ten at night without intermission. I wrote six leaves to-day and {{corrected}} four proofs.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{came after}} dinner one evening and talked in the office. She made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big window. I sat at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.|$|E
60|$|Enclosed in {{the letter}} was the oblong {{envelope}} he spoke of, which I carefully opened. It contained only a small quantity of pale pink powder, which emitted a faint pungent odor. I locked it up in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> destroyed the letter.|$|E
6000|$|But, sometimes, when I {{took her}} up, {{and felt that}} she was lighter in my arms, a dead blank feeling came upon me, as if I were {{approaching}} to some frozen region yet unseen, that numbed my life. I avoided the recognition of this feeling by any name, or by any communing with myself; until one night, when it was very strong upon me, and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of 'Good night, Little Blossom,' I sat down at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> alone, <b>and</b> cried to think, Oh what a fatal name it was, and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree! ...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{discussed}} in this paper is described in a 1959 paper by John McCarthy as follows: Assume that I am seated at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> at home <b>and</b> I wish {{to go to the}} airport. My car is at my home also. The solution of the problem is to walk to the car and drive the car to the airport. In the spirit of what is now known as the logic approach to AI, McCarthy proposed to address this problem by first giving "a formal statement of the premises" that a reasoning program would use to draw the relevant conclusions. Our goal here is to take a careful look at this episode from the early history of AI and to identify some of the logical and algorithmic ideas related to the airport problem that have emerged over the years. 1. INTRODUCTION The problem {{discussed in}} this paper is described in [McCarthy, 1959] as follows: Assume that I am seated at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> at home <b>and</b> I wish to go to the airport.

60|$|Here is a limping brute of a {{reply to}} your always-welcome Christmas letter! But, as usual, when I have done my day's work, I jump up from <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> rush into air and exercise, and find letter-writing the most {{difficult}} thing in my daily life.|$|E
60|$|So the {{old days}} were over! I looked at <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> {{by the side of}} it was the chair in which she used {{sometimes}} to sit while I read to her. Then I think that I, too, was glad that this change was to come.|$|E
60|$|I walked {{deliberately}} to <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{took out}} such {{of its contents}} as were my own property, put them in my pocket, locked the <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> placed the key on the top.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{explained}} here that my cabin had {{the form of}} the capital letter L, the door being within the angle and opening into the short part of the letter. A couch was to the left, the bed place to the right; <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> the chronometers' table faced the door. But anyone opening it, unless he stepped right inside, had no view of what I call the long (or vertical) part of the letter. It contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase; and a few clothes, a thick jacket or two, caps, oilskin coat, and such like, hung on hooks. There was at the bottom of that part a door opening into my bathroom, which could be entered also directly from the saloon. But that way was never used.|$|R
25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to <b>my</b> legislative <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|R
