5|$|A {{bombardment}} from Soviet Russian 120-mm mortars, 57-mm recoilless rifles, {{and phosphorus}} grenades began at 00:30 on May 18. Teullier instructed his radio operator, Sergeant René Novak, to request air-dropped flares and air support, while <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> landed on Alpha and the Mousetrap, but not Pi, where Grézy was in command. Pi continued {{to support the}} other two areas of the outpost with its own <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Bréville, the Germans never seriously {{attempted}} {{to break through the}} airborne division's lines again. The British division only being subjected to sporadic artillery and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b> This lasted until 17August, when the Germans started to withdraw and the 6th Airborne Division advanced to the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san. Gay {{believed he had}} insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b> However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Immediately the American {{forces were}} hit with machine gun and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> {{from the north}} ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in. The first burst of machine gun fire killed Chae and wounded {{most of the other}} commanders, {{including}} Mott. Mott managed {{to make it to the}} ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. <b>Mortar</b> <b>fire</b> knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.|$|E
5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks as the road ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> from the Pakistanis.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from <b>mortar</b> <b>fire,</b> and colonnade columns have been damaged by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E

Shortly after his return to the US, she informed him that she was engaged to an Italian officer. Soon after, he turned to journalism.|$|E
5|$|Later in the morning, No. 6 Commando {{came under}} {{artillery}} and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> from Bréville. The commandos attacked and cleared {{the village of}} Germans, capturing several prisoners, some machine-guns and four artillery pieces. Then they withdrew to their original position. The Germans reoccupied the village and formed their own defensive positions, facing the ridge line defended by the airborne division. Their positions also isolated the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was almost {{cut off from the}} rest of the division.|$|E
5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB {{need not have}} landed, but {{he was one of}} the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E

5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers {{made it into the}} PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell.|$|E
5|$|As the 48th Highlanders secured their {{positions}} west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment {{was involved in}} intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly tied down by German <b>mortar</b> <b>fire,</b> while B Company flanked German positions {{to the north of}} San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defences. On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b> Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82mm <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b> As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on the USS Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{caused a}} special study {{to be made}} of this action because he {{considered}} it so outstanding. He found that the 3d Battalion suffered 229 battle casualties in the first two hours. Of these, 38 troops were killed and 167 wounded, the remainder were attached South Koreans. The battalion aid station reported treating 130 casualties. Other wounded were treated at the 8th Cavalry aid station. Many men with minor wounds did not ask for medical attention until the battle had ended, and there were only five cases of combat shock in contrast to the eighteen on Hill 518. North Korean <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> caused 80 percent of the casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December, the SLA {{launched}} a multi-front offensive against Kilinochchi. This assault {{was defeated by}} the LTTE, who claimed that SLA casualties in this battle were 130 soldiers dead and more than 300 wounded. They also claimed to have captured 28 bodies of army soldiers. However, the SLA denied this and claimed to have had only 25 soldiers killed, 18 missing and 160 wounded while they killed 120 Tigers. Heavy artillery and <b>mortar</b> <b>fire</b> was exchanged between both sides during the battle. Fighting continued for 10 days after this battle, during which period the SLA managed to capture {{some parts of the}} earth bund to the west of Kilinochchi.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment {{prepared}} to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, {{which was one}} of the last areas of resistance in the city. American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel, which was the city's defense headquarters, at point blank range. That night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American <b>mortar</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
