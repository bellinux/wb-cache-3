5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park.
