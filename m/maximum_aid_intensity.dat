40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability. These results are robust to alternative specifications and to the use of different measures of <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and democracy. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the emerging literature and debates on aid, {{within the context}} of expected increases in aid flows to the continent. The trends in ODA flows indicate a reversal in aid flows to the continent since 2000, with subsequent increases in <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and dependence. Although the more recent literature on aid is doubtful if aid only spurs growth in a in a good policy environment, the aid-institutional debate indicates a clear aid-institutional paradox, especially relating to the macroeconomic effects, the fiscal response, the absorptive capacity and the good governance aid debates. The literature further indicates that aid could serve as a barrier to vulnerable societies. From the donors' perspective, it is evident that quantity of aid does not imply quality and that the ultimate responsibility lies with recipient governments to ensure more efficient absorption of aid.

The authors consider a competition over poverty and governance conducted by a non-government organization trying to allocate its funds among potential recipient countries. In its decision-making the NGO also {{takes into account the}} initial conditions each potential recipient faces, including the current quality of governance and wealth (poverty). For example, all else being equal the poorer country will have a higher probability of obtaining funds; or, the better the applicant's governance, the more its gains. Moreover, the <b>maximum</b> <b>aid</b> a country can obtain depends on its wealth. Investment in good governance, the wealth/poverty status of the applicant, and its current quality of governance will, together, determine the funds potential recipients expect to obtain.

The coagulation and flocculation method is used for arsenate removal from drinking water using ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, and ferrous sulfate. The effects of coagulant type and dosage on removal efficiency of arsenate are determined by considering the residual iron after sedimentation and filtration in the effluent. At the same time the impact of the type (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and dosage of organic polymers on the removal efficiency of arsenate was investigated. Residual arsenate concentrations were decreased below 10 mg L- 1 for ferric chloride and ferrous sulfate concentration of 30 and 80 mg L- 1, respectively. Ferric chloride provided minimum and acceptable residual iron concentration (175 mg L- 1) after sedimentation and filtration and it was determined as the most effective and economic coagulant type because it requires lower amounts than the others and produces minimum residual iron. The addition of cationic polyelectrolyte <b>aided</b> <b>maximum</b> arsenate removal efficiency although all types of polymers increased the efficiency of the treatment method. The percentage of removal reached a maximum level at the cationic polyelectrolyte concentration of 2. 5, 2, and 3 mg L- 1 for ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, and ferrous sulfate, respectively...|$|R
