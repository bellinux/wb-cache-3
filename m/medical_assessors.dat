50|$|AMHPs are {{responsible}} for organising, co-ordinating and contributing to Mental Health Act assessments. It is the AMHP's duty, when two medical recommendations have been made, {{to decide whether or}} not to make an application to a named hospital for the detention of the person who has been assessed. To be detained under the Mental Health Act individuals need to be suffering from a mental disorder, the nature or degree of which warrants detention in hospital on the grounds of their health and/or the risk they present to themselves and/or the risk they present to others. The AMHP's role includes arranging for the assessment of the person concerned by two medical practitioners who must be independent of each other and at least one of whom should be a specialist in mental health. Preferably one of the <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> should have previous acquaintance with the person being assessed. Efforts should be made to seek less restrictive alternatives to detention if it is safe and appropriate to do so, such as using an individuals's own support networks, in line with the principle of care in the least restrictive environment. AMHP's are expected to take account of factors such as gender, culture, ethnicity, age, sexuality and disability in their assessments. Efforts should be also made to overcome any communication barriers, such as deafness or the assessors and the assessed not sharing a language, and an interpreter may be required. It is not good practice for one of the assessors to act as interpreter.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Risk {{attitudes and}} {{personality}} traits are known predictors {{of decision making}} among laypersons, but very little is known of their influence among experts participating in organizational decision making. Methods: Seventy-five European <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> were assessed in a field study using the Domain Specific Risk Taking scale and the Big Five Inventory scale. Assessors rated {{the risks and benefits}} for a mock “clinical dossier” specific to their area of expertise, and ordinal regression models were used to assess the odds of risk attitude or personality traits in predicting either the benefit or the risk ratings. Results: An increase in the “conscientiousness” score predicted an increase in the perception of the drug’s benefit, and male assessors gave higher scores for the drug’s benefit ratings than did female assessors. Extraverted assessors saw fewer risks, and assessors with a perceived neutral-averse or averse risk profile saw greater risks. Conclusions: <b>Medical</b> <b>assessors</b> perceive the benefits and risks of medicines via a complex interplay of the medical situation, their personality traits and even their gender. Further research in this area is needed to determine how these potential biases are managed within the regulatory setting...|$|E

40|$|A sociocognitive {{model of}} distal and {{proximal}} predictors of empathic judgments was tested among 100 physicians. The authors hypothesized that physician perceived control would affect empathy ratings via physician communication style. Specifically, physicians with high perceived control would use more open communication and be rated as more empathic. Physicians with low perceived control {{would use a}} controlling communication style and be rated as less empathic. Physicians completed a medical attribution questionnaire prior to a structured patient consultation exercise, during which patients and assessors rated physician empathy. The exercise was audiotaped, transcribed, and content analyzed for verbal behaviors. Support was found for the hypotheses; however, patients, but not <b>medical</b> <b>assessors,</b> associated empathy with reassurance and provision of medical information...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{high quality}} of timely {{delivered}} medical appraisals is crucial for social and other insurances to judge possible occupational reintegration measures for patients with medical conditions who are in danger to lose their job. However, {{little is known about}} the satisfaction of staff of insurance companies with medical appraisals that they have commissioned. Our questionnaire survey prospectively included all medical appraisals arriving at Swiss insurances from FEB to APR 2008. We assessed the satisfaction of the commissioner with medical appraisals performed by <b>medical</b> <b>assessors.</b> In addition, we evaluated the contribution of several factors to overall satisfaction. The unit of sample was the medical appraisal. Findings We analysed 3165 medical appraisals, 2444 (77 %) of them from the public disability insurance, 678 (22 %) from private accident, liability and loss of income insurances and 43 (1 %) from other insurances. Overall satisfaction of staff of insurance companies in Switzerland was high, but satisfaction of the disability insurance with appraisals was generally lower compared to satisfaction of private insurances. The staff of the disability insurance judged time for preparation as too long in 30 %. For staff of private insurance companies 20 % of appraisals were not "worth its price". Well-grounded and comprehensible conclusions were the single most important factor for high overall satisfaction (OR 10. 1; 95 %-CI: 1. 1 - 89. 3). Conclusions From the viewpoint of staff of insurance companies, a relevant part of medical appraisals arrives too late. <b>Medical</b> <b>assessors</b> have to take the specific needs of insurances into account, to perform more appraisals with sound conclusions in due time. </p...|$|E

40|$|Emotional {{involvement}} of the examiner, hostility and mistrust {{on the part of}} the examinees and the long interval since the original events comprise some of the problems facing <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> of survivors of National Socialist persecution. Experience with over 100 such persons confirmed the high incidence of irreversible and usually disabling disorders, mainly functional and psychiatric—“late damage” as it has been designated in recent reports on this subject. The most common disorders encountered in the assessments of 70 survivors are reviewed. A number of organic diseases such as organic brain damage, active tuberculosis and fractures were revealed only after careful search. Recent findings by psychiatric assessors are reviewed; their plea for greater familiarity with late effects in survivors of National Socialist persecution is echoed, and the need for medical, psychiatric and social support of these unfortunate individuals is emphasized...|$|E

40|$|Background. Most post-pubertal women exhibit cellulite, {{particularly}} in the thigh and buttock regions. The prevalence of cellulite has led to many attempts at treatment, including a variety of topical solutions, massage-based therapies, and surgical techniques—most with suboptimal clinical effects. The purpose of this controlled study was to evaluate a novel combination device involving radiofrequency, infrared light, and mechanical tissue manipulation {{for the treatment of}} cellulite. Methods. Twenty adult women (ages 25 – 57 years) of various skin phototypes (I–V), and with moderate bilateral thigh and buttock cellulite, received eight biweekly treatments to a randomly selected side (the contralateral side serving as a non-treated control). A combined bipolar radiofrequency, infrared light, and mechanical suction-based massage device was applied at 20 watts RF, 20 watts IR (700 – 1500 nm) light, and 200 millibar vacuum (750 mmHg negative pressure). Patients were evaluated using standardized digital photography and circumferential leg measurements at baseline, prior to each treatment session, and at one, three, and six months after the final treatment. Clinical improvement scores of comparable photographs using a quartile grading scale (05 v 25 %, 1525 %– 50 %, 2551 %– 75 %, 35 w 75 % improvement) were made independently by two masked <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> after the series of treatments.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} drug {{effectiveness and}} adverse effects in a noninterventional observational cohort study of over 10 000 patients treated with tamsulosin in general medical practice. Methods Using prescription-event monitoring, {{data were collected}} of all prescriptions for tamsulosin issued nationally during June 1996 to January 1998. For each patient entered into the cohort a computerized longitudinal record of exposure was constructed. The outcome data, patient information and an opinion {{about the effectiveness of}} the drug were provided by the prescriber, using a standard questionnaire sent 6 months after the initial prescription for tamsulosin. The incidence of each of almost 2000 events listed in the Drug Safety Research Unit computerized dictionary was calculated and scrutinized by <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> for possible adverse reactions, and any difference determined between the incidence of each event in the first month and subsequent months of exposure. All deaths were followed up to detect possibly drug-related causes. Results Event data were obtained on 12 484 patients, from the 52. 9 % of questionnaires returned and that contained valid event data. Tamsulosin was reported to have been effective in 7428 (78. 3 %) of the 9487 patients in whom the general practitioners expressed an opinion about effectiveness. Suspected adverse drug reactions were reported in only 171 (1. 4 %) of the cohort. Dizziness, headache, malaise and hypotension were common to the reported adverse reactions, reasons for stopping the drug and events of greatest incidence density. None of the 282 deaths that occurred in this elderly cohort were attributed to the drug. Conclusion This study suggests that tamsulosin has a highly acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio. No untoward features not already mentioned in the prescribing guidance were identified...|$|E
40|$|Background. Experts are {{perceived}} to be veridical and to focus only on objective data when evaluating risk. Only a few research studies have attempted to characterize the subjectivity in risk evaluation among experts. Objective. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} expert evaluation of a pharmaceutical drug can be partly explained by dimensions that describe the drug and by individual characteristics. Design. Seventy-five <b>medical</b> <b>assessors</b> in 9 EU countries evaluated a list of 28 pharmaceutical drugs using 4 scales: risk, benefit, seriousness of harm, and patients' knowledge of the risk. They were also given a mock "clinical dossier'' and asked to rate it on 8 dimensions: risk, benefit, worry, magnitude of the exposure, scientific knowledge of the risk, familiarity of the risk, ethical concerns, and risk acceptability. Results. Female assessors perceived significantly higher benefits than men for a large number of the 28 drugs. Principal component analysis of the ratings for the clinical dossiers revealed 2 underlying components: seriousness of harm and scientific evidence. A regression model predicting the risk perception of the drug showed that the variables seriousness of harm (benefit, worry, magnitude of exposure, ethical concerns, and risk acceptability), years of regulatory experience, gender, and type of drug explained 54 % of the variability among assessors. Conclusion. Assessors' view of the risks associated with pharmaceutical drugs is influenced by worry for patient safety, magnitude of patient exposure, and ethical concerns. These dimensions may influence their perceptions of benefit and risk acceptability. Senior assessors are more risk averse than junior assessors, and female assessors seem to be sensitive to the promise of benefit from medicines and consequently may be less risk averse than male assessors...|$|E
