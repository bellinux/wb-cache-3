40|$|Purpose: The {{possible}} clinical applications {{which can}} be performed using a newly developed detector depend on the detector's characteristic performance {{in a number of}} metrics including the dynamic range, resolution, uniformity, and stability. The authors have evaluated a prototype energy resolved fast photon counting x-ray detector based on a silicon (Si) strip sensor used in an edge-on geometry with an application specific integrated circuit to record the number of x-rays and their energies at high flux and fast frame rates. The investigated detector was integrated with a dedicated breast spectral computed tomography (CT) system {{to make use of the}} detector's high spatial and energy resolution and low noise performance under conditions suitable for clinical breast imaging. The aim of this article is to investigate the intrinsic characteristics of the detector, in terms of maximum output count rate, spatial and energy resolution, and noise performance of the imaging system. Methods: The maximum output count rate was obtained with a 50 W x-ray tube with a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>output</b> of 50 kVp at 1. 0 mA. A 109 Cd source, with a characteristic x-ray peak at 22 keV from Ag, was used to measure the energy resolution of the detector. The axial plane modulation transfer function (MTF) was measured using a 67 μm diameter tungsten wire. The two-dimensional (2 D) noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured using flat field images and noise equivalent quanta (NEQ) were calculated using the MTF and NPS results. The image quality parameters were studied as a function of various radiation doses and reconstruction filters. The one-dimensional (1 D) NPS was used to investigate the effect of electronic noise elimination by varying the minimum energy threshold. Results: A maximum output count rate of 100 million counts per second per square millimeter (cps/mm 2) has been obtained (1 million cps per 100 × 100 μm pixel). The electrical noise floor was less than 4 keV. The energy resolution measured with the 22 keV photons from a 109 Cd source was less than 9 %. A reduction of image noise was shown in all the spatial frequencies in 1 D NPS as a result of the elimination of the electronic noise. The spatial resolution was measured just above 5 line pairs per mm (lp/mm) where 10 % of MTF corresponded to 5. 4 mm - 1. The 2 D NPS and NEQ shows a low noise floor and a linear dependence on dose. The reconstruction filter choice affected both of the MTF and NPS results, but had a weak effect on the NEQ. Conclusions: The prototype energy resolved photon counting Si strip detector can offer superior imaging performance for dedicated breast CT as compared to a conventional energy-integrating detector due to its high output count rate, high spatial and energy resolution, and low noise characteristics, which are essential characteristics for spectral breast CT imaging. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|High power fibre laser {{technology}} has {{come of age}} {{over the past five}} years or so, due primarily to developments in fibre design and fabrication and semiconductor pump lasers. Fibre is now emerging as the technology of choice for a wide range of laser applications. Nowhere has the progress been more striking than in terms of the <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> wave <b>output</b> power achievable from a single-mode fibre laser. Up until the start of 2001 the maximum reported output power from such a laser was ~ 110 W. However, since then the reported power levels have risen rapidly and steadily such that by late 2006 values as high as 2. 5 kW were achieved with great prospects for further extension to the 10 kW regime. Far higher power levels than this should be achievable in due course using beam combination technology. Fibre lasers are thus consequently now strong competitors to kW-class 'bulk' and thin disk solid state lasers (for example, Nd:YAG and Yb:YAG) and CO 2 lasers for a wide range of industrial applications including materials processing, aerospace and defense. Relative to these competing technologies fibre lasers benefit from the advantages of compactness, efficiency, beam quality and arguably most importantly ready thermal management due to the large surface-area to volume ratio of the fibre geometry. The fibre laser is thus seen to have the potential to revolutionize both the range of uses and economics of high power laser systems. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{the crystal}} quality of AlGaN {{epitaxial}} layers {{is essential for}} the realization of efficient III-nitride-based light emitting diodes (LEDs) with emission wavelengths below 365 nm. Here, we report on two different approaches to improve the material quality of AlGaN buffer layers for such UV-LEDs, which are known to be effective for the MOVPE growth of GaN layers. Firstly, we grew AlGaN on thin GaN nucleation islands which exhibit a threedimensional facetted structure (3 D GaN nucleation). Lateral overgrowth of these islands results in a lateral bending of´dislocation lines at the growing facets. Secondly, in-situ deposited SiNx interlayers have been used as nano-masks reducing the dislocation density above the SiNx layers. Both approaches result in reduced asymmetric HRXRD w-scan peak widths, indicating a reduced edge-type dislocation density.
