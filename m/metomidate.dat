40|$|The {{efficacy}} of four anesthetic agents—tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222), clove oil, <b>metomidate,</b> and 2 -phenoxyethanol (2 -PE) —was studied in adult, juvenile (133. 3 ± 1. 5 mm, 27. 5 ± 8. 9 g; mean ± SE), and larval Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus. In an initial trial, wild-caught adults were anesthetized {{to a state}} where they {{failed to respond to}} strong tactile stimuli when dosed with 87. 5 – 112. 5 mg/L MS- 222, 25 – 40 mg/L clove oil, 0. 5 – 5. 0 mg/L <b>metomidate,</b> and 125 – 550 mg/L 2 -PE. Optimal doses for anesthesia, defined as those providing the combined shortest induction and recovery times, were similar for larvae and juveniles: 75 – 100 mg/L MS- 222, 40 mg/L clove oil, 5 – 7 mg/L <b>metomidate,</b> and 500 mg/L 2 -PE. All juvenile fish survived 48 h postexposure to each optimal dose. In a longer (24 h) sedation experiment, juvenile Alewives were netted and exposed to low clove oil (2. 5 and 5. 0 mg/L) and <b>metomidate</b> (0. 25 and 0. 50 mg/L) doses, after which plasma cortisol was measured. Fish exposed to the clove oil treatments exhibited a cortisol stress response that was prolonged in the higher-dose treatment.

After becoming accustomed to human contact (being approached and touched), a catheter was implanted in the jugular vein, exteriorized in the neck region. This operation was performed under halothane anaesthesia. After recovery, hourly blood samples were taken over a 27 hour period, and cortisol and beta-endorphin concentrations were measured in the sample plasma. After this reference period, half of the animals were anaesthetized with <b>metomidate,</b> the other half with ketamine, and blood samples were taken at regular intervals. During a second experiment the heart rate was monitored after being anaesthetized as described before. An influence of the type of anaesthesia was observed on the plasma concentration of cortisol, but no effect was observed with respect to the beta-endorphin concentration. A fivefold increase of cortisol concentration was observed after injection with ketamine, while a twofold increase was observed after injection with <b>metomidate.</b> This finding suggests a suppressive effect of <b>metomidate</b> on the plasma cortisol levels.

Methods: The stress-preventing effects of four anaesthetic agents (2 -phenoxyethanol, 600 mg/L; <b>metomidate,</b> 5 mg/L; clove oil, 30 mg/L and MS- 222, 75 mg/L) were evaluated in juvenile specimens of Senegalase sole (Solea senegalensis) subjected to two different types of acute (handling-related) stress: air exposure and net handling (chasing). To assess the stress-preventing effects of the four anaesthetic agents, diverse blood and plasma parameters (haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels) were determined as stress indicators. Fish were treated with the anaesthetic agents before being subjected to the different types of acute stress, and they were sacrificed 30 min, 2 and 24 h later. Control fish were processed in the same way without pretreatment with the anaesthetic agents. Results: The net handling stress was of sufficient intensity to cause {{a significant increase in the}} levels of most of the stress indicators considered. By contrast, air exposure stress only induced significant increases in cortisol and haemoglobin levels. Conclusions: The stress-preventing effects of the anaesthetic agents tested were ranked on the basis of their capacity to prevent increases in the haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels, as follows: <b>metomidate</b> (5 mg/L) > clove oil (30 mg/L) > MS- 222 (75 mg/L) > 2 -phenoxyethanol (600 mg/L) ...|$|E

The optimum anesthetic concentration was determined as: MS 222 75 mg L− 1, EUG 30 mg L− 1 and MTMD 4 mg L− 1. Handling and crowding stress was induced in fish with (SA) and without (S) anesthetic. Plasma cortisol concentration was measured at 0, 30, 90, and 240 min after stress {{and found to}} increase at 30 min post-stress in S and SA MS 222 groups, but not in SA MTMD and SA EUG groups. To test the effects of different anesthetics on neutrophil function, fish were divided into a baseline control group, a group exposed to handling and crowding stress (S) and a stressed anesthetized group (SA). Fish were assayed for neutrophil function before and after stress (24 h, 72 h and 7 days). The degranulation of neutrophil primary granules was measured as exocytosis of myeloperoxidase (MPO) using 3, 3 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate.

40|$|Adrenal lesions {{present a}} {{significant}} diagnostic burden for both radiologists and endocrinologists, {{especially with the}} increasing number of adrenal ‘incidentalomas’ detected on modern computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A key objective is the reliable distinction of benign disease from either primary adrenal malignancy (e. g., adrenocortical carcinoma or malignant forms of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL)) or metastases (e. g., bronchial, renal). Benign lesions may still be associated with adverse sequelae through autonomous hormone hypersecretion (e. g., primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma). Here, identifying a causative lesion, or lateralising the disease to a single adrenal gland, is key to effective management, as unilateral adrenalectomy may offer the potential for curing conditions that are typically associated with significant excess morbidity and mortality. This review considers the evolving role of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in addressing the limitations of traditional cross-sectional imaging and adjunctive techniques, such as venous sampling, in the management of adrenal disorders.

40|$|Studies on {{anaesthesia}} {{are relevant}} for fish welfare. Anaesthetics are routinely used in aquaculture to minimize stress {{and to avoid}} injuries during transport, spawning, vaccination and handling, {{as well as to}} euthanize fish in an ethical way. Anaesthetics are also used during sampling procedures when physiological blood parameters are measured as welfare indicators in farmed fish (Huntingford et al., 2006). Prevention of hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal axis activation through the use of effective anaesthetics is, therefore, of fundamental importance to minimize both stress during aquaculture practices and interferences of blood sampling on measurement of stress indicators. So far, several anaesthetics have been evaluated for aquaculture applications and research, of which the major one are tricaine methanesulphonate MS 222, 2 -phenoxyethanol, quinaldine, benzocaine and <b>metomidate.</b> However, none of these meet the characteristics of an “ideal anaesthetic” (Marking and Meyer, 1985) for sea bass. At present, only few data are available on two new chemical agents used for fish anaesthesia: clove oil (70 - 90 % eugenol) and Aqui-S® (50 % iso-eugenol). The efficacy of clove oil as an anaesthetic was recently evaluated in sea bass by Mylonas et al. (2005), but no data are available on its effects on stress physiology. There are no data on the use of Aqui-S® in sea bass.

40|$|Fish in {{aquaculture}} will {{be exposed}} to water oxygen and carbon dioxide levels {{that they do not}} normally encounter in the wild. These unnatural environmental conditions may be challenging to fish as they may lack the proper coping mechanisms to deal with them. The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate how and to what extent Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) are able to cope with these conditions. All the experiments were performed using in vivo methods to measure blood parameters in Arctic charr and Atlantic cod. The experimental work in this thesis was performed at three different locations with different experimental facilities. The first experiment was carried out at the aquaculture research facility of Hólar University College in Sauðárkrókur, Iceland. In this experiment, Arctic charr were exposed to mild levels of sub- (hypoxia) and supersaturation of water oxygen (hyperoxia) over the course of four days using circular plastic tanks (Paper I). The experiments for Papers II and III were performed at the Marine Research Station of the Norwegian Institute for Water Research at Solbergstrand, Norway, using fibreglass tanks purposely designed for performing experiments with individual fish. In these experiments cod were cannulated in the caudal artery and recovery was followed for two weeks (Paper II), or cod were allowed to recover for 3 - 4 days and then exposed to varying levels of hyperoxia (Paper III). The final experiment was done at the Tromsø Aquaculture Research Station at Ringvassøy, Norway, using a swim tunnel respirometer (Paper IV). In this final experiment, cod were exposed to separate and combined supersaturation of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and hypoxia or hyperoxia. The dorsal aorta cannulation performed on Arctic charr followed a well established cannulation method. However, this method could not be utilized to cannulate Atlantic cod. The caudal artery cannulation procedure developed during the work presented in this thesis proved to be a useful tool for performing in vivo experiments on Atlantic cod. A comparatively long lasting stress response was observed following cannulation of Atlantic cod. A delayed and equal magnitude stress response was observed in <b>metomidate</b> sedated cod compared to unsedated cod. This response indicates that in experiments where a recovery time of less than three days is necessary <b>metomidate</b> sedation should not be used. The use of cannulated Atlantic cod had large benefits compared to sacrificial sampling for certain blood parameters, indicating that sacrificial sampling is inadequate when sampling blood for analysis of plasma pH or K+ concentration. The main findings reported in this thesis are that Arctic charr and Atlantic cod do not decrease their arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO 2) when exposed to hyperoxia to obtain a steady paO 2 similar to that observed in normoxia. Instead, their paO 2 follows the water partial pressure of oxygen (pwO 2). This may make the Arctic charr and Atlantic cod vulnerable to oxidative stress with consequent negative effects on fish health and welfare. In Paper III the proposed increase in oxidative stress in hyperoxia compared to normoxia was confirmed. This indicates that water oxygenation in aquaculture of Atlantic cod and Arctic charr should be limited to keep pwO 2 at normoxic levels. The dependency of paO 2 on pwO 2 indicates that there are no safe levels of hyperoxia in farming of Atlantic cod and Arctic charr; all levels of hyperoxia are likely to cause increased oxidative stress due to increased paO 2. When exposed to hypercapnia, Atlantic cod increased ventilation and consequently paO 2 was closer to pwO 2 in hypercapnia compared to that in normal water CO 2 conditions (normocapnia). Hypercapnia proved to be a more potent ventilatory stimulant than variations in pwO 2 at aquaculture relevant levels. The increased paO 2 associated with hypercapnia may result in Atlantic cod being more vulnerable to oxidative stress when exposed to combined hypercapnia and hyperoxia than cod exposed to hyperoxia alone. This combined situation is especially common in on-land aquaculture facilities where oxygenation is in frequent use. A strict control of oxygen levels in the tank water should efficiently reduce this problem...|$|E
40|$|During {{the life}} cycle as farmed animals there are {{numerous}} situations where fish are subjected to handling and confinement. Netting, weighing, sorting, vaccination, transport and, at the end, slaughter are common events under farming conditions. As research animals fish may also undergo surgical procedures, ranging from tagging, sampling, and small incisions, to larger operations. Under these varying situations treatment with anaesthetic agents might be {{necessary in order to}} ensure the welfare of the fish. Anaesthetic protocols for new species that are introduced to research or cultivation are generally based on protocols developed for the more established species. In Norway the anaesthetic protocols for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), which were introduced to fish farming in the 1980 ’s, have thus been based on protocols used for salmonid species. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has been farmed since the 1960 ’s and is the most important species in Norwegian fish farming. The main objective of the current investigation was to gain more knowledge regarding the effect of anaesthetic agents in farmed fish, with special emphasis on Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut. Large variations in response to anaesthetic agents exist both between and within fish species. Factors such as body weight, water temperature and acute stress may be important for the response and were studied in the current investigation. The anaesthetic agents benzocaine, metacaine (MS- 222), <b>metomidate</b> hydrochloride, isoeugenol, 2 - phenoxyethanol, and quinaldine were used. In Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut the agents were studied with regards to efficacy, assessed as induction and recovery times as well as reaction to handling under anaesthesia. In Atlantic salmon pharmacokinetic properties of the agents were examined. Both in Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut large differences in efficacy between the different anaesthetic treatments were found. Induction and recovery times varied both in relation to body weight and in relation to water temperature. The main trend observed in Atlantic cod at high water temperature was shorter induction and recovery times for all weight groups and treatments. Whereas in Atlantic halibut higher water temperature resulted in shorter induction times, longer recovery times, and increased responsiveness to handling. Atlantic halibut of large body size displayed longer induction times, shorter recovery times, and reduced responsiveness to handling in comparison with fish of smaller body size. However, in Atlantic cod no uniform trend was found in the relationship between the size of the fish and anaesthetic efficacy. In Atlantic cod induction and recovery times were found to increase with increasing body weight for benzocaine and MS- 222. For <b>metomidate</b> the recovery time increased with increasing weight whereas there were no weight related differences in induction time. No differences in either induction or recovery times associated to body weight were found for 2 -phenoxyethanol. The pharmacokinetic study in Atlantic salmon showed that the anaesthetics were rapidly eliminated and that elimination was related to the water soluble characteristics of the agents. The recovery times were shorter in fish that were given artificial gill ventilation. In the assessment of the importance of acute stress prior to anaesthesia of Atlantic cod {{it was found that the}} stress resulted in significantly shorter induction time and prolonged recovery time, as well as deeper anaesthetised fish. The anaesthetic dosage had to be reduced in order to avoid mortality in fish anaesthetised subsequent to acute stress. Anaesthetic protocols for fish have generally comprised one single agent, whereas protocols of human and veterinary medicine comprise combinations of several drugs, each one contributing with effects needed in the anaesthesia. Stress prior to anaesthesia may result in abnormal reactions, as seen in Atlantic cod in the current study, and may require dosage adjustments of drugs both for induction and maintenance. Pre-anaesthetic sedation is therefore commonly used in order to avoid stress and is an integrated part of the veterinary protocols. In the current study, protocols comprising combinations of two anaesthetic agents, one agent to induce sedation followed by one agent to induce anaesthesia, were tested in Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut. In both species combination anaesthesia allowed a reduction of the dosages used for inducing anaesthesia. In Atlantic cod combination anaesthesia resulted in markedly reduced recovery times compared to agents administered individually. In Atlantic halibut combination anaesthesia had no effect on the induction times in small fish in comparison with individual agents, but resulted in significantly shorter recovery times and reduced responsiveness to handling. In Atlantic halibut of large body size combination anaesthesia gave rise to shorter induction times than individual administered agents whereas no uniform trend was observed in recovery times and no differences in responsiveness to handling were noticed. Anaesthetic agents are commonly used in fish farming to avoid stress during various farming practices. While several studies report that anaesthetic agents are effective in reducing the stress associated with confinement and handling, there are also reports indicating that the exposure to anaesthetics may in itself induce a stress response, measured by increased levels of cortisol. In order to examine stress induced by exposure to anaesthetic agents the release of cortisol to water following anaesthetic exposure was examined in Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut and Atlantic salmon. In this examination the fish were not subjected to any concomitant handling in connection to anaesthesia or sampling. The plasma cortisol concentration during anaesthesia was examined in Atlantic salmon, however this examination included some degree of handling. All of the anaesthetics tested induced a release of cortisol to water in all three species, with maximum release rates measured 0. 5 - 1 hour post exposure. This also complied with the plasma cortisol levels measured in Atlantic salmon. MS- 222 elicited the highest cortisol release rates while benzocaine caused a bimodal response where the initial peak in cortisol release rate was followed by a second and smaller peak. <b>Metomidate</b> induced the lowest release of cortisol of the agents tested in both Atlantic halibut and Atlantic cod, but resulted in a bimodal response in Atlantic salmon where the initial increase in cortisol release was followed by an even larger increase. The stress induced in Atlantic salmon by isoeugenol resembled that of MS- 222, but did not reach the same elevated level. Over all the cortisol release was most profound in Atlantic salmon followed by Atlantic halibut and Atlantic cod. Based on the findings in the current study it is recommended that anaesthetic protocols should always be tested on a few fish under prevailing conditions in order to ensure an adequate level of depth while avoiding overdosing. This recommendation applies whether one single agent or a combination of agents are used although it was found here that protocols comprising combinations of agents provide wider margins of safety. While exposure to anaesthetic agents was found to elicit a stress response, displayed as increased levels of cortisol, the amount of cortisol released in response to anaesthesia was low compared to what is reported following strong stressors such as handling and confinement. Stress caused by anaesthetic agents may however represent an extra load during otherwise stressful circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Whole {{animal and}} in vitro {{experiments}} {{were used to}} compare and contrast the cardiovascular and, to a lesser extent, respiratory effects of three fish anaesthetics at approximately equipotent concentrations: 100 ppm MS 222, six to ten ppm <b>metomidate</b> and 60 ppm Aqui-S. Heart rate, cardiac output, dorsal aortic pressure, stroke volume, haematocrit, PaO 2 and plasma catecholamines were measured during five minutes of anaesthetic exposure with no other obvious stressors. Observed changes were due to both direct anaesthetic effects and secondary consequences of anaesthesia. Cardiovascular changes and heightened activity of Aqui-S treated fish suggests this anaesthetic causes a nociceptor mediated response. In vitro investigations of branchial haemodynamics, using isolated perfused gill preparations, vasoactivity of branchial arteries, using myography, changes in myocardial contractility of the ventricle, using in vitro paced ventricle strips, {{and changes in the}} ability of the stimulated vagus nerve to reduce heart rate, using a spontaneously beating in situ heart and nerve preparation, were performed to help explain the cardiovascular changes in the whole animals during anaesthetic induction. Using the results from these studies and information in the literature the responses of the whole animal were divided into four groups: primary effects were those caused directly by the anaesthetic, secondary effects were caused {{as a consequence of the}} primary effects, tertiary effects were due to a reaction to the presence of the anaesthetics and human effects were caused by handling or other manipulation offish. The cardiovascular effects of anaesthetic induction after handling were quite different from those during unstressed anaesthetic induction, and were mostly anaesthetic independent which suggested that the effects of handling were greater than the effects of anaesthetic exposure. Oxygen consumption during 24 hours recovery from anaesthesia showed there were no long term changes in respiration. Measurements of heart rate, cardiac output, dorsal aortic pressure and stroke volume during six hours recovery from five minutes exposure to the three anaesthetics showed recovery of these variables occurred within 30 minutes. However, Aqui-S treated fish showed an elevated stroke volume 30 minutes into the recovery. Measurements of heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume during recovery from anaesthesia and surgery suggested the cardiovascular effects were at least partially dependent on the anaesthetic used. However, the difference between the cardiovascular effects with and without surgery were far greater than any between anaesthetic effects...|$|E
40|$|Adrenal tumours, {{discovered}} en passant {{in patients}} undergoing radiological examinations for non-adrenal disease, so-called adrenal incidentalomas, have increased {{dramatically in the}} recent era of more sophisticated diagnostic modalities such as high resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, primary aldosteronism (PA) has been documented in several screening studies as being far more common than previously believed among hypertensive patients. In this thesis, a long-term follow-up cohort of patients who had undergone surgery for PA revealed {{that there was an}} excellent effect on blood-pressure, reduction of anti-hypertensive medication and hypokalaemia after surgery, even though the majority of these patients still required some anti-hypertensive medication. This was also true, in the higher than expected number of dominant nodular hyperplasia (nIHA) found in the study, but was slightly less pronounced than in aldosterone producing adenomas (APA).   Surgery was thus effective in lateralized PA. <b>Metomidate</b> positron emission tomography (MTO-PET) was explored in relation to histopathology in post-operative patients and found to be highly specific and sensitive in categorizing adrenocortical disease. Also, a higher standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio between tumours and normal adrenal cortex was found in hormonally hypersecreting adenomas as well as in adrenocortical cancer (ACC). The resolution limited the diagnosis of small tumours (< 1 - 1. 5 cm). MTO-PET was compared to standard radiological modalities (CT and MRI) in the diagnostic work-up of adrenal incidentalomas. All three modalities categorized and characterized the lesions well, with MTO-PET showing the highest sensitivity and specificity.   However this method is currently recommended to be used as complementary to the others in unclear cases, due to high costs and less availability. The resolution of MTO-PET was improved with respect to less noise and better delineation of small tumours when applying masked volume-wise principal component analysis (MVW-PCA), which will possibly enable future detection of small tumours in PA patients. Dexamethasone suppression treatment prior to MTO-PET examinations in PA patients decreased SUV in normal adrenal cortex but could not be shown to increase the SUV ratio between adenoma and normal cortex enabling better detection of small tumours, even though all the tumours were readily categorized in the study. Heterogenic SUV reactions to dexamethasone treatment indicate a need for further studies and refinement of the suppression method. In conclusion, long-term results of surgery for lateralized PA are good. MTO-PET is a highly sensitive and specific method for categorizing adrenocortical disease. Modulation of the method, e. g. by using MVW-PCA and refined dexamethasone suppression treatment, may improve the resolution of the method in delineating small tumours in PA, thus making MTO-PET a non-invasive and non-operator dependent future alternative to the currently recommended adrenal venous sampling (AVS) for lateralization diagnosis prior to surgery for PA...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of patterns {{of movement and}} space use by fishes {{to the understanding of}} population dynamics, community structure and spatial population models, is being increasingly recognised. Despite this realisation, information regarding patterns of movement is rare for fishes. Two important aspects in coral reef fisheries which are affected greatly by the lack of knowledge about movements, are the uncertainties associated with high fishing pressures on spawning aggregations, and the potential use of marine protected areas as a fisheries management strategy. The main aim of this research was to determine patterns of movement and space use of a species of major fishing importance (Plectropomus leopardus, Serranidae), in relation to annual spawning aggregation events, and with respect to existing marine protected area zoning. Given the known limitations of the conventional technique for assessments of movements, i. e. external mark-release-recapture techniques, an alternative methodology, ultrasonic telemetry, was adopted to address these aspects. The first objective consisted of methodological evaluations of ultrasonic telemetry for use on P. leopardus and in coral reef fish and fisheries research in general. The second objective was to estimate home ranges and basic temporal patterns of space use by the study species. The third objective was to locate previously unknown spawning aggregation sites, estimate their minimal catchment areas, and determine patterns of participation and residence of individual fish at aggregation sites. The fourth objective was a comparison of data obtained through telemetry with comparable data collected independently using a mark-release-resighting study, and to evaluate the data obtained through both methods in relation to the existing marine protected area zoning at the study location, with considerations to the use of marine protected areas as a fisheries management tool. Preliminary assessments of ultrasonic telemetry for use on P. leopardus included the evaluation of three ultrasonic transmitter placement methods (force feeding, external attachment, and surgical body cavity insertion) in conjunction with three different fish anaesthetics (<b>Metomidate,</b> Phenoxyethanol, and MS- 222). The most suitable method of transmitter placement for long-term application in P. leopardus was surgical implantation into the body cavity. Attaching transmitters externally led to severe aggravation of the attachment wounds due to repeated attempts by the fish to dislodge the transmitter. Force feeding transmitters was unsuitable due to the short gastric retention times observed (18 to 216 hours). Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222) was the anaesthetic chosen due to the ease of induction and maintenance of deep anaesthesia. Post-surgery recovery periods in aquaria avoided field losses due to injury-induced predation, and permitted examination of each specimen prior to release for proper closure and healing of incisions. The pilot evaluation of telemetry in the coral reef environment, and initial tracking trials indicated that manual ultrasonic tracking using visual triangulation should be conducted by taking bearings at approximately right angles (90 °) to each other, with approximate distances of 50 - 75 m between tracking vessel and estimated location of transmitter. Bearings taken at angles considerably less than 90 °, or taken at sharp angles to the prevailing wind, should be avoided. These considerations will result in minimal directional bias of bearings due to wind effects, while ensuring maximum accuracy and precision of position estimates. Observer training prior to tracking, and regular re-evaluation of bearing accuracy and precision during tracking sessions is recommended. Thirty-nine individual P. leopardus (fork length: mean = 49. 04 cm, range = 37. 6 to 67. 5 cm) were tracked successfully between 1993 and 1995. Eight of these were tracked during two subsequent field trips, resulting in 47 separate tracking sessions, comprising a total of 2, 024 fish-tracking days. Average minimum area polygon home ranges of P. leopardus differed between fish from fringing reefs (10, 458. 4 m² ± 962. 3 (SE)) and patch reefs (18, 796. 9 m² ± 3, 188. 8 (SE)). This difference was caused by differences in width of home ranges, with fringing reef home ranges being narrower than patch reef ones. Length of home ranges did not differ between reef types. Home ranges did not differ between male and female fish, and were stable within and between each tracking session (maximum 202 days between sessions). Plectropomus leopardus were day-active, predominantly using a small number of physical locations (3 - 4 positions) within their home ranges. Mean daily distance moved within home ranges was 192. 2 m ± 5. 09 (SE), with the maximum being 1121. 8 m. Patterns of space use were relatively consistent throughout the day. Position fidelity was very high at night, with very limited movements. A distinct pattern of home range use existed in relation to the prevalent current direction, with P. leopardus showing a strong preference for utilising positions located in the upcurrent portions of their home ranges. This study demonstrated, for the first time, distinct movements of P. leopardus in relation to changes in tidal currents. Thus, the observation commonly made by fishers of better catches on "run on" sides of reefs may be explained by the observed preference of upcurrent positions utilised by coral trout. Using ultrasonic telemetry, four major spawning aggregation sites of P. leopardus were detected at Lizard Island. Spawning aggregation activities displayed a lunar pattern, with peak activities during new moon periods in the southern-hemisphere spring-early summer period. Of 35 fish tracked during the spawning periods, only 31...|$|E
