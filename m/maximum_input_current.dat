Single layer LIGA microstructures with thickness of 200 m are fabri-cated on a dummy substrate first. They are then {{batch transfer}}red to an IC substrate by means of bonding via electroplating.

The electroplating and bonding process is conducted at 50 C with applied electroplating current density at 68. 3 AM 2 and it takes about 80 minutes to complete the bonding process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to analyze the input {{inductor}} design and to establish the relationship between the capacitance of the flying capacitor and the output voltage ripple {{in order to reduce the}} size and weight of the flying capacitor DC-DC boost converter (FCBC). The inductance of the input inductor is designed by considering the <b>maximum</b> <b>input</b> <b>current</b> ripple, and the experimental results are used to confirm that the input current ripple is within the designed value. Furthermore, according to the design specifications, the required inductance of an input inductor is approximately 25 % of that of a conventional two-level DC-DC boost converter, and the required inductor core volume is approximately 35 % of that of a conventional two-level DC-DC boost converter. Moreover, the capacitance of the flying capacitor and the output voltage ripple are confirmed to be independent of each other. Theoretically, this is because the time constant of the output capacitance and the output resistance of the FCBC is larger than the switching period of the switching frequency. This finding is confirmed by the simulation and experimental results of the present study. On the basis of this finding, the capacitance of the flying capacitor can be estimated and designed without considering the output voltage ripple. Moreover, the achieved maximum efficiency of the designed FCBC is 98. 5 % of the output power at 1 kW...|$|E

5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with <b>maximum</b> <b>input</b> <b>currents</b> at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|R

A technique for realizing dynami-cally biased log-domain filters while maintaining input-output linearity is presented.
