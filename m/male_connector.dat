There are 19 pins, with bandwidth to carry all SDTV, EDTV, HDTV, and 4K UHD modes. It is electrically compatible with single-link DVI-D.|$|E
25|$|XLR {{connectors}} {{are available}} in male and female versions in both cable and chassis mounting designs, {{a total of four}} styles. This is slightly unusual as many other connector designs omit one of the styles (typically a chassis mounting <b>male</b> <b>connector).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote also {{features}} an expansion port {{at the bottom}} which allows various functional attachments to be added. The connector, and any accessories that attach to it, use a 400kHz I²C protocol. This expandability {{is similar to that}} available with the port on the Nintendo 64 controller. A female connector is found on Wii remotes while expansions use a <b>male</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pigtails {{can have}} female or <b>male</b> <b>{{connectors}}.</b> Female connectors could be mounted {{in a patch}} panel, often in pairs although single-fiber solutions exist, {{to allow them to}} be connected to endpoints or other fiber runs with patch fibers. Alternatively they can have <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> and plug directly into an optical transceiver.|$|R

25|$|The SAE J1962 {{specification}} {{provides for}} two standardized hardware interfaces, called type A and type B. Both are female, 16-pin (2x8), D-shaped connectors, {{and both have}} a groove between the two rows of pins. But type B has the groove interrupted in the middle, so you can't plug a type A <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> into a type B socket. You can, however, mate a type B male plug in a type A female socket.|$|E
25|$|The AES42 standard, {{published}} by the Audio Engineering Society, defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or XLD <b>male</b> <b>connector,</b> rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate {{in accordance with the}} AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> as an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E

2500|$|Where XLR {{connectors}} {{are used}} for DC power, the genders are reversed {{with respect to their}} standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors [...] "follow the pin," [...] such that a <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> is an output and a female connector is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR connectors) the female connector is the output and the <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> is the input. This makes accidental contact with live parts less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.|$|E
2500|$|Most NEMA {{connectors}} {{are named}} following a simple alphanumeric code consisting of: a numeral preceding a hyphen, a numeral following the hyphen, and letters {{at the beginning}} and end of the code to indicate whether the connector is a locking type and whether it is a plug (<b>male</b> <b>connector)</b> or the corresponding receptacle [...] (female connector).|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{signal flow}} for audio in XLR connectors {{is that the}} output is a <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> and the input is female. In other words, the pins on the plug point {{in the direction of}} signal flow. This is the opposite of power connector standards which normally use female connectors for outputs, a convention influenced by the need to prevent accidental contact with dangerous voltages. However, the voltages of microphone and line level audio signals are not hazardous. The male XLR is usually [...] incorporated in the body of a microphone.|$|E

50|$|RS-232 devices may be {{classified}} as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> have DTE pin functions, and female connectors have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.|$|R

50|$|With the HD connectors, a cable {{normally}} has <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> while a SCSI device (e.g., host adapter, disk drive) has female. A {{female connector}} on a cable {{is meant to}} connect to another cable (for additional length or additional device connections).|$|R
50|$|The <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> are surface-mounted and {{soldered}} {{directly to}} the printed circuit board. They are designed to have a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. The mated connection is only 2.5 mm high and takes as little as 9 mm2 of board space.|$|R
