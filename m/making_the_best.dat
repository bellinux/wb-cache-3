5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> possible {{use of their}} forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> use of existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide {{are considered to be}} necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

25|$|Thomas {{produced}} {{a trio of}} albums for power pop group Badfinger on {{the tail end of}} their career, beginning with 1973's Ass, and 1974's Badfinger and Wish You Were Here albums. Ass was originally recorded with Badfinger producing, but the group later admitted they were incapable of producing themselves. Members Pete Ham and Tom Evans solicited Thomas' help in cleaning up existing recordings and laying down new tracks. Although the succeeding album Badfinger retained Thomas from the outset and was considered by critics to be an improvement in production, neither album was successful in the marketplace. For their third project together, Thomas held a meeting with the group and pleaded that they all concentrate on <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> record they could muster. It turned out that Wish You Were Here garnered the most positive critical response from periodicals, including Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{into account}} {{that this would be}} the band's first album on a major label, Killswitch Engage was adamant on <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> album that they could. This {{required}} Dutkiewicz to spend more time in the studio producing and writing songs as a whole, rather than just a collection of guitar riffs put together. D'Antonio stated the writing process for the record went very fast as he wrote the [...] "moshy, hardcore" [...] style riffs, Stroetzel wrote the thrash metal styled riffs, and Dutkiewicz wrote the [...] "catchy" [...] choruses. Leach said that his main goal when writing lyrics was to be used as an instrument to shine the light of God through his music.

[...] Tim Sendra of AllMusic felt that Wildflower [...] "falls short of expectations, but still ends up being a pretty good album anyway" [...] and considered the abundance of guest performers, {{with the exception of}} Jonathan Donahue, to be unnecessary, concluding that the group [...] "ended up <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> psychedelic Chemical Brothers album ever instead of making another classic Avalanches album." [...] Emily MacKay of NME was less favourable, asking how [...] "something that took so long [...] sound so, well, meh," [...] and ultimately called the album [...] "a faded snapshot of a cosier, very distant-seeming past." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the onset}} of the American Revolution, McDonald was an ardent Whig.

Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused the appointment for either of two reasons: he would have been second-in-command to a colonel lacking prior military experience and McDonald had previously {{been a member of the}} vestry of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over [...] "a matter of business with the church". General Adam Stephen, a fellow Scotsman, wrote a letter to McDonald dated March 15, 1777, in which he implored him to accept Washington's appointment, stating [...] "Your appointment comes entirely from your own merit." [...] Stephen warned McDonald not to let his [...] "Highland pride" [...] dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington's offer, Stephen wrote: [...] "Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> excuse you can." ...|$|E
500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E
