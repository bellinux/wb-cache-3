40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{different}} time frames through which 25 {{adults who have}} used non-suicidal self-hurting throughout their lives evaluate their experiences. Participants in the study on which {{this article is based}} were drawn from a non-clinical population recruited mainly through dedicated websites. All were interviewed in 2008 in South London. The participants all used time frames to structure their narratives about their use of self-hurting. Short time frames placed around the act of self-hurting itself let them focus on the immediate effects, including pleasure. Longer time frames enabled them to reflect on the causes of self-hurting, as a way of managing emotions and difficult social situations, and introduced consideration of the risks involved, such as escalation in use and fear of discovery. Looking back through a longer time frame, participants recognised how their use of self-hurting changed over time with some ceasing to use it and others using it less frequently. Reflecting on the use of self-hurting across their life span, some participants expressed regrets, but the majority described it as an important way of coping with intense feelings and intolerable situations, which could be seen as reasonable under the circumstances. Participant’s selection and use of time frames, whether short-, <b>medium-</b> <b>or</b> <b>long-term,</b> orientated towards the past, the present or the future had an important impact on how they assessed the balance between the risks and benefits of this behaviour and the shifting compromises that they made between them.

Migration of the femoral component was measured by RSA at intervals of three, six, 12 and 24 months. At 24 months the total three-dimensional migration of the head was 0. 2 mm.

Patients and Methods: Fasting serum CgA and gastrin were determined in newly diagnosed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients (n = 54) treated with diverse doses of PPI during a 28 -day period, in patients treated with PPIs for at least 6 months (n = 42), and in subjects where PPI treatment could be stopped (n = 11). Results: A significant stepwise increase of CgA levels was observed after 5 days during the 28 -day period treatment with all PPI doses. Gastrin increased significantly also in the standard and high-dose PPI subgroups. The most prominent increase of CgA was observed in the high-dose PPI subgroup.

However, comparative methods tend to overlook cultural dynamics - the formation, maintenance, and transformation of cultures over time. The present article gives {{a brief overview of}} four different types of research designs that have been used to examine cultural dynamics in the literature: (1) cross-temporal methods that trace medium- to long-term changes in a culture; (2) cross-generational methods that explore medium-term implications of cultural transmission; (3) experimental simulation methods that investigate micro-level mechanisms of cultural dynamics; and (4) formal models and computer simulation methods often used to investigate long-term and macro-level implications of micro-level mechanisms. These methods differ in terms of level of analysis for which they are designed (micro vs. macro-level), scale of time for which they are typically used (short-, <b>medium-,</b> <b>or</b> <b>long-term),</b> and direction of inference (deductive vs. empirical method) that they imply.

Method: A three-round Delphi survey design {{was used to}} identify midwifery research topics. Issues identified through content analysis formed Questionnaires 2 and 3.

A final discussion group set short-, <b>medium-</b> <b>or</b> <b>long-term</b> timeframes for the research topics. Participants: 334 midwives were recruited from a national invitation to all midwives. Response rates were 43 % (Round 1; 142 / 334), 85 % (Round 2; 121 / 142) and 81 % (Round 3; 98 / 121).

40|$|AIM: In {{the years}} 1990 - 1993, {{in an effort}} to reduce waiting-list time, a small number of {{patients}} were sent from Exeter to hospitals in London to undergo elective total hip replacement. No <b>medium-</b> <b>or</b> <b>long-term</b> follow-up was arranged. Our aim was to audit the outcome of these hip replacements. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Review of the records of the referring medical practices, Regional Health Authority, local orthopaedic hospital and the distant centres at which the surgery was performed identified 31 cases. A total of 27 hip replacements in 24 patients were available for clinical and radiological review. RESULTS: 12 (44 %) hips have so far required revision surgery, at a mean of 6. 5 years. Of these, three (11 %) have been for deep infection. A further three hips (11 %) are radiologically loose and are being closely monitored. Two patients (7 %) suffered permanent sciatic nerve palsy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients whose surgery was performed locally over a similar time period have a published failure rate of only 4. 9 %. This difference is highly statistically significant (P < 0. 001). The causes for such a difference in outcome were analysed and include surgical technique, implant selection and absence of follow-up. In the light of this evidence, we would like to urge the government to address waiting list problems by investing in the local infrastructure.

Our objective here was to evaluate medium-term outcomes in case-series of patients who underwent Mosaicplasty® for OLT repair. HypothesisMosaicplasty® provides good medium-term outcomes with low morbidity when used for OLT repair. Patients et methodsWe retrospectively reviewed cases of Mosaicplasty® for OLT repair, performed in combination with malleolar osteotomy {{on the side of}} the OLT, at either of two centres, between 1997 and 2013. Pre-operative clinical data were collected from the medical records and all patients were re-evaluated. We studied 37 patients with a mean age of 33 years. ResultsMean follow-up at re-evaluation was 76 months. Mean AOFAS score at re-evaluation was 83 (range, 9 – 100). A work-related cause to the OLT was associated with significantly poorer outcomes (P= 0. 01). AOFAS values were significantly better in patients whose OLT size was 0. 5 to 1 cm 2. The Ogilvie-Harris score at last follow-up was good or excellent in 78 % of patients. No patient experienced morbidity related to the malleolar osteotomy. Persistent patellar syndrome was noted in 6 patients. DiscussionIn our case-series, Mosaicplasty® for OLT repair provided good medium-term outcomes in 78 % of patients. Nevertheless, the donor-site morbidity should be borne in mind. Mosaicplasty® deserves to be viewed as a reference standard method for OLT repair. Level of evidenceIV, retrospective study...|$|R
