The battalion learned {{that it would be}} deployed {{along with the rest of}} the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States), as an element of the 1st Cavalry Division (United States). At this time the 1st Battalion adopted the nickname [...] "Aleutian" [...] as the unit's fixed call sign. The unit underwent training at Fort Hood, Texas for three months of intensive training in Force Protection, Convoy Security, Route Clearance and Urban Operations. The 1–206th FA became the first Army unit to field and conduct artillery live fire exercises with the new ANGYK-57 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). Each battery conducted two days of artillery live fire training during post mobilization training. At this time the 1–206th FA received the attachment of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard. The 1–206th FA had arrived at mobilization station approximately 80 soldiers short of its required strength, most vacancies being in the Fire Support Teams. The National Guard Bureau supplied this shortage by activating A/1-103rd and attaching it to 1–206th for deployment. A/1-103rd FA quickly became known as the [...] "Rhody" [...] Battery. While the 1–206th was at Fort Hood, the battalion commander, battalion operations officer, and three battery commanders accompanied the brigade staff and other battalion commanders and staff on a Pre-Deployment Site Survey (PDSS) to Iraq. The commanders spent 10 days traveling to the Baghdad Area of Operations, being hosted by the 16th Engineer Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. In late January 2004 the 1–206th FA moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise to validate the brigade training for the deployment. While at Fort Polk the 39th Brigade staff was informed by the 1st Cavalry Division that due to a scheduling gap and the need to assume responsibility of the base defense operations center at Camp Taji, Iraq, the brigade would have to deploy one battalion approximately three weeks ahead of the rest of the brigade. The 39th Brigade selected the 1–206th to assume this mission and the battalion was prioritized on the brigade's <b>movement</b> <b>plan.</b> The advance party of the 1–206th FA departed Fort Polk on 28 February 2004. Due to a mechanical breakdown en route the advanced party arrived in Kuwait on 8 March 2004.

Another excellent officer on the army staff was the chief of artillery, Major General Henry J. Hunt. Recognized as one of the war’s foremost experts on artillery, Hunt had {{a more active role in}} operational matters than most artillery chiefs who usually just performed administrative duties. The rest of Meade’s staff was of mixed quality. In addition, the poor caliber of Union maps coupled with some mediocre young officers who were used as guides repeatedly led to misdirected movements and lost time.Compared to Meade’s large headquarters, Lee maintained a smaller group of trusted subordinates for his staff. Lee did not have a chief of staff, thus much of the responsibility for writing his orders fell on the shoulders of a few personal aides and secretaries, especially Lieutenant Colonel Charles Marshall. Lee employed several young officers, such as Lieutenant Colonel Walter Taylor and Colonel Charles S. Venable, as aides, and had great faith in these men to transmit his orders to subordinates. However, the lack of a true staff to ease his workload probably took its toll on Lee who was ill and physically exhausted by the time of the North Anna battles at the end of May. Other than his young aides, Lee had several other staff officers of mixed quality. His chief of artillery, Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, was mediocre at best, and the Army commander usually relegated his chief of artillery to strictly administrative duties. On the other hand, Major General Martin Luther (M.L.)

Failing to select, prepare or perform correct prehension movements results in dramatic limitations for the affected individual. Whereas we begin {{to have a better}} understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the execution of object-directed movements, less is known about how exactly our brain makes the plan for action. Previous studies examining <b>movement</b> <b>planning</b> suggested that neuronal populations in parieto-frontal areas contain information about upcoming movements moments before they actually take place. However, such studies typically used experiments in which the participant was instructed about the <b>movement</b> to <b>plan</b> with visual or auditory cues, making it difficult to disentangle <b>movement</b> <b>planning</b> from the processing of cues and stimulus- response (S-R) mapping. In our first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Study I), we compared an instructed condition with a free-choice condition that allowed participants to select which prehension movement to perform: a condition in which the task was not tied to specific external cues (i. e., no direct S-R mapping). Using multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA), we found contralateral parietal and frontal regions containing abstract representations of <b>planned</b> <b>movements</b> that generalize across the way these movements were generated (internally vs externally). The majority of previous studies were based on delayed-movement tasks, which introduce brain responses unrelated to movement preparation. Consequently, whether these findings would generalize to immediate movements remained unclear.

Using time-resolved MVPA allowed us to reveal shared representations for delayed and non-delayed <b>movement</b> <b>planning</b> in human primary motor cortex and examine how movement representations unfolded throughout the different stages of planning and execution.

The acoustic startle reflex provides a means to initiate a motor plan involuntarily. In {{the presence of a}} <b>movement</b> <b>plan,</b> startling acoustic stimulus triggers non-voluntary early execution of planned movement, a phenomenon known as the startReact response. In unimpaired individuals, the startReact response is identical to a voluntarily initiated movement, except that it is elicited 30 – 40 ms.

We found that startReact responses were intact following stroke. Responses were initiated as rapidly as those in unimpaired subjects, and with muscle coordination patterns resembling those seen during unimpaired volitional movements. Results were striking for elbow flexion movements, which demonstrated no significant differences between the startReact responses elicited in our stroke and unimpaired subject groups. The results during planned extension movements were less straightforward for stroke subjects, since the startReact response exhibited task inappropriate activity in the flexors.

40|$|Existing {{theories}} of <b>movement</b> <b>planning</b> {{suggest that it}} takes time to select and prepare the actions required to achieve a given goal.

These interme-diate movements are generally interpreted as errors of <b>movement</b> <b>planning,</b> arising either from planning being incomplete or from parallel <b>movement</b> <b>plans</b> interfering with one anoth-er. Here we present an alternative view: that intermediate movements reflect uncertainty about movement goals. We show how intermediate movements are predicted by an optimal feedback control model that incorporates an ongoing decision about movement goals. According to this view, intermediate movements reflect an exploitation of compatibility be-tween goals. Consequently, reducing the compatibility between goals should reduce the incidence of intermediate movements.
