25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during <b>my</b> <b>two</b> days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt {{as one of}} the worst guest stars in Friends: [...] "Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the {{audience}} did, too." [...] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was [...] "definitely [...] going against type" [...] and LeBlanc called him [...] "really great on the show". USA Today rates Will's line [...] "Look at her standing there with those yams. <b>My</b> <b>two</b> greatest enemies, Ross.
