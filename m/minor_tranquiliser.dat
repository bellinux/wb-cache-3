40|$|Prevalence of {{generalised}} anxiety disorders is widespread in Great Britain. Previous small-scale {{research has shown}} variations in <b>minor</b> <b>tranquiliser</b> prescribing, identifying several potential predictors of prescribing volume. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between general practice <b>minor</b> <b>tranquiliser</b> prescribing rates and practice population and general practice characteristics for all general practices in England. Methods: Multiple regression analysis of <b>minor</b> <b>tranquiliser</b> prescribing volumes during 2004 / 2005 for 8, 291 English general practices with general practice and population variables obtained from the General Medical Services (GMS) statistics, Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), 2001 Census and 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Results: The highest rates of <b>minor</b> <b>tranquiliser</b> prescribing were in areas with the greatest local deprivation while general practices situated in areas with larger proportions of residents of black ethnic origin had lower rates of prescribing. Other predictors of increased prescribing were general practices with older general practitioners and general practices with older registered practice populations. Conclusion: Our findings {{show that there is}} wide variation of minor tranquilisers prescribing across England which has implications regarding access to treatment and inequity of service provision. Future research should determine the barriers to equitable prescribing amongst general practices serving larger populations of black ethnic origin...|$|E

40|$|During a {{prospective}} {{study of the}} whole spectrum of drug-related problems treated in one month by 62 casualty departments in the Greater London area, 949 cases of deliberate self-poisoning were identified. Nearly three-quarters of the patients were {{under the age of}} 40 years and in all age groups women outnumbered men. Psychoactive drugs of some sort were used in 673 incidents (71 %) and ordinary analgesics and other drugs were used in 252 (27 %). The incidence of polydrug overdose (423; 45 %) was much higher than that found in other studies. In at least 256 incidents (27 %) there was a history of repeated overdose in the previous 12 months. Comparison with other studies showed a steady decline in the use of barbiturates in deliberate self-poisoning but an increase in the use of non-barbiturate hypnotics, <b>minor</b> <b>tranquilisers,</b> and antidepressants...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hospital-treated {{deliberate}} self-poisoning (DSP) {{is common}} and the existing national monitoring systems are often deficient. Clinical Practice Guidelines (UK and Australia) recommend universal psychosocial assessment within the general hospital as standard care. We compared presentation rates, patient characteristics, psychosocial assessment and aftercare in UK and Australia. Methods: We used a cross sectional design, for a ten year study of all DSP presentations identified through sentinel units in Oxford, UK (n. = 3042) and Newcastle, Australia (n. = 3492). Results: Oxford had higher presentation rates for females (standardised rate ratio 2. 4 : CI 99 % 1. 9, 3. 2) and males (SRR 2. 5 : CI 99 % 1. 7, 3. 5). Female to male ratio was 1. 6 : 1, 70 % presented after-hours, 95 % were {{admitted to a}} general hospital and co-ingestion of alcohol occurred in a substantial minority (Oxford 24 %, Newcastle 32 %). Paracetamol, <b>minor</b> <b>tranquilisers</b> and antidepressants were the commonest drug groups ingested, although the overall pattern differed. Psychosocial assessment rates were high (Oxford 80 %, Newcastle 93 %). Discharge referral for psychiatric inpatient admission (Oxford 8 %, Newcastle 28 %), discharge to home (Oxford 80 %, Newcastle 70 %) and absconding (Oxford 11 %, Newcastle 2 %) differed between the two units. Conclusions: Oxford has higher age-standardised rates of DSP than Newcastle, although many other characteristics of patients are similar. Services can provide {{a high level of}} assessment as recommended in clinical guidelines. There is some variation in after-care. Sentinel service monitoring routine care of DSP patients can provide valuable comparisons between countries...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive-behavioural therapies {{have shown}} to be {{generally}} effective in treating anxious young people. Yet there is considerable room for improvement, as many clients do not achieve complete remission. This article examines the potential use of D-cycloserine (DCS) to augment exposure-based therapies for anxious young people. DCS is a "cognitive-enhancing" medication believed to consolidate fear-extinction learning into memory. This consolidation may "immunise" against the return of their fear and speed remission. This article describes what DCS is {{and how it is}} believed to work. It describes the "translational research" in animals that led to its development for consolidating fear extinction. It reviews the current state of evidence for DCS augmentation and examines the applicability of DCS to enhance psychological treatments for paediatric anxiety disorders. Studies currently under way at Macquarie University and Griffith University in Australia are reviewed. Future directions for this promising research area are briefly considered. A promising development in the treatment of anxiety disorders is the use of "cognitive-enhancing" medications like D-cycloserine (DCS) to improve conventional psychological therapies. Exposure therapies relying upon the principles of "fear extinction" are a cornerstone in the treatment of anxiety: people suffering anxiety are encouraged to gradually "face their fears" in order to overcome them. These principles have {{shown to be}} generally effective in treating many forms of anxiety; however, there is considerable room for improvement, as many clients do not achieve complete remission or prematurely drop out of therapy. Cognitive enhancers like DCS may represent a safe and effective means for clients to consolidate treatment gains and speed their recovery. Young people suffering anxiety would arguably be the greatest beneficiaries of a more effective treatment model, as there are considerable benefits associated with early intervention (e. g., Rapee, Kennedy, Ingram, Edwards, & Sweeney, 2005). With this consideration in mind, groups of Australian researchers are currently investigating the use of DCS to improve treatment outcomes in clinically anxious children and adolescents. Skills-based cognitive-behavioural interventions for anxious children {{have been shown to be}} generally effective, with 55 - 60 % of children becoming diagnosis-free post-treatment (James, Soler, & Weatherall, 2006; Rapee, Schniering, & Hudson, 2009). Yet few treated children report symptoms as low as non-clinical populations and around 40 % remain diagnosable after treatment (e. g., Rapee et al., 2009). An intuitive means to improve treatment outcomes in this population is to combine psychotherapy with medications known to reduce anxiety symptoms (for example, using antidepressants or <b>minor</b> <b>tranquilisers).</b> Yet pharmacological augmentation of psychological treatments for anxiety have shown generally disappointing results (see Otto, Smits, & Reese, 2005 for review). Furthermore, the use of psychotropic medications in a young population is not without risk, and parents may be unwilling to expose their children to these medications over prolonged periods. Targeted use of DCS may represent a safe and effective treatment alternative to consolidate treatment gains made during exposure therapy. No Full Tex...|$|R
