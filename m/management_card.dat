2500|$|The 747-400ER {{included}} {{the option of}} one or two additional [...] body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System <b>Management</b> <b>Card</b> (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER include relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of identification cards at the University of Economics, Prague. Its {{primary goal is}} to consider and evaluate {{the possibility of a}} transfer of the ID <b>card</b> <b>management</b> into the ISIS system. The thesis consists of four parts. The first one offers a complex analysis of the ID <b>card</b> <b>management</b> at the University. The second one analyses two ID <b>card</b> <b>management</b> systems: the NESA system, which is being used at the University now, and the ISIS system, which could also be used for the ID <b>card</b> <b>management.</b> The third part includes a proposal of adjustments in the ISIS system, which would make its ID <b>card</b> <b>management</b> implementation comply with the University's needs. The proposal describes general features of the system, relations to its environs and a graphical user interface. Finally the last part covers the actual state of the project and its differences from the proposal offered in the thesis. Information sources for the thesis were legal norms, University regulations and internal documents as well as the author's knowledge and experience gained through several years of the NESA system maintenance and numerous consultations with the University ID <b>card</b> <b>management</b> staff and ISIS developers.

50|$|A {{complete}} {{remote management}} system allows remote reboot, shutdown, powering on; hardware sensor monitoring (fan speed, power voltages, chassis intrusion, etc.); broadcasting of video output to remote terminals and receiving of input from remote keyboard and mouse (KVM over IP). It also can access local media like a DVD drive, or disk images, from the remote machine. If necessary, this {{allows one to}} perform remote installation of the operating system. Remote management {{can be used to}} adjust BIOS settings that may not be accessible after the operating system has already booted. Settings of hardware RAID or RAM clocking can also be adjusted as the <b>management</b> <b>card</b> needs no hard drives or main memory to operate.|$|E
50|$|OPMA {{was created}} as a joint {{technology}} development effort between AMD and various platform management subsystem technology companies such as Agilent, AMI, Avocent, and Raritan Embedded Solutions (formerly called Peppercon). When OPMA was first released in February 2005, platform hardware management was being treated as a value added feature by OEMs. This resulted in a constant redesign of the <b>management</b> <b>card</b> infrastructure such that no two motherboard manufacturers could use the same card. Lack of standards and constant redesign resulted in higher end user costs. While PCI based management cards were available which could be plugged {{into a variety of}} platforms, the PCI bus did not provide direct access to all of the sensors needed to manage the hardware aspects of a platform. To gain full sensor access, custom headers had to be added to motherboards. Custom cables then linked these sideband signals between the card and the motherboard. PCI based platform management cards also consume a PCI slot which is a premium resource for many servers. This is especially true of those using the 1U rack format and those which need PCI slots for RAID interface cards that enhance system hard disk throughput.|$|E
50|$|The 747-400ER (Extended Range) was {{launched}} on November 28, 2000 following an order by Qantas for six aircraft. The model was {{commonly referred to}} as the '910k' signifying its maximum weight achieved via structural modifications and modified landing gear. This was the only order for the passenger version, chosen by Qantas to allow for full loads between Melbourne and Los Angeles, particularly in the western direction. The −400ER can fly 500 miles (805 km) farther, or carry 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) more freight. The first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER. Qantas received the first delivery of a 747−400ER Registration VH-OEF on October 31, 2002; this was the second airplane built. The flight test airplane was refurbished and delivered in Qantas livery. The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional 3240 gal body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks.

5000|$|Released in 2012, PE M420 is a [...] "quarter-size" [...] blade: {{where most}} servers are 'half-size', {{allowing}} 16 blades per M1000e enclosure, {{with the new}} M420 up to 32 blade servers can be installed in a single chassis. Implementing the M420 has some consequences for the system: many people have reserved 16 IP addresses per chassis to support the [...] "automatic IP address assignment" [...] for the iDRAC <b>management</b> <b>card</b> in a blade, but {{as it is now}} possible to run 32 blades per chassis people might need to change their management IP assignment for the iDRAC. To support the M420 server one needs to run CMC firmware 4.1 or later and one needs a full-size [...] "sleeve" [...] that holds up to four M420 blades. It also has consequences for the [...] "normal" [...] I/O NIC assignment: most (half-size) blades have two LOMs (LAN On Motherboard): one connecting to the switch in the A1 fabric, the other to the A2 fabric. And the same applies to the Mezzanine cards B and C. All available I/O modules (except for the PCM6348, MXL an MIOA) have 16 internal ports: one for each half-size blade. As an M420 has two 10 Gb LOM NICs, a fully loaded chassis would require 2 × 32 internal switch ports for LOM and the same for Mezzanine. An M420 server only supports a single Mezzanine card (Mezzanine B) whereas all half-height and full-height systems support two Mezzanine cards.To support all on-board NICs one would need to deploy a 32-slot Ethernet switch such as the MXL or Force10 I/O Aggregator. But for the Mezzanine card it is different: the connections from Mezzanine B on the PE M420 are [...] "load-balanced" [...] between the B and C-fabric of the M1000e: the Mezzanine card in [...] "slot A" [...] (top slot in the sleeve) connects to Fabric C while [...] "slot B" [...] (the second slot from the top) connects to fabric B, and that is then repeated for C and D slots in the sleeve.|$|E
