40|$|Real-time {{erosion of}} aft dome {{internal}} insulation {{was measured with}} internal instrumentation on a static test of a lengthened version of the Space Shuffle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM). This effort {{marks the first time}} that real-time aft dome insulation erosion (Le., erosion due to the combined effects of thermochemical ablation and mechanical abrasion) was measured in this kind of large motor static test [designated as Engineering Test Motor number 3 (ETM 3) I. This paper presents data plots of the erosion depth versus time. The data indicates general erosion versus time behavior that is in contrast to what would be expected from earlier analyses. Engineers have long known that the thermal environment in the aft dome is severe and that the resulting aft dome insulation erosion is significant. Models of aft dome erosion involve a two-step process of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and material ablation modeling. This modeling effort is complex. The time- dependent effects are difficult to verify with only prefire and postfire insulation <b>measurements.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> vectoring, slag accumulation, and changing boundary conditions will affect the time dependence of aft dome erosion. Further study of this data and continued measurements on future motors will increase our understanding of the aft dome flow and erosion environment...|$|R

The nozzle was also tested as a truncated nozzle, at an expansion area ratio of 428. Thrust coefficient and thrust coefficient efficiency values are presented for each configuration at various propellant mixture ratios (oxygen/fuel).

Based on the above strategy, the effect of cavitation phenomenon on spray formation at the typical diesel engine condition was further evaluated. The final numerical results mainly clarified that the contribution of cavitation phenomena to primary breakup is quite appreciable, and subsequently {{the evolution of the}} high-pressure and evaporating diesel spray structure greatly changes as cavitation occurs inside fuel injection nozzles. Moreover, evaluating the effects of cavitation phenomena on realistic diesel spray cannot be only confined to primary breakup or near-nozzle field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} work {{has shown that}} measured resistojet thrust decreases from that obtained at hard vacuum conditions as the test-cell pressure rises above 0. 001 torr. Thrust losses have been observed for both cold and heated flow conditions, and the most significant losses have been experienced using thrusters with low Reynolds number flow and high area ratio nozzles. In order to further investigate nozzle flow characteristics, a pressure probe having four degrees of freedom {{has been used to}} obtain stagnation pressure surveys across the nozzle exit planes of four resistojets. The surveys show a change in the ratio of the supersonic core to the viscous boundary layer flow areas as the test-cell pressure increases. The surveys are also used for detecting whether an oblique shock is present in an overexpanded nozzle flow. Thruster temperature <b>measurements</b> and <b>nozzle</b> exit plane pressure surveys indicate that thrust losses are the combined result of convection heat losses and nozzle flow momentum effects...|$|R

Three different nozzle cross-sections, viz. circular, square, and rectangular, each with an equivalent diameter of around 20 mm are used during this study. Reynolds number based on hydraulic diameter (d) is varied between 5000 and 15000 and jet-to-plate spacing from 0. 5 to 12 nozzle diameters. Length-to-equivalent diameter ratio (l/de) of 50 is chosen for each nozzle configuration. The local heat transfer characteristics are estimated using thermal images obtained by infrared thermal imaging technique. Local and average Nusselt number on the impinged surface are presented for all the nozzle configurations investigated.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the last eleven years, the concept of thrust {{vectoring}} has emerged as a promising method of enhancing aircraft control capabilities in post-stall flight incursions during combat. In order to study the application of simultaneous pitch and yaw vectoring to single expansion ramp nozzles, a static test was conducted in the NASA-Langley 16 foot transonic tunnel. This investigation was based on internal performance data provided by force, mass flow and internal pressure <b>measurements</b> at <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratios up to 8. The internal performance characteristics of the nozzle were studied for several combinations of six different parameters: yaw vectoring angle, pitch vectoring angle, upper ramp cutout, sidewall hinge location, hinge inclination angle and sidewall containment. Results indicated a 2 -to- 3 -percent decrease in resultant thrust ratio with vectoring in either pitch or yaw. Losses were mostly associated with the turning of supersonic flow. Resultant thrust ratios were also decreased by sideways expansion of the jet. The effects of cutback corners in the upper ramp and lower flap on performance were small. Maximum resultant yaw vector angles, about half of the flap angle, were achieved for the configuration with the most forward hinge location...|$|R

40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{theoretical}} predictions of fluid properties and experimental heat transfer and thrust measurements, the zones of laminar, transitional, and turbulent boundary layer flow were defined for the NASA Lewis 1030 : 1 area ratio rocket nozzle. Tests were performed on the nozzle at chamber pressures from 350 to 100 psia. For these conditions, the throat diameter Reynolds numbers varied from 300, 000 to 1 million. The propellants used were gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen. Thrust <b>measurements</b> and <b>nozzle</b> outer wall temperature measurements were taken during the 3 -sec test runs. Comparison of experimental heat transfer and thrust data with the corresponding predictions from the Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle analysis program indicated laminar flow in the nozzle at a throat diameter Reynolds number of 320, 000 or chamber pressure of 360 psia. Comparison of experimental and predicted heat transfer data indicated transitional flow {{up to and including}} a chamber pressure of 1000 psia. Predicted values of the axisymmetric acceleration parameter within the convergent and divergent nozzle were consistent with the above results. Based upon an extrapolation of the heat transfer data and predicted distributions of the axisymmetric acceleration parameter, transitional flow was predicted up to a throat diameter Reynolds number of 220, 000 or 2600 -psia chamber pressure.

40|$|Spray drift is a {{consideration}} for growers and applicators who are increasingly selecting larger droplet producing nozzles to allay their concerns. As new technologies {{arrive on the}} market, the prices of individual nozzles have risen which puts a greater need for consistency among nozzles to be worth the investment. These nozzles, while effective at reducing spray drift, {{may not always be}} consistent at maintaining efficacy which can be a result of a lack of uniformity in the production of these nozzles. Twenty-one spray drift reducing nozzles were compared for droplet size distributions across three liquids of varying dynamic surface tensions in a wind tunnel at the University of Queensland. Research sought to identify the repeatability of each nozzle type by randomly selecting five units to test consistency of droplet size <b>measurements</b> across <b>nozzle</b> type. Results indicate that some nozzle types are consistent and repeatable while others are not. It was also observed that some nozzle types are relatively unaffected by liquid type, where others resulted in a droplet size change in volume median diameter (VMD) of 100 μm depending on liquid type at the same operating pressure.
