5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife <b>metasedimentary</b> and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|On the {{southwest}} of the Yilgarn Craton the Balingup Gneiss Complex is situated inboard from the Early Proterozoic Leeuwin Complex of metamorphic rocks. The Balingup Complex consists primarily of <b>metasedimentary</b> paragneiss, granite orthogneiss, with minor layers of calc-silicate, ultramafic and ortho-amphibolite gneiss. The metamorphic grade {{is considered to be}} peak granulite facies, but the majority has preserved peak amphibolite facies assemblages.|$|E
25|$|The Sacred Heart {{granitic}} {{bodies that}} occur along {{portions of the}} Minnesota River Valley are relatively unfractured and unfoliated, and may represent passive intrusions into folded <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks. It is a typical late-tectonic medium-grained pink granite that was intruded around , after the suturing of the MRV gneissic terrane onto the Superior province. Similar intrusions farther east along the GLTZ show later dates, reinforcing the theorized closure from west to east.|$|E
25|$|Massive sulfides are {{not always}} present but where present are {{composed}} of >90% Fe-Ni-Cu sulfides occasionally with exotic enclaves of olivine, <b>metasedimentary</b> or melted material derived from the footwall to the lava flow. The massive sulfide normally sits upon a footwall of basalt or felsic volcanic rock, into which the massive sulfide may locally intrude, forming veins, interpillow sulfides, and interbreccia sulfides. Semi-massive sulfides are more common and are composed of 75-90% Fe-Ni-Cu sulfides with inclusions of olivine and wall rocks.|$|E
25|$|The Western Gneiss Terrane {{is exposed}} {{along the western}} half of the {{northern}} margin of the Yilgarn Craton as the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, a composite of heavily polydeformed feldspathic metagranite and <b>metasedimentary</b> amphibolite-grade gneisses and migmatites, dated at greater than 3.3 Ga and up to 3.8 Ga in age, flanked by the Murgoo Gneiss Terrane (2.95 Ga), as well as sheets of 2.75 Ga to 2.6 Ga granite, obducted ophiolite sheets (the Trillbar Complex) and some 2.4 Ga to 2.0 Ga Proterozoic gneiss belts.|$|E
25|$|Located in the Tijuca Range, Pedra da Gávea is 842m (2,762ft) tall, and is {{a granite}} dome. The flat top of the {{mountain}} is capped with a 150m tall layer of granite, whereas underneath, the mound is made up of gneiss. The former dates to around 450 million years ago, whereas the latter dates to 600 million years. The mountain, much like other stone outcroppings in and around the area, is the result of younger Neoproterozoic granitoid rocks and thin Cretaceous diabase dikes intruding the older Meso-Neoproterozoic high-grade <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks.|$|E
25|$|Below 7,000m (23,000ft), the Rongbuk Formation {{underlies}} the North Col Formation and forms {{the base of}} Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1cm to 1,500m (0.4in to 4,900ft). These leucogranites {{are part of a}} belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.|$|E
25|$|The archean rocks {{members of}} Belo Horizonte complex and supracrustal {{sequences}} of the Paleoproterozoic is predominant.

The <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks has its area of occurrence on the south of Ribeirão Arrudas pipeline, constituting about 30% of the area of Belo Horizonte. The characteristics of this area are lithological diversities and rugged topography, which has its maximum expression in the Serra do Curral (Corral Ridge), the southern boundary of the municipality.|$|E
25|$|The last {{universal}} {{common ancestor}} (LUCA) {{is the most}} recent organism from which all organisms now living on Earth descend. Thus {{it is the most}} recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (sometime in the Paleoarchean era). The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Although more than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are estimated to be extinct, there are currently 10–14 million species of life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{sources of the}} CO2 are {{degassing}} of intruded magma and gas release from limestone-rich <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the CO2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along faults to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support {{the theory that the}} gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole. There is evidence that the rate of CO2 discharge has been declining, with emissions peaking in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The first {{sequence}} {{in the order}} is the Scoullar Mountain formation. The layer is characterized by sedimentary breccia and interbedded andesitic lava. In addition felsic pyroclastic rocks are very common in places and one sandstone-conglomerate lava flow can be found. The sedimentary breccia is dominated by pebbletoboulder size angular <b>metasedimentary</b> stratas, and a few crystal tuff layers that contain about 1% biotite, the only such high amount of a typically trace mineral outside of Rothea formation in the Extracaldera sequence. A pumice-ridden lapilli-tuff section near the believed top section additionally has a 1% composition of the mineral amphibole. The exposed portion of the flows loosely flank {{the slopes of the}} volcano on the left and right, and are represented by bright orange on the map.|$|E
25|$|Common ancestry between organisms of {{different}} species arises during speciation, in which new species are established {{from a single}} ancestral population. Organisms which share a more recent common ancestor are more closely related. The most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms is the last universal ancestor, which lived about 3.9 billion years ago. The two earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks discovered in western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. All currently living organisms on Earth share a common genetic heritage (universal common descent), with each being the descendant from a single original species, though the suggestion of substantial horizontal gene transfer during early evolution has led to questions about monophyly of life.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Range is {{the range}} of tall, biodiverse hills across the {{northern}} portion of Trinidad and is considered {{an extension of the}} Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, {{making it one of the}} most biodiverse mountain ranges in the Caribbean. The Northern Range runs from the Chaguaramas Peninsula in the west to Toco in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city climbs into the hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche which top 900 m (3,000ft).|$|E
25|$|The Animikie Group is a {{geologic}} group {{composed of}} sedimentary and <b>metasedimentary</b> rock, having been originally deposited between 2,500 and 1,800 {{million years ago}} within the Animikie Basin. This group of formations is geographically divided into the Gunflint Range, the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, and the Cuyuna Range. On the map, the Animikie Group is the dark gray northeast-trending belt which ranges from south-central Minnesota, U.S., up to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The Gunflint Iron Range is the linear black formation labeled G, the Mesabi Iron Range is the jagged black linear formation labeled F, and Cuyuna Iron Range is the two black spots labeled E. The gabbro of the Duluth Complex, intruded during {{the formation of the}} Midcontinent Rift, separates the Mesabi and Gunflint iron ranges; it is shown by the speckled area wrapping around the western end of Lake Superior.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{rocks in}} the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region. These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists {{are found in the}} western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest. The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2°N. In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny. Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.|$|E
25|$|The Carrow {{formation}} is a predominantly fine-grained redbed (consisting of typically red sedimentary rocks) unit {{that has a}} grade ranging from pebbles and cobble in conglomerate at the base to mudstone laced with calcrete at the top. The flow is littered with abundant flows from the Seelys (in the intercaldera sequence) and Rothea (earlier) formation towards the southeast, but in the north <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks, which are sedimentary rocks exhibiting metamorphosis, predominate. The {{lower part of the}} formation consists of unwelded and highly compacted lapilli tuff with abundant amounts of pumice fragments. A basalt and basalt-clad mudflow occurs near the top if the formation in some places. A dated locality {{from the top of the}} formation has been dated to the Late Devonian, around 350 million years ago. The exposed part of the formation forms a long band around the South Oromocto Andesite formation, and is colored brown on the map.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} of K2 and Broad Peak, {{and the area}} westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the K2 Gneiss {{and part of the}} Karakroam Metamorphic Complex. The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers, who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the Gilkey-Puchoz sequence, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.|$|E
500|$|Due to down warping along {{elongate}} zones, each belt {{is essentially}} a large downfold or downfaulted block. The areas between individual belts are fault zones consisting of granite or granitic gneiss.

This process of plate tectonics compressed and grafted the marine sediments in the basin onto the mainland and uplifted {{them out of the}} sea. Later, these rocks were buried [...] under the surface and pressure-cooked into metamorphic rock. The resulting Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite, {{which is part of the}} Vishnu Basement Rocks, consists of the <b>metasedimentary</b> Vishnu Schist and the metavolcanic Brahma and Rama Schists that were formed 1.75billion to 1.73billion years ago. This is the resistant rock now exposed at the bottom of the canyon in the Inner Gorge.|$|E
500|$|The Quetico gneiss belt extends some [...] across Ontario {{and parts}} of Minnesota. The {{dominant}} rocks within the belt are schists and gneisses produced by intense metamorphism of greywackes and minor amounts of other sedimentary rocks. The sediments, alkalic plutons and felsic plutons are aged from 2,690 to 2,680million years. The metamorphism is relatively low-grade on the margins and high-grade in the center. The low-grade components of the greywackes were derived primarily from volcanic rocks; the high-grade rocks are coarser-grained and contain minerals that reflect higher temperatures. The granitic intrusions within the high-grade metasediments were produced by subduction of the ocean crust and partial melting of <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks.

500|$|The Highland Boundary Fault runs past Bute {{and through}} the {{northern}} part of Arran, so from a geological perspective some of the islands are in the Highlands and some in the Central Lowlands. As a result, Arran is sometimes referred to as [...] "Scotland in miniature" [...] and the island is a popular destination for geologists, who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and <b>metasedimentary</b> rocks ranging widely in age.
