25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you <b>move</b> <b>your</b> fire demon next to an {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E

500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic.

The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying to <b>move</b> <b>your</b> hips because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E

500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. If you <b>move</b> <b>your</b> fingers about, you get various little melodies... it amazes me that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E
500|$|The leading black entertainers {{of the day}} {{appeared}} at Club Harlem, including comedians Dick Gregory, George Kirby, Moms Mabley, and Slappy White; singers Cab Calloway, Billy Daniels, Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters; and jazz musicians Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, Wild Bill Davis, and Duke Ellington. Daniels first performed his signature song [...] "That Old Black Magic" [...] at Club Harlem in 1942. Guitarist Pat Martino has stated that as a younger man he would play at Smalls Paradise in New York City {{for six months and}} then perform in the summer at the Club Harlem. Racism, however, prohibited many of these performers from appearing at clubs {{on the south side of}} town, where white families lived. However, in the 1950s Frank Sinatra came from the 500 Club to Club Harlem to perform with Sammy Davis, Jr., and sang with Davis, a member of the Rat Pack, back at the 500 Club. Lonnie Smith recorded a live album, <b>Move</b> <b>Your</b> Hand, at Club Harlem in 1969. Even in its waning years in the 1970s, Club Harlem continued to attract contemporary black stars such as Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Redd Foxx, Marvin Gaye, Leslie Uggams, and Dionne Warwick.|$|E

Beyoncé appeared in the gym much to the delight of her young fans, who danced alongside her and took photos. Lauretta Charlton of Black Entertainment Television (BET) gave the video a positive review stating that [...] "It's impossible to watch without wanting to, well, <b>move</b> <b>your</b> body." [...] Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy showed great interest in the video and its message, stating that Beyoncé gets kids heart pumping, [...] "in more ways than one". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club added that [...] "if anything can help curb the nation's childhood obesity problem, it is the galvanizing power of Beyoncé Knowles dancing", and further praised how [...] " [...] bunch of cute kids [...] doing the Running Man and The Dougie in the cafeteria with Beyoncé." [...] A writer of Rap-Up described Beyoncé's dance moves in the video as [...] "hot". Mike Barthel of The Village Voice described the video as [...] "adorable" [...] and classified it as an [...] "important moment in the relationship between politics and culture". Barthel also praised the patriotic scene where Beyoncé and the kids wave the American flag, saying that [...] "It doesn't feel jingoistic, or pandering, or aggressive; it just feels celebratory, like they are actually kinda happy about America." ...|$|E

500|$|Yuji Horii, {{a fan of}} {{time travel}} fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the {{scenario}} of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, [...] "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm {{and come up with}} a variety of attractions to put in." [...] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as [...] "a long string of errands... 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'." [...] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an [...] "Active Time Event Logic" [...] system, [...] "where you can <b>move</b> <b>your</b> character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you", and with players [...] "talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions", allowing each scene to [...] "have many permutations." [...] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.|$|E
