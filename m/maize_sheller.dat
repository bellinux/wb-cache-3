25|$|A {{corn sheller}} or <b>maize</b> <b>sheller,</b> is a machine used to shell or shuck ears of sweet corn of their silk. By feeding ears of sweet corn into a {{concentric}} cylindrical rest, they are {{parallel to the}} axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed {{on one side of}} the machine. As the cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves, and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper, after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions. The corn sheller was invented by Lester E. Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12, 1839.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E
40|$|Two-wheel tractor (power tiller) is {{a common}} tillage tool in Bangladesh {{agriculture}} for easy access in fragmented land with affordable price of small farmers. Traditional <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> needs to be carried {{from place to place}} by hooking with two-wheel tractor (2 WT) and set up again for shelling operation which takes longer time for preparation of maize shelling. The mobile <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> eliminates the transportation problem and can start shelling operation instantly any place as it is attached together with 2 WT. It is counterclockwise rotating cylinder, axial flow type sheller, and grain separated with a frictional force between spike tooth and concave. The <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> is attached with nuts and bolts in front of the engine base of 2 WT. The operating power of the sheller comes from the fly wheel of the engine of the tractor through ‘V” belt pulley arrangement. The average shelling capacity of the mobile sheller is 2. 0 t/hr, broken kernel 2. 2 %, and shelling efficiency 97 %. The average maize shelling cost is Tk. 0. 22 /kg and traditional custom hire rate is Tk. 1. 0 /kg, respectively (1 US$=Tk. 78. 0). The service provider of the 2 WT can transport the mobile <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> long distance in operator’s seating position. The manufacturers started the fabrication of mobile <b>maize</b> <b>sheller.</b> This mobile <b>maize</b> <b>sheller</b> is also compatible for the other countries where 2 WT is available for farming operation...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} tractor-hiring unit of Edo state, Nigeria. The criteria used were fleet of equipment, personnel and workshop facilities {{and its impact on}} the farming populace in the state. The study adopted the use of a questionnaire and interview schedules. Among the information requested from the respondents were access to services rendered by the unit and increment in farm sizes. Records available at the headquarters and zonal offices of the unit provided additional sources of information. The unit has seven Steyr, 18 Fiat and nine Massey Ferguson tractors, eight ploughs, 17 harrows, seven tipping trailers, two boom sprayers, one fertilizer spreader, three <b>maize</b> <b>shellers,</b> two rotary slashers, one drilling machine, two ridgers and a pick-up van which are located in the various zones of the unit. Most of these equipment are either functional or require minor repairs to be used on the field. There is sufficient number of tractors but insufficient implements to fully utilize them. Workshop facilities and personnel are inadequate. The maintenance culture adopted is customer motivated. This is not a good practice as it has resulted in about 12 % of the equipment being abandoned as scraps. There has been a general increase in farmsizes since th...|$|R

The analysis considers different types of <b>Maize</b> <b>Sheller,</b> and inter-regional differences in agro-economic factors that influence the business rationale for investment. Maize Shellers are increasingly needed to serve demand from poultry sector because manual shelling is very laborious. Comparing with manual shelling, results indicate that power operated Maize Shellers look like a wise investment (5 – 8 acres for 25 % internal rate of return or IRR). However, it makes economic sense to operate shellers at higher capacities, and along with the high capital cost (Tk 1 18, 000 – 22, 000) to save large numbers of labours to farmers and maize traders. Therefore, power operated <b>Maize</b> <b>Sheller</b> can able to overcome the shortage of expensive labour during peak harvesting season...|$|E

5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and steering clutches. Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, <b>maize</b> <b>shellers</b> etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
40|$|This sheller uses {{abrasion}} {{between a}} rotating shelling-disc and stationary concave compartments {{to achieve the}} stripping. A manually-operated handle is used to rotate two shafts, one of which translates rotational motion to become linear motion of a slider crank. The slider pushes the maize cobs into the sheller continually one after another. Though manually operated, the sheller can provide a continuous flow; the kernels being collected via a chute. At a speed of 60 Â rpm, a shelling effectiveness of 67 % was achieved, with a low kernel-breakage factor of 0. 090 and a throughput of 6. 82 Â kg/h. For the trial runs, the machine was designed to shell a batch of 100 maize cobs, which were introduced into the feed hopper in one batch, without stopping until all the cobs were stripped via the shelling unit. This design is preferred, because of its rapid operation, low human-energy expenditure, low breakage-factor for the kernels as well as relatively little dust being emitted during shelling; hence leading to a relatively-healthier local atmosphere for the operator. Its wider use is therefore recommended. <b>Maize</b> Manual continuous-flow <b>sheller</b> Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Cue: It?s widely {{acknowledged}} that HIV and AIDS pose an enormous threat to food production {{in many of}} Africa?s agriculture-dependent countries. For anyone to die from AIDS is a tragedy, but in Africa, {{many of those who}} are dying are the backbone of the farming labour force. How can those who are left behind, the very old, the very young, the widows and the orphans, manage to grow the crops they require for their own food and income needs? One answer, being promoted by the NGO Africare, is the use of labour saving technologies, that allow cultivation of sufficient areas of land with much less human labour than has been needed in the past. Africare has designed new implements, such as ploughs, planters and harvesters, which can be operated even by old people or fairly young children. Chris Kakunta recently visited a field day in his home country of Zambia, {{to find out more about}} the equipment Africare is promoting. He sent us this report. IN:		?I am here at the Africare ?? OUT:		??You are most welcome. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Magoye, Zambia, on new labour-saving equipment being promoted by the NGO Africare. Transcript Kakunta	I am here at the Africare stand, Magoye, Mazibuka, some 150 km south of Lusaka. Africare is one of the NGOs that has come to exhibit some of their equipment that they are promoting among small scale farmers at this year?s field day, particularly to small scale farmers who are vulnerable. And with me is Munachoongo Muleya, the field officer with the organisation. To start with Munachoongo, what are some of these equipment that you are trying to promote? Muleya	What we are doing actually, we are looking at two main areas. We are looking at conservation tillage and crop processing. So what we have here are conservation tillage implements and we have post-harvest machinery. Kakunta	How can the farmers benefit from this equipment that you are promoting? Muleya	You know these days, Chris, we are talking of HIV and AIDS, and actually we are talking of farmers who have lost their animals due to Corridor [disease]. And what you can see here, we have the rippers, we have the groundnut lifter, we have the cultivators, we have the weed-sweep. These implements that you see can be used by a farmer who has maybe two oxen. That farmer can use and actually rip the field as much as he wants. Kakunta	Let?s take for instance the ripper, this one, which is looking like a small plough really. Muleya	Actually this ripper that we are seeing here, it?s a ripper that can be used by any farmer, and what we have done it we have just designed this attachment and then you put it onto the usual beam. You know these beams at our farms, the plough beams that we have, you know the farmers have this tendency of saying, ?No, they have brought up this new technology but it is very expensive. ? Everything now we are making, it has to be fitted on the old beam, the old plough beam that we have on our farm. So you just have to attach the ripper to the beam which we have; then you use it to make your own furrows at the farm. Kakunta	When you came up with all this equipment, what was in your mind? Muleya	You know if you go to the villages now, Chris, you only find the old and the young. And actually in the villages there, the people who do most of the work are the women. Now we are saying, since we have the old men there at the farms, we have the old men in the village, if we bring these implements, and you can see on that poster Chris, that?s a poster for a <b>maize</b> <b>sheller,</b> and that?s a poster for a ripper, you know these men they get interested. The next thing you can see there is the ripper planter. Instead of the women following the animals everyday, the man will just put on the ripper planter, put the seed, he will make the furrow, he will plant, and the same ripper planter you are seeing has a covering mechanism. You rip, then it plants behind, and it covers. Then it does three jobs at once. So it will be easier for the old men in the village there to do the work alone. Kakunta	How are the vulnerable, the women and children, the widows and orphans, how are they able to access some of this equipment. Do you have a mechanism in place? Muleya	We don?t give direct loans, but we work with lending institutions like micro-bankers trust, and women finance co-operatives. These people, when we go into the villages, we go with them, and the farmers are able to access money from these lending institutions and are able to buy our machines. I can give you an example; that group that you can see there is Manyama farmers group. They were able to access that peanut butter machine and now here in Magoye, these women are making peanut butter. That means the family and themselves, even their husbands - you can see that husband there is getting interested, because there is money coming out. And that peanut butter, actually, when you talk of HIV and AIDS, they can use it for the porridge, for the children. They can put it in relish. And you know it makes life easier. Kakunta	What about the health concerns. How are you addressing them? Muleya	Actually Chris, on health, it?s not direct, that we go to those people who are directly affected by HIV/AIDS. We are targeting those people who are there in the villages, who have remained. We are talking of the old and the young. You know, the old ladies who are looking after the orphans and those orphans who have been left; we don?t want these people to make excuses, that?s why we have made sure that we have these implements which are labour saving, which can be used by the old women - the ripper can be used by an old man, even a young boy. The ripper will just go, within two hours it will be a hectare. And that woman, what she needs is just to go and put in the seed when the rains come. That means that woman will be able to harvest; she won?t even make an excuse that she had nothing to use, and that?s why she is going hungry now. These farmers have to change with time, because everything is changing. Even the rains are changing. Then why don?t you change the implements that you are using as a farmer? Kakunta	I would like to thank you so much. Muleya	You are most welcome. End of track. Munachoongo Mulaya, a field officer with the NGO Africare explains how labour-saving farm equipment can be a major advantage for communities who have lost much of their manpower to diseases such as HIV/AID...|$|E
