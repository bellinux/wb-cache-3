Piecewise linear <b>membership</b> <b>functions</b> are employed to approximate the <b>membership</b> <b>functions</b> of the polynomial fuzzy model and polynomial fuzzy controller to facilitate stability analysis and controller synthesis with consideration of approximation error. The piecewise linear <b>membership</b> <b>functions</b> offer a nice property that the grades of membership are governed by a finite number of sampled points. It is worth mentioning that the piecewise linear <b>membership</b> <b>functions,</b> which are not necessarily implemented physically, are a tool to carry out the stability analysis.
