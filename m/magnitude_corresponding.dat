30|$|Hypothesis on {{electrostatic}} attraction mechanisms involving the hairy adhesion of climbing animals {{has been a}} matter of controversy for several years. The detection of tribocharge and forces at attachment organs of animals is a practical method of clarifying the dispute with respect to {{electrostatic attraction}} in the attachment of animals. Nonetheless, the tribo-electrification is rarely examined in the contact-adhesion of animals (especially in their free and autonomous attachment) {{due to the lack of}} available devices. Therefore, the present study involves establishing a method and an apparatus that enables synchronous detection of tribocharge and contact forces to study tribo-electrification in the free locomotion of geckos. A type of a combined sensor unit that consists of a three-dimensional force transducer and a capacitor-based charge probe is used to measure contact forces and tribocharge with a <b>magnitude</b> <b>corresponding</b> to several nano-Coulombs at a footpad of geckos when they climb vertically upward on an acrylic oligomer substrate. The experimental results indicate that tribocharge at the footpads of geckos is related to contact forces and contact areas. The measured charge allows the expectation of an exact attraction with <b>magnitude</b> <b>corresponding</b> to dozens of newtons per square meter and provides a probability of examining tribo-electrification in animal attachment from a macro level.|$|E

The average particle diameter can be reduced from 50 nm to approximately 10 nm in the presence of minor quantities of the cobalt(II) complex.

40|$|Abstract: If, as {{recently}} {{reported by the}} Super-Kamiokande collaboration, the neutrinos are massive, the heaviest one νH would not be stable and, though chargeless, could in particular decay into a lighter neutrino νL and a photon by quantum loop effects. The corresponding rate is computed in the standard model with massive Dirac neutrinos {{as a function of}} the neutrino masses and mixing angles. The lifetime of the decaying neutrino is estimated to be ≈ 10 44 years for a mass ≈ 5 × 10 − 2 eV. If kinematically possible, the νH → νL e + e − mode occurs at tree level and its one-loop radiative corrections get enhanced by a large logarithm of the electron mass acting as an infrared cutoff. Thus the νH → νL e + e − decay largely dominates the νH → νL γ one by several orders of <b>magnitude,</b> <b>corresponding</b> to a lifetime ≈ 10 − 2 year for a mass ≈ 1. 1 MeV...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of cosmological perturbations affects the background metric and matter configuration {{in which the}} perturbations propagate. This effect, studied {{a long time ago}} for gravitational waves, also is operational for scalar gravitational fluctuations, inhomogeneities which are believed to be more important in inflationary cosmology. The back-reaction of fluctuations can be described by an effective energy-momentum tensor. The issue of coordinate invariance makes the analysis more complicated for scalar fluctuations than for gravitational waves. We show that the back-reaction of fluctuations can be described in a diffeomorphism-invariant way. In an inflationary cosmology, the back-reaction is dominated by infrared modes. We show that these modes give a contribution to the effective energy-momentum tensor of the form of a negative cosmological constant whose absolute value grows in time. We speculate that this may lead to a self-regulating dynamical relaxation mechanism for the cosmological constant.
