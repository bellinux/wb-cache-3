25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On that morning," [...] Wrayson began, [...] "I {{returned}} home about twelve o'clock, let myself {{in with my}} own latch-key, and found a woman standing before <b>my</b> open <b>desk</b> going through <b>my</b> papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It must {{be either}} on or in <b>my</b> uncle's <b>desk,</b> {{or in his}} pocket. Will some one look for it? I wrote it in his {{memorandum}} book--a curious old black shagreen book, with a silver clasp. I left it open on the desk to dry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{must give}} you a purse and some money, and you must never go out without it, and don't mind {{spending}} a little money now and then, and giving away a penny when you feel inclined. Give me <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> and the keys." ...|$|R
500|$|In November 1961, John Houbolt {{had sent}} a paper advocating lunar orbit {{rendezvous}} (LOR) to Robert Seamans, the deputy administrator of NASA. As Shea remembered, [...] "Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt's letter to Brainerd Holmes [...] Holmes put the letter on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and said: Figure it out." [...] Shea {{became involved in the}} lunar orbit rendezvous decision {{as a result of this}} letter. While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous, Shea [...] "prided himself", according to space historians Murray and Cox, [...] "on going wherever the data took him". In this case, the data took him to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group, and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of my {{position}} and the reports which regularly crossed <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> I know that during my entire presidency of RTC [...] "fair game" [...] actions against enemies were daily routine. Apart from the legal tactics described below, the [...] "fair game" [...] activities included break-ins, libel, upsetting the companies of the enemy, espionage, harassment, misuse of confidential communications in the folders of community members and so forth.|$|E
60|$|The mysterious arrival had {{discovered}} the advantage of this particular shape. Entering my room, lighted strongly by a big bulkhead lamp swung on gimbals above <b>my</b> writing <b>desk,</b> I did not see him anywhere till he stepped out quietly from behind the coats hung in the recessed part.|$|R
60|$|Obedient at last, {{he raised}} himself from <b>my</b> dishevelled <b>desk,</b> and {{permitted}} me to half lift {{him to the}} floor. The gale of his grief had blown away his words; his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief. Reminiscence died in him--at least, the coherent part of it.|$|R
40|$|Working in an {{academic}} environment, {{the majority of my}} student interactions are based around a specific assignment. Every semester {{there is at least one}} assignment that comes across <b>my</b> reference <b>desk</b> that makes me throw my hands up in exasperation (such as: a scavenger hunt that was written before we moved much of our content [ [...] . ...|$|R
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things you want to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the 1992 {{election}} MacKenzie {{used the}} front-page headline [...] "If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: [...] "Prime Minister, I have on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2013, {{media reports}} documenting the {{existence}} and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for court-approved direct access to Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, reported from both The Washington Post and The Guardian published one hour apart. Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden's documents. He said the U.S. government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved, but Gellman decided that to name them [...] "would make it real to Americans." [...] Reports also revealed details of Tempora, a British black-ops surveillance program run by the NSA's British partner, GCHQ. The initial reports included details about NSA call database, Boundless Informant, and of a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans' phone records daily, the surveillance of French citizens' phone and Internet records, and those of [...] "high-profile individuals {{from the world of}} business or politics." [...] XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of [...] "almost anything done on the internet," [...] was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements: [...] "I, sitting at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> [...] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So practical!" [...] Philippa murmured. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I heard some one moving about, and I rang the alarm bell. Mills was downstairs almost {{directly}} and we heard some one running down the drive. The French windows were open, a chair was overturned in the library, and a drawer in <b>my</b> husband's <b>desk</b> was wide open." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found that}} {{paragraph}} {{the other day}} in <b>my</b> mother's <b>desk,</b> folded over the case of the medal of the Royal Humane Society, which Griff affected to despise, but which, when he was well out of the way, used to be exhibited on high days and holidays. It seems now like the boundary mark of the golden days of our boyhood, and unmitigated hopes for one another.|$|R
6000|$|That {{deliberate}} insult was {{all that}} I wanted to make me completely mistress of myself. I told Michael to wait a moment, and opened <b>my</b> writing <b>desk.</b> I wrote on an envelope the address in London of a faithful old servant, who had attended my mother in her last moments. I gave it to Michael. [...] "Call there to-morrow morning," [...] I said. [...] "You will find me waiting for you." ...|$|R
60|$|I went {{quickly to}} <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{unlocked}} it, {{and took out}} a photograph.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} again at <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and made another attempt to write to Mr. Playmore.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{the first}} to recover, holding his face in her hands, turned towards the moonlight, her own in passionate shadow. [...] "Listen," [...] she said quickly. [...] "They think I came here to look for {{something}} I left in <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> They thought it high fun to come with me--these two. I did come to look for something--not in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> but yours." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{no plans}} and instead of {{answering}} I shrugged my shoulders and looked round the apartment. There was a statue of the Virgin upon <b>my</b> uncle's <b>desk.</b> I looked at its face, as he was wont {{to look in the}} midst of his labor. I saw there eternal peace. The air became luminous with an infinite net-work of the jeweled rings of Paradise descending in roseate clouds upon us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit at your <b>desk,</b> <b>my</b> dear," [...] she said. [...] "I'm {{all right}} now. That water was good. How good cold things can be! Sit down {{at your desk}} and let me sit here. And then I will talk to you. I've had such a time, my dear. Ah!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Harman {{grew up in}} Woldingham, and {{was educated}} at elite Dulwich College. However, he found school difficult: [...] "I was never {{comfortable}} sitting down. I always wanted {{to get involved in}} something, not just learn and write. I was in so much trouble I had <b>my</b> own <b>desk</b> in detention." [...] His father was a bank manager, but also involved in amateur dramatics including work with Croydon Operatic and Dramatic Association (CODA), an interest which was passed on to Harman. His mother was also involved in the productions, but she died when Harman was 18.|$|R
60|$|I'm {{going to}} stick close to <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> for a month, now, hoping to write a small book.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned over}} some papers on <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{just to show}} Ralph that he hadn't succeeded in {{disturbing}} me.|$|E
60|$|I HAD {{sent the}} {{housekeeper}} {{out of my}} study. I was alone, with the photograph of the Frenchwoman on <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is serious. Turtles live {{in every}} nook and cranny of my house–on shelves, in bookcases, on the mantle over the fireplace, in a special cabinet with glass doors that’s filled to overcrawling, in the cubbies of <b>my</b> rolltop <b>desk.</b> It all started when I became {{director}} of the Cognitive Sciences Center at the University of Minnesota in the late 1970 s, and my family discovered that the turtle is the logo of the Center. The first carved turtle, a gift from my wife, came into my life innocently enough, but they have multiplied beyond imagination and the situation has gotten out of control...|$|R
6000|$|Two hours {{have passed}} since Mr. Franklin left me. As soon as his back was turned, I went to <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> to start the story. There I have sat {{helpless}} (in spite of my abilities) ever since; seeing what Robinson Crusoe saw, as quoted above--namely, the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength {{to go through with}} it. Please to remember, I opened the book by accident, at that bit, only the day before I rashly undertook the business now in hand; and, allow me to ask--if THAT isn't prophecy, what is? ...|$|R
40|$|On {{an early}} fall day in September 1962 I sat quietly, thoughtfully, at <b>my</b> large <b>desk</b> {{in a newly}} renovated corner office in the old Crane wing of the Lillie Building, Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Looking out through high, ancient windows, I could see the busy main street of Woods Hole in the foreground, Martha's Vineyard beyond, behind me the MBL Stone Candle House, across the street the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and to the far right, the Biological Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) (Fig. 1). Down the inner hall from my office {{stretched}} renovated quarters for the fledgling, ongoing, year-round MBL Systematics-Ecology Program (SEP), which I {{had been invited to}} direct...|$|R

6000|$|While uttering my {{shocking}} doctrines (entrenched {{behind a}} broad, book-laden <b>desk),</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{were attracted to}} {{the face of a}} slender black-bearded young man whose shining eyes and occasional smiling nod indicated a joyous agreement with the main points of my harangue. I had never seen him before, but I at once recognized in him a fellow conspirator against [...] "The Old Hat" [...] forces of conservatism in painting.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few days}} I was quietly {{established}} in my new quarters; my books all arranged, <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> placed by a window looking out into the field; and I felt as snug as Robinson Crusoe, {{when he had finished}} his bower. For several days I enjoyed all the novelty of change and the charms which grace a new lodgings before one has found out their defects. I rambled about the fields where I fancied Goldsmith had rambled. I explored merry Islington; ate my solitary dinner at the Black Bull, which according to tradition was a country seat of Sir Walter Raleigh, and would sit and sip my wine and muse on old times in a quaint old room, where many a council had been held.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{explained}} here that my cabin had {{the form of}} the capital letter L, the door being within the angle and opening into the short part of the letter. A couch was to the left, the bed place to the right; <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> and the chronometers' table faced the door. But anyone opening it, unless he stepped right inside, had no view of what I call the long (or vertical) part of the letter. It contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase; and a few clothes, a thick jacket or two, caps, oilskin coat, and such like, hung on hooks. There was at the bottom of that part a door opening into my bathroom, which could be entered also directly from the saloon. But that way was never used.|$|R
