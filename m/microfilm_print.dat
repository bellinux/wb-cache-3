50|$|An {{aperture}} card {{is a type}} of punched card with a cut-out window into which a chip of microfilm is mounted. Such a card is used for archiving or for making multiple inexpensive copies of a document for ease of distribution. The card is typically punched with machine-readable metadata associated with the <b>microfilm</b> image, and <b>printed</b> {{across the top of the}} card for visual identification. The microfilm chip is most commonly 35mm in height, and contains an optically reduced image, usually of some type of reference document, such as an engineering drawing, that is the focus of the archiving process. Aperture cards have several advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital systems. Machinery exists to automatically store, retrieve, sort, duplicate, create, and digitize cards with a high level of automation. While many {{aperture card}}s still play an important role in archiving, their role is gradually being replaced by digital systems.|$|R

40|$|CONTEMPORARY HISTORIANS TELL us {{that this}} is a visual vorld, that television, film, videotapes and {{advertising}} are the documents of the time, and that the medium in all forms is the message. If that is the case, then art librarians must put emphasis on the nonbook materials-those ephemeral, fugitive items which pass through our hands-as the very essence, the most important visual keys to man's history of the twentieth century. Art librarians, bombarded each day with visual documents, must create some of cutting through this visual chaos and systematically collect, index, and distribute these art ephemera. Identifying these works is of the utmost importance. Manuscripts, maps, posters, pamphlets, <b>microfilm,</b> bookplates, postcards, <b>prints,</b> calendars, exhibition announcements, scrapbooks and photographs, to name a fe v, form the core of the visual library and serve as the primary sources and documentation for present and future art historians. It is not just the book that serves as the traditional means of research, but it is the documentation of this ephemeral and fugitive material that will serve to create the close relationship between the experience of the artist and the experience of the researcher. The first matter at hand is that art librarians are really not trained in library school or even on the job to recognize the bibliography of art, ḣichare not only books but reproductions, slides, videotapes, films on art, and the material mentioned above. Thus, to recognize the dignity of the documentation allows {{as a matter of course}} for its inherent preservation. If ve fail to recognize the importance of this visual data, it vill slip between our fingers, never to be retrieved, never to be preserved, never to be entertained as important...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will focus on}} the virtual {{academic}} library as a place and as a structure or shell for serial information access and services. Specifically, I will relate some of our practical experience of planning, building and organizing library services in the new Kelvin Smith Library, just opened, on the campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The library was planned and designed from the start to be a "library of the future" or "virtual library" and relies heavily on supply of information through electronic resources as well as through traditional means. We will present what we see as the future from our experience and will present a model which is serial based, our "shared digital library" which is based on the proven success of cooperative bibliographic database efforts such as OCLC and RLIN. The future of serials, at least the next twenty years, will probably be a meshing of supply sources and access options. These will include traditional print on paper journals, current periodical areas, and bound journal stacks, both on-site and off-site with linked storage facilities. Becoming more important, however, is the supply of serial information through the new technologies, including networked, licensed CD-ROMs, networked e-journals with cataloging and integration in the database and linked through subject gateways, publisher e-journal projects, such as Johns Hopkins Project Muse, Elsevier ESS, etc. Regional consortia document delivery projects, such as OhioLink, are and will also {{play an important role in}} efficient and economical serial information supply, as will direct commercial document delivery services, such as Uncover, CISTI, Swets and EBSCO ventures. I will describe some of the OhioLink experience in negotiating and coordinating between publishers and member libraries. An important component of our 'virtual library' services is our project supported by Mellon, which focuses on organizing information supply in the chemical sciences. It is a collaborative approach to the Chemical Sciences Virtual Library, and models itself after the OCLC and RLIN database systems which were so successful in consolidating and sharing catalog information and records. It is a system which has already worked. The cornerstone of our concept of a 'shared digital library' involves the creation of bodies of digital documents in an area in which libraries can make a real contribution, that is undertaking a digital retrospective conversion full-text, whether images, searchable text, etc. The project makes use of library staff as a labor pool and works with publishers to build a low-cost retrospective database of digital resources for which the publisher could charge royalties. The shared digital library, or SDL, will consist of several components, including image servers, input devices, an indexing component (or linked to commercial indexes), rights management software and the Internet (or its successor) as the network for distribution. Of course, the difficult part of doing serials in the new virtual library is in being able to separate the good new options from the bad, choosing those which are appropriate for your library and its constituencies, and in balancing "keeping on top of the new" with supplying serials that students and faculty need now. The options are not only in the areas of format and supply vehicle, ie <b>print,</b> <b>microfilm,</b> electronic CD-ROM, networked, hypertext linked, and online archive sources. They also appear to include acquisitions methods, ie traditional subscription agents and vendors, and "new"software-based, bank-linked subscription services. We will cover options we have explored and our success and otherwise with them. This is the challenge we are facing in our new library, and one which everyone in North America and Great Britain is facing to one degree or another. It is a major transition period in which some supply sources will ebb and decline in proportion to others, some will and have already turned out to be "dead ends" - we hope to be fortunate enough not to invest heavily in any of these. (We feel the Shared Digital Library approach is one that could have applications elsewhere.) It will take more technical savvy, more serials experience, keeping abreast of what is available, what is working and what is not, just being lucky to make it all work smoothly, and to get to the next stage without sacrificing good service now...|$|R
