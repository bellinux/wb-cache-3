5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, {{and he could not}} see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E
5|$|Following their coordinated uprising, Michael the Brave {{attacked}} Ottoman strongholds {{along the}} Danube and recovered Giurgiu and Brăila, while Aaron the Tyrant seized Ismail (now in Ukraine). In response, the sultan ordered the Grand Vizier, Sinan Pasha to invade Wallachia. The two princes needed {{the support of}} Sigismund Báthory who {{took advantage of the}} situation to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> suzerain of Wallachia and Moldavia. When Aaron the Tyrant refused Sigismund Báthory's conditions, he was replaced by the latter's protégé, Ştefan Răzvan (1595) on the throne.|$|E

6000|$|Indeed the Publican is here {{found to}} recant, and repent of his {{condition}}, {{and of the}} condition that he had put himself into; and the Pharisee to boast of his. But the Publican's repentance was not of himself, but of God, who can also, yea, and sometimes it is evident (Acts ix.) he doth, make Pharisees also repent of that condition that they have chosen to be in themselves; Phil. iii. 3-8. The Pharisee, therefore, in commending of <b>himself,</b> <b>makes</b> <b>himself</b> never the better; the Publican also, in condemning of <b>himself,</b> <b>makes</b> <b>himself</b> never the worse.

5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|While Morrowind {{contains}} many quests and storylines, the central plot revolves around The Tribunal, a triumvirate of god-like beings ruling over Morrowind, and their struggle against a former ally, the deity Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House – a cult of followers stretching out from Red Mountain, the volcanic center of Vvardenfell, the island {{on which the}} game is set. Dagoth Ur has used the Heart of Lorkhan, an artifact of great power, to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> immortal and now seeks to drive the Imperial Legion occupiers from Morrowind using his network of spies, as well as Akulakhan, an enormous mechanical golem powered by the Heart of Lorkhan.|$|E
5|$|As Rand's story begins, he is {{restoring}} {{order in}} the nation of Arad Doman while searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the Forsaken. The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Correspondence between the Duke and Kenneth de Courcy, dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where the Duke would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible regency. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned about the influence of the Mountbatten family over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested that the Duke buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> available should the King become incapacitated. The Duke however hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 {{that he had}} simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{was less}} {{successful}} in his penultimate season in 196768, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria. A decision by administrators to introduce Sunday {{play into the}} Sheffield Shield ended his career, as he refused to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> available for games that involved Sunday play. He played in only one match in his final season in 196869, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 197677, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 197475. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-time run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition {{at the time of}} his retirement, but has now dropped to ninth.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), {{because of the way}} in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as a reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
5|$|Holy Roman {{emperors}} {{had been}} elected from the House of Habsburg {{for most of the}} previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to Francis of Lorraine. Francis relinquished the Duchy of Lorraine near France in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany near Austria to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> a more appealing candidate for eventual election as emperor. On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. Two key exceptions, the duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election. When Charles died in 1740, Maria Theresa had to fight for her family's entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E

5|$|In January 2114, 42 {{years after}} the Citadel events and 12 years into {{rebuilding}} TriOptimum, the company created an experimental FTL starship, the Von Braun, which is now on its maiden voyage. The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel, the Rickenbacker, which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of Edward Diego, the Citadel Station's infamous commander and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action. Because the Rickenbacker {{does not have an}} FTL system of its own, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> the captain of the Von Braun despite being inexperienced.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick officially {{took office}} on 1 July 1967. As chairman, Madgwick took a {{somewhat}} hands-off approach to directing the organisation, preferring to provide his opinion {{as to how}} things should operate, then deferring to his administrators {{to decide what to}} do. Madgwick considered his position as similar to a university president, with managers and producers equivalent to professors and researchers. He bought a home in Mosman to be closer to the ABC's main Broadcast House in Sydney. Madgwick tried to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> available by walking around the offices and facilities and amiably conversing with all ABC employees. He was subsequently described as the most popular chairman {{in the history of the}} organisation. Madgwick was given a second term as chairman in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{seems to}} have {{continued}} even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan {{on account of his}} supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> king or was acting on behalf of Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority.|$|E
5|$|Vorster and the SACA {{followed}} D'Oliveira's form closely {{throughout the}} tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster {{was convinced that the}} MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances. He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him. The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would mean no tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Fizzwidget is {{unaware of}} the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held on planet Boldan, only to {{discover}} {{it to be a}} trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss, after cancelling their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp. Captured, the pair find themselves transported to Aranos and aboard the same vessel, now being used as a remote prison, but manage to escape confinement. Discovering that Angela was captured by them, the pair track the mercenaries to their hideout on planet Snivelak, defeating their boss and saving Angela. Intent on stopping Fizzwidget, the group head for MegaCrop's Headquarters, only to discover that the CEO is none other than disgraced hero Captain Qwark. In a bid to restore his reputation, Qwark took over MegaCorp as Fizzwidget, with the intention of unleashing the Protopet upon the galaxy, so he can use a device created by Angela to defeat the creatures and <b>make</b> <b>himself</b> famous again. When he demonstrates the device, however, it malfunctions and transforms the original Protopet into a gigantic beast that devours him. While Angela goes to rescue the real Fizzwidget, Ratchet subdues the Protopet and saves Qwark's life. With Clank's help, Angela fixes the device and broadcasts a signal through MegaCorp's TV transponders, neutralizing the Protopets and restoring peace to the Bogon galaxy.|$|E
