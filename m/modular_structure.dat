5|$|The {{architecture}} and internal layout of these missions followed a scheme which was repeated later with some {{variations in the}} rest of the missionary reductions. In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a <b>modular</b> <b>structure,</b> the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on one side and the houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides. The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes. Despite being based on the same basic model, the towns of Chiquitos nonetheless show remarkable variations. For example, the orientation of the settlements toward the cardinal points differed and was determined by individual circumstances.|$|E

Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The performance required 500 outfits, including customized costumes for the musical guests and assisting performers. The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The <b>modular</b> <b>structure</b> was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Modular</b> <b>structures</b> are {{ubiquitous}} across {{various types}} of biological networks. The study of network modularity can help reveal regulatory mechanisms in systems biology, evolutionary biology and developmental biology. Identifying putative <b>modular</b> latent <b>structures</b> from high-throughput data using exploratory analysis can help better interpret the data and generate new hypotheses. Unsupervised learning methods designed for global dimension reduction or clustering fall short of identifying modules with factors acting in linear combinations. Results We present an exploratory data analysis method named MLSA (<b>Modular</b> Latent <b>Structure</b> Analysis) to estimate <b>modular</b> latent <b>structures,</b> which can find co-regulative modules that involve non-coexpressive genes. Conclusions Through simulations and real-data analyses, we show that the method can recover <b>modular</b> latent <b>structures</b> effectively. In addition, the method also performed very well on data generated from sparse global latent factor models. The R code is available at [URL]. </p...|$|R

25|$|It {{has also}} been found that 29 types of {{collagen}} {{have been found to}} exist in humans. This vast group can further be divided into several families according to their primary structures and supramolecular organization. Among the many types of collagens, only the fibrillar and the basement membrane (type IV) collagens have been found in the sponges and cnidarians, which are the two earliest branching metazoan lineages. Studies have focused on the origin of fibrillar collagen molecules. In Sponges, there exist three clades of fibrillar molecules, A, B and C. It is proposed that only the B clade fibrillar collagens preserved their characteristic <b>modular</b> <b>structure</b> from sponge to human.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{interactions}} {{provide a}} powerful perspective into gene function, but {{our knowledge of}} the specific mechanisms that give rise to these interactions is still relatively limited. The availability of a global genetic interaction map in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, covering ∼ 30 % of all possible double mutant combinations, provides an unprecedented opportunity for an unbiased assessment of the native structure within genetic interaction networks and how it relates to gene function and modular organization. Toward this end, we developed a data mining approach to exhaustively discover all block structures within this network, which allowed for its complete modular decomposition. The resulting <b>modular</b> <b>structures</b> revealed the importance of the context of individual genetic interactions in their interpretation and revealed distinct trends among genetic interaction hubs as well as insights into the evolution of duplicate genes. Block membership also revealed a surprising degree of multifunctionality across the yeast genome and enabled a novel association of VIP 1 and IPK 1 with DNA replication and repair, which is supported by experimental evidence. Our modular decomposition also provided a basis for testing the between-pathway model of negative genetic interactions and within-pathway model of positive genetic interactions. While we find that most <b>modular</b> <b>structures</b> involving negative genetic interactions fit the between-pathway model, we found that current models for positive genetic interactions fail to explain 80 % of the <b>modular</b> <b>structures</b> detected. We also find differences between the <b>modular</b> <b>structures</b> of essential and nonessential genes...|$|R

These components were essentially the same as for the Patrie, the only differences initially being in the dimensions of the envelope and the ballonet, which are given in the Specifications section below.

2500|$|Within a year Microsoft {{licensed}} MS-DOS to over 70 other companies. It {{was designed}} to be an OS that could run on any 8086-family computer. Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for CP/M, and with MS-DOS emulating the same solution as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a <b>modular</b> <b>structure</b> with internal device drivers, minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The OEM would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of [...] "MS-DOS" [...] for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [...] machine. [...] Some machines, like the Tandy 2000, were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM-compatible, so they could run software written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture.|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a {{heterogeneous}} and complex disease, a clear manifestation of this is its classification into different molecular subtypes.

In this work, we identify <b>modular</b> <b>structures</b> on gene transcriptional networks previously inferred from microarray data of molecular subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A, luminal B, basal, and HER 2 -enriched. We analyzed the modules (communities) found in each network to identify particular biological functions (described in the Gene Ontology database) associated to them. We further explored these modules and their associated functions to identify common and unique features that could allow a better level of description of breast cancer, particularly in the basal-like subtype, the most aggressive and poor prognosis manifestation. Our findings related to the immune system and a decrease in cell death-related processes in basal subtype could help to understand it and design strategies for its treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] Morphology {{development}} of marine plankton, {{which has a}} five hundred million evolutional history, is really diversifying fitted to environmental changes. We focus on not only biological functions but also mechanical functions due to the environmental factor of temperature, chemical substance, boundary condition, etc., however the current classification pays attention to only morphological appearance. In addition, we try to design space systems inspired by these plankton, because plankton in water is released from gravity due to buoyancy effect similar to a structure in space. The boundary condition of floating plankton is free-free also like that of floating space structures. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical <b>modular</b> <b>structures,</b> which are composed of many hierarchically connected unit modules. This modular approach is effective for the large-sized space structure since a small size unit module is convenient for the ground test and production.
