40|$|We {{report on}} partial and global {{generalized}} synchronization in exemplar bidirectionally coupled non-identical chaotic systems with <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delays. We derive conditions for such synchronization regimes. The general approach {{is applied to}} the case of <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delay laser systems with electro-optical feedback. We also study the effect of signal sampling on the signatures of time delays in the autocorrelation function of the <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delay laser output. Comment: 12 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{data mining}} method for synthesizing <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> series is presented. Based {{on a single}} time series algorithm, the method embeds <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> series into a phase space. The reconstructed state space allows {{temporal}} pattern extraction and local model development. Using an a priori data mining objective, an optimal local model is chosen for short-term forecasting. For the same sampling period, <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> series embedding produces better temporal patterns than single time series embedding. The method is applied to a financial time series...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{exponential}} stability (with convergence rate α) of uncertain linear {{systems with}} <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delays is studied in this paper. Using the characteristic function of linear time-delay system, stability criteria are derived to guarantee α-stability. Sufficient conditions are also obtained for exponential stability of uncertain parametric systems with <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delays. For two-dimensional time-invariant system with <b>multiple</b> <b>time</b> delays, the proposed stability criteria are {{shown to be}} less conservative {{than those in the}} literature. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity of our new stability criteria...|$|R
