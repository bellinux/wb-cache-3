40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to local nonlinear effects in cosmic microwave background anisotropies, and discuss the qualitative features of these effects. New couplings of the baryonic velocity to <b>radiation</b> <b>multipoles</b> are found, arising from nonlinear Thomson scattering effects. We also find a new nonlinear shear effect on small angular scales. The full set of evolution and constraint equations is derived, including the nonlinear generalizations of the <b>radiation</b> <b>multipole</b> hierarchy, and of the dynamics of multi-fluids. These equations govern radiation anisotropies in any inhomogeneous spacetime, but their main application is to second-order effects in a universe that is close to the Friedmann models.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to local nonlinear effects in cosmic microwave background anisotropies, and discuss the qualitative features of these effects. We find new couplings of baryonic velocity to <b>radiation</b> <b>multipoles</b> through Thomson scattering, and a new nonlinear shear effect on small angular scales. This is the second paper of a series which develops a covariant and gauge-invariant approach to the Einstein-Boltzmann-hydrodynamic equations in an inhomogeneous universe. The first paper developed the covariant algebra of anisotropies. Here we present the covariant dynamics, i. e. the nonlinear evolution and constraint equations that govern the <b>radiation</b> <b>multipoles</b> and the local quantities describing inhomogeneity. Our nonlinear equations provide a direct basis for a covariant second-order analysis of temperature anisotropies in a universe that is close to the Friedmann models. We identify the nonlinearities that arise from inhomogeneity and relative motions, and describe their effect on radiation anisotropies. The nonlinear equations are also specialized to the case of nearly isotropic radiation in universes where the anisotropy and inhomogeneity are not limited to be small, which includes the case when the background spacetime is a Bianchi model. Finally, we covariantly and gauge-invariantly linearize the equations about a Friedmann background, which is the basis for a covariant analysis of scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. Such an analysis, and other applications of the equations given here, are taken up in further papers of the series...|$|R
40|$|Information {{exchange}} {{by means}} of separate complex photons In this paper we try to motivate the possibility of information transmission {{by means of}} individual complex photons. The characteristic features of the transfer, in particular, its large penetration and weak determination are considered. Assumptions are made about the approaches to experimental verification of the phenomenon Key words: photon, angular momentum, projection of the momentum, the wave function, information, quantum, spectrum. The usual exchange of information through an electromagnetic field is produced using: • sufficiently strong signals as a stream of numerous photons, • the most simple dipole radiation. The question arises: {{is it possible to}} transmit information by generating complex photons that carry information inside? But the literature shows only a theory of <b>multipole</b> photons <b>radiation</b> with the assumption that the photon wavelength is much larger than the size of the radiating system [1, 2].

40|$|In {{the manner}} of Segre and Helmholz it has been {{possible}} using an expansion in spherical waves and elementary vector analysis methods to derive expressions for the field intensities resulting from electric and magnetic dipole radiation and electric quadrupole radiation {{in terms of the}} corresponding moments of the nucleus.

In this paper he considers the expression for the vector potential resulting from electric dipole radiation and then generalizes to obtain the vector potentials resulting from electric and magnetic 2 -pole radiation. A further discussion of these results is given by Dancoff and Morrison. A completely different approach to the problem is given here in which the total field intensities resulting from a nuclear radiation are broken into two parts, one resulting from electric <b>multipole</b> <b>radiation,</b> and the other resulting from magnetic <b>multipole</b> <b>radiation.</b> The parts are in turn written {{in the form of an}} expansion, the individual terms of which are the field intensities for the various orders of <b>multipole</b> <b>radiation</b> present.

40|$|The {{scattering}} of electromagnetic radiation by linearized gravitational fields is studied to second order in a perturbation expansion.

No case has been found, however, in which any electromagnetic <b>multipole</b> <b>radiation</b> is scattered by gravitational fields of quadrupole or higher-order multipole structure. This lack of scattering is established for infinite classes of special cases, and is conjectured to hold in general.

40|$|Motivated by {{the desire}} to test {{modified}} gravity theories exhibiting the Vainshtein mechanism, we solve in various physically relevant limits, the retarded Galileon Green’s function (for the cubic theory) about a background sourced by a massive spherically symmetric static body. The static limit of our result will aid us, in a forthcoming paper, in understanding the impact of Galileon fields on the problem of motion in the solar system. In this paper, we employ this retarded Green’s function to investigate the emission of Galileon radiation generated by the motion of matter lying deep within the Vainshtein radius rv of the central object: acoustic waves vibrating on its surface, and the motion of compact bodies gravitationally bound to it. If λ is the typical wavelength of the emitted radiation, and r 0 is the typical distance of the source from the central mass, with r 0 ≪rv, then, compared to its noninteracting massless scalar counterpart, we find that the Galileon radiation rate is suppressed by the ratio (rv/λ) - 3 / 2 at the monopole and dipole orders at high frequencies rv/λ≫ 1. However, at high enough <b>multipole</b> order, the <b>radiation</b> rate is enhanced by powers of rv/r 0.
