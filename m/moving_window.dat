40|$|Several {{studies in}} {{software}} effort estimation {{have found that}} it can be effective to use a window of recent projects as training data for building an effort estimation model. Windows can be defined as hav- ing a fixed size (containing a fixed number of projects), or as having a fixed duration. A recent study extended the idea of windows, by weight- ing projects differently according to their order within the window, and found that weighted <b>moving</b> <b>windows</b> could significantly improve estima- tion accuracy. That study used fixed-size windows. This study examines the effect on effort estimation accuracy of weighted <b>moving</b> <b>windows</b> that are based on fixed duration. We compare weighted and unweighted mov- ing windows under the same experimental settings. Weighting methods are found to improve estimation accuracy significantly in larger windows, and the methods also significantly improved accuracy in smaller windows in terms of MRE.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{changes to}} the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) model to improve performance on wall-sized, high-resolution tiled displays. VNC does not fully utilize data distributed to the tiles, noticeably reducing interactive performance when panning images and <b>moving</b> <b>windows.</b> By de-centralizing the VNC model, the VNC viewers can exchange pixels amongst each other, improving performance. The VNC server changes from individually servicing viewer requests, to servicing the viewers once everyone has requested an update. The model is implemented, and its performance documented through experiments. When panning images, the number of pixels refreshed is increased three times or more, while reducing the server’s bandwidth by 74 % and CPU load by 35 %. When <b>moving</b> <b>windows,</b> the number of pixels refreshed is increased {{by a factor of}} 1. 8, while reducing the server’s bandwidth by 68 % and CPU load by 19. 7 %.

50|$|The gaze-contingent {{technique}} {{is the basis}} of various experimental paradigms, each of them allowing to investigate specific cognitive processes.In the <b>moving</b> <b>window</b> paradigm (e.g., Reder, 1973; McConkie & Rayner, 1975) only the part of the visual field around the gaze location (foveal information) is displayed normally, the surrounding part of the visual field (extrafoveal and peripheral information) being altered (removed for visual scenes or replaced by chains of X in reading).The moving mask paradigm (e.g. Rayner & Bertera, 1979) is a reverse technique in comparison with the <b>moving</b> <b>window</b> paradigm. It dynamically obscures central vision (or replaces letters with X in reading), permitting only extrafoveal information use. In the boundary paradigm (e.g., Rayner, 1975; Balota, Pollatsek & Rayner, 1985; Miellet & Sparrow, 2004), an extrafoveal prime (a homophone in reading for example) is replaced by the target stimulus when the eyes cross an invisible boundary around the target area.The parafoveal magnification paradigm (Miellet, O'Donnell & Sereno, 2009) compensates for how visual acuity drops off as a function of retinal eccentricity. On each fixation and in real time, parafoveal text is magnified to equalize its perceptual impact with that of concurrent foveal text.|$|E
