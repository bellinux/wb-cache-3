Rush lights fuelled by <b>mutton</b> <b>fat</b> were available, but they were expensive. A shuttered hole in the roof served as a chimney.|$|E
25|$|The Hadendoa Beja of Northeast Africa {{were called}} Fuzzy-Wuzzies by British colonial troops during the Mahdist War {{of the late}} 19th century due to their often large and mop-like hairstyles, which they shaped by {{applying}} butter or <b>mutton</b> <b>fat.</b> In Somalia, some young men of the nomadic and sedentary communities would grow their hair long and carefully comb it into rather large bushes, which they would then hold in place with ghee. This elaborate hairstyle was quite distinct from another coiffure found among other Somalis, who would instead grow long and fluff out their fine, straight hair and place a chewing stick and comb in the center.|$|E

The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{chapters}} address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or {{ways of dealing}} with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history. For example, chapter V, Meat, discusses [...] "a rather interesting mediaeval miracle" [...] and illustrates a traditional [...] "Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net". The text switches repeatedly from instructions ("To prepare <b>mutton</b> <b>fat</b> for a mutton piecrust, melt it over a bowl of hot water") to historical asides ("Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys"). Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and frothing, switching between the past and present tenses: [...] "Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: These {{sausages}} were manufactured with <b>mutton</b> {{and tail}} <b>fat</b> by starter culture. The microbiological of fermented mutton sausages were evaluated {{to determine their}} quality characteristics during ripening and storage. Two groups of fermented sausages manufacture using the same technology were named control group (CO) and starter culture group (SC). In this study, Lactic acid bacteria counts in sausages made with combinations of starter cultures increased to 8 logcfu/g. The total bacteria counts in the SC were lower (P < 0. 05) than in the control (CO) after drying and storage time. During ripening, total bacterial counts in the SC were 7 logcfu/g, which was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than in the CO. The Micrococci-staphylococci counts of the SC were 6 logcfu/g and significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than of the CO during ripening...|$|R

But it would not do to be inactive. Some step must be taken immediately. A meeting of the citizens was called, and two old men were appointed to go and talk to the Griffin. They were instructed to offer to prepare a splendid dinner for him on equinox day,--one which would entirely satisfy his hunger. They would offer him the <b>fattest</b> <b>mutton,</b> the most tender beef, fish, and game of various sorts, and any thing of the kind that he might fancy. If none of these suited, they were to mention that there was an orphan asylum in the next town.|$|R

60|$|Muller swung {{himself from}} the saddle and entered the hut, pushing open the cranky, broken-hinged door with a kick. He found the box of Tandstickor matches, and, after one or two attempts--due chiefly to his shaking hand--succeeded in {{striking}} fire and lighting a coarse dip such as the Boers make out of <b>mutton</b> <b>fat.</b> Near the candle were a bottle of peach brandy two thirds full, a tin pannikin and a jug of river water. Seizing the pannikin, he half filled it with spirit, added a little water, and drank off the mixture. Then he took the meat and bread from the same shelf, and, cutting some of each with his clasp-knife, tried to eat. But he could not swallow much, and soon gave up the attempt, consoling himself instead with the brandy.|$|E
60|$|After he {{had gone}} the lawyer {{produced}} pen and ink and wrote out the statement, putting in it all the lies that I had told, and copying the extract from the fly-leaf of the Bible.

Now at last he gave me the paper to sign. Besides the candles on the table, which being of <b>mutton</b> <b>fat</b> had burnt out, there was a lamp fed with whale's oil, but this also was dying, the oil being exhausted, so that its flame, which had sunk low, jumped from time to time with a little noise, giving out a blue light. In that unholy blue light, which turned our faces ghastly pale, the lawyer and I looked at each other as I sat before him, the pen in my hand, and in his eyes I read that he was certain that I was about to sign to a wicked lie, and in mine he read that I knew it to be a lie.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vholes's office, in {{disposition}} retiring and in situation retired, is squeezed up in {{a corner}} and blinks at a dead wall. Three feet of knotty-floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes's jet-black door, in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest midsummer morning and encumbered by a black bulk-head of cellarage staircase against which belated civilians generally strike their brows. Mr. Vholes's chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk can open the door without getting off his stool, while the other who elbows him at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire. A smell as of unwholesome sheep blending with the smell of must and dust is referable to the nightly (and often daily) consumption of <b>mutton</b> <b>fat</b> in candles and to the fretting of parchment forms and skins in greasy drawers. The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close. The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man, and the two chimneys smoke, and there is a loose outer surface of soot everywhere, and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames have but one piece of character in them, which is a determination to be always dirty and always shut unless coerced. This accounts for the phenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of firewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather.|$|E
40|$|The study {{compared}} the nutrient content of selected joints of South African mutton (Class C 2) (n = 18) and lamb (Class A 2) (n = 18) carcasses of fat code 2 in both classes. South African sheep carcasses are classified according to age by dentition: Lamb carcasses of class A 2 show the ruction of no incisors and mutton carcasses of class C 2 {{of more than}} six incisors. Fatness is assessed by the thickness of subcutaneous fat. Chilled carcass sides were subdivided into the primal cuts. The cuts were dissected into meat (muscle, intermuscular and intramuscular fat), bone and subcutaneous fat (SCF). The soft tissue of the carcass was analysed for selected nutrients. It was found that South African lamb and <b>mutton</b> contain less <b>fat</b> than the nutrient values previously assumed as scientifically correct and presented in the National Food Composition Tables of the Medical Research Council (MRC), USDA. The {{results from this study}} emphasize the importance of country specific nutrient data on own food commodities. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In Charles Dickensâ€™s 'Bleak House' {{there is}} a strange (and disgusting) pattern of {{characters}} feeling that they can â€˜tasteâ€™ the air, and that that air tastes either meaty or greasy. Esther notices that snuffing â€˜two great office candles in tin candlesticksâ€™ at Mrs Jellybyâ€™s â€˜made the room taste strongly of hot tallowâ€™, the <b>mutton</b> or beef <b>fat</b> out of which inexpensive candles were made. In 'Bleak House', candles retain their sheepy atmospheres and release them into the surrounding air when consumed. Mrs Jellybyâ€™s home and Mr Vholesâ€™s office are just two places in which Dickens suggests {{that the process of}} turning organic animal bodies into urban commodities (candles, parchment, wigs) has not quite been completed. Candles and parchment are part animal, part object, and they constantly threaten to revert back into their animal forms. The commodification of animal bodies occurs primarily in the city, where parts of formerly living bodies are manufactured into things. Filled with the smell of burning chops or a spontaneously combusted human, Dickensâ€™s greasier atmospheres contain animal matter suspended in the air that the characters smell, taste, and touch. Once we realize that the apparent smell of chops and candles is, in fact, Krookâ€™s body, this act of taking the air becomes a form of cannibalism that is at least as unsettling as Michael Pollanâ€™s recent account of cows being fed cow parts in factory farms. Drawing on this insight and on Allen MacDuffieâ€™s analyses of energy systems in 'Bleak House', this article focuses on instances in which Dickens defamiliarizes the human consumption of energy by having his characters unintentionally ingest animal particles. Studying Dickensâ€™s treatment of animal fat suspended in air adds a new dimension to recent work on systems of energy expenditure and exchange in an age of industrial capitalism...|$|R
