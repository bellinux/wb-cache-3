40|$|Introduction: There are {{now more}} than 400 {{community}} type public drinking water systems in Utah. Considerable state and federal assistance is available for construction or renovation of such systems, but once the system is constructed and the consulting engineer leaves, the managers of the smaller systems find themselves quite isolated from sources of professional assistance. The larger systems have a revenue base which can provide ongoing services of a consultant or salaried engineer and well trained operators. The smaller systems, particularly low density rural systems where the length of pipeline per user is very high, usually find themselves barely able to pay loan service and operating costs despite user fees which are extremely high relative to urban systems. Typically, after construction of a new rural system, a part time operator with little or no training is hired at a very low wage and is supervised by community leaders who receive almost no pay and whose experience in managing domestic water systems often <b>matches</b> their <b>salary.</b> Such systems officers are usually very dedicated community minded people who spend countless hours at their assignment and do surprising well at keeping system costs to a minimum, but who often get replaced at frequent elections, just as they are gaining experience in their positions. Perhaps even more importantly, operators have a high turnover rate due to the low pay and high level of responsibility...|$|R

40|$|M. Phil. (Leadership in Performance and Change) Employee {{turnover}} is {{a challenge}} to all organisations, regardless of their size, industry or location. High employee turnover rates have been linked to factors such as high labour mobility due to international competition for talent, an organisation’s inability to <b>match</b> high <b>salary</b> offers from competitors, as well as employee dissatisfaction with management style. These factors are also likely to be at play within State-Owned Enterprises. Based on this background, this study aimed to investigate whether a relationship exists between management style and employee turnover intention at a South African State-Owned Enterprise. In order to meet this aim a quantitative survey was conducted. The survey consisted of a web-based questionnaire that included the T-P Leadership Questionnaire (measuring autocratic and laissez-faire management styles) and the Turnover Intention Scale (measuring employee’s intention to leave the organisation). The sample consisted of 378 respondents. The data was analysed using Product Moment Correlation and Multiple Regression analyses. The results indicate a significant positive, but low, relationship between autocratic management style and high turnover intention (r =. 19; p <. 01). The relationship between laissez-faire management style and employee turnover intention was also significantly positive correlation of r =. 29 (p <. 01). Autocratic and laissez-faire management styles explained 9. 0 % of variance in turnover intention (R 2 = 0. 09, F = 18. 70, p < 0. 0005). Human resources practitioners and line management should consider the relationship between management style and employee turnover when developing retention strategies. It is further recommended that the specific State-Owned Enterprise involved in this study should consider the reasons why employees leave, together with reasons why employees remain with the organisation when developing talent retention strategies. Such an approach could proactively address employee retention...|$|R
