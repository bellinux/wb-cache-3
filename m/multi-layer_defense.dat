40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{tactical}} defense infrastructure for mission survivability based on three core inspirations from biological sys-tems: multi-potentiation, feedback mechanisms, and redundancy. In tac-tical operational environments, these concepts may be realized {{through a combination of}} capabilities that include (1) dynamic allocation of re-sources for mission execution, (2) detection and identification of attacks and their effects, and (3) information sharing for system adaptation. As a proof-of-concept we introduce an extensible, <b>multi-layer</b> <b>defense</b> in-frastructure inspired in the self-organization and resilience properties of biological systems. Two defense strategies are considered to validate the proposed model: a fast response consisting on rebooting a compromised system from a reference system image; and a slower response involving a process of identification of the attack, which then allows the node to change its base configuration and reboot to a state that is potentially immune to the same attack. Our experimental results show that the sec-ond strategy improves the overall resilience of the system for ongoing attacks after an initial exposure phase...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} on the issue of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), which use malware for the purpose of leaking the data of large {{corporations}} and government agencies. APT attacks target systems continuously by utilizing intelligent and complex technologies. To overthrow the elaborate security network of target systems, it conducts an attack after undergoing a pre-reconnaissance phase. An APT attack causes financial loss, information leakage, etc. They can easily bypass the antivirus system of a target system. In this paper, we propose a <b>Multi-Layer</b> <b>Defense</b> System (MLDS) that can defend against APT. This system applies a reinforced defense system by collecting and analyzing log information and various information from devices, by installing the agent on the network appliance, server and end-user. It also discusses how to detect an APT attack when one cannot block the initial intrusion while continuing to conduct other activities. Thus, this system is able to minimize the possibility of initial intrusion and damages of the system by promptly responding through rapid detection of an attack when the target system is attacked...|$|E

50|$|Encryption {{solutions}} will encrypt {{the code}} instructions and typically use a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> mechanism against any reversing or tampering attempts that target the decryption code directly. Most protection systems {{in this category}} encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application’s startup or during runtime. This is the moment at which an attacker will breakpoint, reverse, and inject custom code. Runtime decryption may also add significant processing overhead and lower the game's framerate. Alternatively, some solutions focus on obfuscating the code by inserting jump statements and seemingly random instruction paths. The final and strongest alternative is virtualization. In this approach the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that can be markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set can be unique for each protected file.|$|R

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track V: BiomassLike other organisms, {{plants are}} continuously exposed to potential pathogens. Yet most plants {{are resistant to}} most pathogens because of <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defenses.</b> The most potent forms of plant defenses are triggered when the plant perceives pathogen-derived molecules. This innate immune system is a very valuable trait: when harnessed for agriculture, the innate ability of plants to resist pathogens lessens the need for energetically and environmentally costly pesticides. However, these strong inducible defenses also {{have the potential to}} adversely affect the plant if not properly kept in check. Plants with constitutively activated defenses display a severe reduction in biomass and viability. Using complementary biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches, my lab is studying the machinery that positively or negatively controls the activation of pathogen defenses in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A proper balance between plant immune system activation and suppression will maximize biomass production. Principles worked out with Arabidopsis are very relevant for crop plants. The Arabidopsis genes we are studying are conserved throughout the plant kingdom. Currently we are applying our knowledge of the plant immune system gained with Arabidopsis to grapevine.

40|$|Human {{error in}} {{computer}} systems has {{been blamed for}} many military and civilian catastrophes resulting in mission failure and loss of money and lives. However, {{the root cause of}} such failures often lies in the system’s design. A central theme in designing for human-error tolerance is to build a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense.</b> Creating such a robust system requires that designers effectively manage several aspects of erroneous system usage: prevention, reduction, detection, identification, recovery, and mitigation. These also correspond to discrete stages before and after error occurrence where different defensive measures can be taken. Human error models can be used to better understand these stages, the underlying cognitive mechanisms responsible for errors, and ultimately how to design systems and training to reduce the effects of inherent human limitations. This paper presents a general framework for human error recovery based on five key stages of erroneous performance: the commission of an error, its detection, identification, and correction, and resumption of the original task. These stages constitute the main components of a state model that characterizes human performance, and allows designers and trainers comprehensively address the most important aspects of error-tolerant design. Furthermore, these performance stages can be modeled computationally, to varying degrees, using standard information processing architectures.

40|$|Arabidopsis chloroplasts have a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> against {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2) {{that includes a}} stromal and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase (sAPX and tAPX). Single and double null mutants in SAPX and TAPX (sapx and tapx) were each crossed with ascorbate deficient vtc 2. The single, double and triple mutants did not show visual light stress phenotypes when grown at control or high light intensities (CL and HL; 120 and 1, 000 mu mol photons m(- 2) S- 1). Upon shift from CL to HL, mesophyll of expanded leaves of the triple mutant bleached within hours, with exclusion of the major vein areas; this contrasts to reported patterns of cell death under ozone treatment and calatase deficiency. tapx-vtc 2 and sapx-vtc 2, but not tapx-sapx or single mutants, showed limited bleaching. Bleaching and necrosis were accompanied by accumulation of H 2 O 2. Cellular concentrations of a-tocopherol, ascorbate and glutathione showed dramatic increase in response to HL in all eight genotypes and the four vtc 2 genotypes accumulated more glutathione under CL than the others. Transcript analysis of other ROS responsive genes in vtc 2 and the triple mutant showed up to 20 -fold induction after transition to HL, generally irrespective of genotype. We conclude that chloroplast APX proteins in Arabidopsis can be effectively compensated by other endogenous H 2 O 2 detoxification systems, but that low cellular ascorbate levels in absence of chloroplast APX activity are detrimental to the cell during excess light...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} complex {{regulatory}} mechanisms {{to control a}} <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> response to microbial attack. Both temporal and spatial gene expression are tightly regulated in response to pathogen ingress, modulating {{both positive and negative}} control of defense. BLUFENSINs, small knottin-like peptides in barley, wheat, and rice, are highly induced by attack from fungal pathogens, in particular, the obligate biotrophic fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), causal agent of barley powdery mildew. Previous research indicated that Blufensin 1 (Bln 1) functions as a negative regulator of basal defense mechanisms. In the current report, we show that BLN 1 and BLN 2 can both be secreted to the apoplast and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) -mediated overexpression of Bln 2 increases susceptibility of barley to Bgh. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays signify that BLN 1 and BLN 2 can interact with each other, and with calmodulin. We then used BSMV-induced gene silencing to knock down Bln 1, followed by Barley 1 GeneChip transcriptome analysis, to identify additional host genes influenced by Bln 1. Analysis of differential expression revealed a gene set enriched for those encoding proteins annotated to nuclear import and the secretory pathway, particularly Importin α 1 -b and Sec 61 γ subunits. Further functional analysis of these two affected genes showed that when silenced, they also reduced susceptibility to Bgh. Taken together, we postulate that Bln 1 is co-opted by Bgh to facilitate transport of disease-related host proteins or effectors, influencing the establishment of Bgh compatibility on its barley host...|$|R

This dissertation specifically addresses attack-resilient application layer security approaches for critical wide-area monitoring, protection, and control (WAMPAC) applications. The first component, 2 ̆ 7 Attack-Resilient State Estimation, 2 ̆ 7 addresses the vulnerability of state estimation to stealthy cyber attacks, and discusses two complementary approaches to enhance its resilience. A topology-based attack vector that bypasses bad data detection methods and causes loss of system observability is identified. To mitigate the stealthy attacks on measurements and topology, an offline attack-resilient measurement design methodology is presented. Further, an online attack-resilient anomaly detection method that utilized load forecasts, generation schedules, and synchrophasor data to detect measurement anomalies is described.

40|$|The small {{phenolic}} compound salicylic acid (SA) {{is critical for}} plant defense against {{a broad spectrum of}} pathogens. SA is also involved in <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> responses, from pathogen-associated molecular pattern triggered basal defense, resistance gene-mediated defense, to systemic acquired resistance. Recent decades have witnessed tremendous progress towards our understanding of SA-mediated signaling networks. Many genes have been identified to have direct or indirect effect on SA biosynthesis or to regulate SA accumulation. Several SA receptors have been identified and characterization of these receptors has shed light on the mechanisms of SA-mediated defense signaling, which encompass chromosomal remodeling, DNA repair, epigenetics, to transcriptional reprogramming. Molecules from plant-associated microbes have been identified, which manipulate SA levels and/or SA signaling. SA does not act alone. It engages in crosstalk with other signaling pathways, such as those mediated by other phytohormones, in an agonistic or antagonistic manner, depending on hormones and pathosystems. Besides affecting plant innate immunity, SA has also been implicated in other cellular processes, such as flowering time determination, lipid metabolism, circadian clock control, and abiotic stress responses, possibly contributing to the regulation of plant development. The multifaceted function of SA makes it critically important to further identify genes involved in SA signaling networks, understand their modes of action, and delineate interactions among the components of SA signaling networks. In addition, genetic manipulation of genes involved in SA signaling networks has also provided a promising approach to enhance disease resistance in economically important plants. This ebook collects articles in the Research Topic "Salicylic Acid Signaling Networks". For this collection we solicited reviews, perspectives, and original research articles that highlight recent exciting progress on the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying SA-mediated defense, SA-crosstalk with other pathways and how microbes impact these events...|$|R
40|$|Ticks {{are able}} to {{transmit}} tick-borne infectious agents to vertebrate hosts which cause major constraints to public and livestock health. The costs associated with mortality, relapse, treatments, and decreased production yields are economically significant. Ticks adapted to a hematophagous existence after the vertebrate hemostatic system evolved into a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> system against foreign invasion (pathogens and ectoparasites), blood loss, and immune responses. Subsequently, ticks evolved by developing an ability to suppress the vertebrate host immune system with a devastating impact particularly for exotic and crossbred cattle. Host genetics defines the immune responsiveness against ticks and tick-borne pathogens. To gain an insight into the naturally acquired resistant and susceptible cattle breed against ticks, {{studies have been conducted}} comparing the incidence of tick infestation on bovine hosts from divergent genetic backgrounds. It is well-documented that purebred and crossbred Bos taurus indicus cattle are more resistant to ticks and tick-borne pathogens compared to purebred European Bos taurus taurus cattle. Genetic studies identifying Quantitative Trait Loci markers using microsatellites and SNPs have been inconsistent with very low percentages relating phenotypic variation with tick infestation. Several skin gene expression and immunological studies have been undertaken using different breeds, different samples (peripheral blood, skin with tick feeding), infestation protocols and geographic environments. Susceptible breeds were commonly found {{to be associated with the}} increased expression of toll like receptors, MHC Class II, calcium binding proteins, and complement factors with an increased presence of neutrophils in the skin following tick feeding. Resistant breeds had higher levels of T cells present in the skin prior to tick infestation and thus seem to respond to ticks more efficiently. The skin of resistant breeds also contained higher numbers of eosinophils, mast cells and basophils with up-regulated proteases, cathepsins, keratins, collagens and extracellular matrix proteins in response to feeding ticks. Here we review immunological and molecular determinants that explore the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus-host resistance phenomenon as well as contemplating new insights and future directions to study tick resistance and susceptibility, in order to facilitate interventions for tick control...|$|R
40|$|Ascorbate (vitamin C) and {{ascorbate}} peroxidases (APXs) {{are part}} of a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> system that protects the cell from damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we investigated the combined functional significance of the soluble stromal ascorbate peroxidase (SAPX) and the thylakoid bound isoform (TAPX) in chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, an APX-like protein is present in the thylakoid lumen. We generated homology models for these three chloroplast APXs, and showed that the lumenal APX-like protein is not a bona fide ascorbate peroxidase. A null mutant in this lumenal APX behaved as wild-type under different light regimes. Single and double T-DNA-tagged null mutants in SAPX and TAPX were obtained and were each crossed with vtc 2, partially deficient in ascorbate accumulation (Conklin et al, 2000). The single mutants (sapx, vtc 2 and tapx), double mutants (sapx-vtc 2, tapx-vtc 2, and tapx-sapx), and the triple mutant (tapx-sapx-vtc 2) were all viable on soil. We determined levels of α-tocopherol, ascorbate and glutathione, as well as growth parameters, photosynthetic activity and H 2 O 2 accumulation in the mutants. All vtc 2 genotypes accumulated more glutathione, most likely to compensate for the 80 % loss of ascorbate. Anthocyanin accumulation increased under light stress conditions, but was strongly reduced in the vtc 2 background. Surprisingly, single, double and triple mutants did not show significant differences in light sensitivity when constantly grown under moderate or high light intensities. However, when mutants were shifted from moderate to high light (120 to 1000 μmol photons m- 2 sec- 1), fully expanded leaves in the triple mutant rapidly showed necrotic lesions in the mesophyll but not in the vasculature. Necrosis in the triple mutant was concomitant with accumulation of H 2 O 2 in the cell. tapx-vtc 2 and sapx-vtc 2 also showed signs of necrosis, but significantly less than the triple mutant. Importantly, tapx-sapx did not show any light stress symptoms, or H 2 O 2 accumulation upon shift to high light, suggesting that other peroxidase activities are sufficient to detoxify H 2 O 2 when cellular ascorbate concentration is not limiting...|$|R

40|$|Plants are {{resistant}} to most microbial pathogens due {{to the presence of}} an effective and <b>multi-layered</b> <b>defense</b> system. Arabidopsis ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS 1) and its interacting partners PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD 4) and SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 101 (SAG 101) constitute an important regulatory node in disease resistance. Together they are essential for basal defense against invasive biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens, programmed cell death conditioned by TIR-type NB-LRR immune receptors and accumulation of the phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA). It was previously shown that the central component EDS 1 forms molecularly and spatially distinct complexes with PAD 4 and SAG 101 in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of healthy plants. The fate of these complexes during defense responses and the relevance of their distribution were not known. The work presented here shows that no major redistribution of EDS 1 occurs at late stages of infection or in immune-deregulated backgrounds since its steady-state levels increase in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. By contrast, enrichment in nuclear EDS 1 was observed during early stages of TIR-NB-LRR mediated responses, suggesting that the nuclear pool of EDS 1 has a role in rapid signal relay to this compartment after specific pathogen recognition. Treatment of Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing EDS 1 -YFP with nuclear export inhibitors revealed that EDS 1 is able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, further suggesting a role for EDS 1 in relaying important information between both compartments. To gather information about the functional significance of EDS 1 distribution and discriminate cytosolic from nuclear functions, I examined whether manipulation of EDS 1 localization affects its functionality. Transgenic plants were generated in which a nuclear export signal (NES), the hormone binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or a nuclear localization signal (NLS) were attached to a functional EDS 1 -YFP fusion and expressed in an eds 1 null mutant background. EDS 1 nuclear exclusion through the presence of the NES or cytosolic tethering by the GR led to reduced basal, TIR-NB-LRR-mediated and systemic resistance. Conversely, allowing nuclear accumulation of EDS 1 -YFP-GR fusion protein through dexamethasone treatment enhanced resistance. Results also pointed to a role of cytosolic EDS 1 in modulating plant cell death that may relate to the balance of reactive oxygen species and SA. Strikingly, constitutive driving of EDS 1 to the nucleus by addition of an NLS results in a dose-dependent developmental reprogramming that likely reflects the need for rigorous control of nuclear EDS 1 levels. In sum, these studies point to a key nuclear activity of EDS 1 complexes in regulating plant immune responses that may link immune receptor activation to gene expression outputs...|$|R
