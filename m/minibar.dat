"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a <b>minibar.</b> Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E

40|$|Reforcetech AS {{is about}} to develop, and has just started, the {{manufacturing}} of basalt fibres for reinforcing concrete structures. Contrary to steel bars, the basalt reinforcement is non-corrosive, non-conductive, and non-magnetic. Basalt fibres can be delivered both as reinforcement bars and as fibre reinforcement, known as <b>Minibars.</b> This report evaluates the use of both basalt rods and basalt fibres in load carrying concrete beams. As {{a part of this}} report, six beams were tested; three pairs with different reinforcement setup. The first pair was lightly reinforced with three Ø 10, 1 bars as longitudinal reinforcement. The second pair was similar to the first, but with 0, 75 vol% added basalt fibres. The third, and last pair, was more heavily reinforced; seven reinforcement bars and 0, 75 vol% added basalt fibres. All beams had dimensions of 200 x 300 x 4000 mm. With this setup, the effects of basalt fibres could be examined as well as the influence of an increased reinforcement area. The test results were compared to available design rules. </p...|$|R
