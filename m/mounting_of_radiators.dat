It was manufactured to his design by the Wolseley Tool and Motorcar Company in 1914 and demonstrated in London the same year. The gyrocar was powered by a modified Wolseley C5 engine of 16 - 20 hp, with a bore of 90 mm and a stroke of 121 mm. It was <b>mounted</b> ahead <b>of</b> the <b>radiator,</b> driving the rear wheel through a conventional clutch and gear box. A transmission brake was fitted after the gearbox- there were no brakes on the wheels themselves. The weight of the vehicle was 2.75 tons and it had a very large turning radius.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>radiator</b> design has been made. The volume <b>of</b> the <b>radiator</b> using least total {{power has been}} expressed in a single formula which shows that the optimum radiator volume is independent of the shape <b>of</b> the <b>radiator</b> and which makes possible the construction of design tables that give the optimum radiator volume per 100 -horsepower heat dissipation {{as a function of}} the speed, of the altitude, and of one parameter involving characteristics of the airplane. Although, for a given set <b>of</b> conditions, the <b>radiator</b> volume using the least total power is fixed, the frontal area, or the length <b>of</b> the <b>radiator</b> needs to be separately specified in order to satisfy certain other requirement such as the ability to cool with the pressure drop available while the airplane is climbing. In order to simplify the specification for the shape <b>of</b> the <b>radiator</b> and in order to reduce the labor involved in calculating the detailed performance <b>of</b> <b>radiators,</b> generalized design curves have been developed for determining the pressure drop, the mass flow of air, and the power expended in overcoming the cooling drag <b>of</b> a <b>radiator</b> from the physical dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>radiator.</b> In addition, a table is derived from these curves, which directly gives the square root of the pressure drop required for ground cooling as a function <b>of</b> the <b>radiator</b> dimensions, <b>of</b> the heat dissipation and of the available temperature difference. Typical calculations using the tables <b>of</b> optimum <b>radiator</b> volume and the design curves are given. The jet power that can be derived from the heated air is proportional to the heat dissipation and is approximately proportional to the square of the airplane speed and to the reciprocal of the absolute temperature of the atmosphere.
