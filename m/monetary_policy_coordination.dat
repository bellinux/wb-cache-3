It {{requires}} coordination of the monetary policy {{as well as the}} fiscal policy and thus RBI is ideally suited to tackle the situation.Response: The need for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> should only arise during emergency situations. During normal times, monetary policy should not be used for allowing the Government to run huge deficits. The distinction of the goals, tools to be used and entities dealing with them will allow for greater accountability. For example: RBI {{will not be able to}} blame the huge government deficit for its inability to control inflation.A single objective for the RBI is too simplistic: The central bank has plenty of roles to play other than stabilising prices.|$|E

When {{there is no other}} distortion than financial market imperfections in the form of staggered international loan contracts, financial stability, which here constitutes eliminating the inefficient fluctuations of loan premiums, is the optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in open economies, regardless of whether <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> is possible. Yet, the optimality of inward-looking <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> requires an extra condition, in addition to those included in previous studies on the optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in open economies. To make allocations between cooperative and noncooperative <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> coincide, the exchange rate risk must be perfectly covered by the banks. Otherwise, each central bank has an additional incentive to control the nominal exchange rate to favor firms in her own country by reducing the exchange rate risk. optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination,</b> global banking, international staggered loan contracts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} international <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> in response to symmetric disturbances. The results show, as expected, that coordination is always useful to deal with monetary shocks. But coordination {{is not always the}} best response against real shocks, since the cooperative solution may be counterproductive when aggregate supply is relatively rigid. Finally, the benefits of coordination become evident under supply shocks, because cooperation minimizes the cost of applying an inappropriate economic policy. To conclude, the advantages of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> would appear clearer when monetary and supply shocks would prevail.

40|$|In Kohler (2002) we analyse {{coalition}} {{formation in}} <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> games between n countries. We find that positive spillovers {{of the coalition}} formation process and the resulting free-rider problem limit the stable coalition size: since the coalition members are bound by the union?s discipline, an outsider can successfully export inflation without fearing that the insiders will {{try to do the}} same. In this paper, based on the same model, we allow countries to join competing coalitions. The formation of a large currency bloc is not sustainable since it would impose too much discipline on all participants. However, the co-existence of several smaller currency blocs may be a second-best solution to the free-riding problem of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination...</b>|$|E
40|$|Calls for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> has {{increased}} as the intensifed macro- economic interdependence cultivates {{the conflict of}} interests between economics, especially following the current crisis. Yet the literature has not reached a con- sensus on whether <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> is welfare-improving. This thesis, taking from another perspective, assesses the real-world existence and extent of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> associated with economic interdepen- dence between the United States (US) and the Euro Area (EA), and investigates the changes of international transmission {{in the presence of}} coordination. <b>Monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> is represented by direct responses of monetary policy instruments to contemporaneous and lagged values of the real exchange rate. By using the method of indirect inference, this research also incorporates historical data into in-sample evaluation and estimation of the 'Dynamic Sto- chastic General Equilibrium'(DSGE) model. Beginning with indirect inference evaluations of a two-country DSGE model of the US and EA, it is found that models with coordination generally outperform their non-coordination counterpartindicating the existence of coordination. The real exchange rate is the essence of such improvement in the model's efficacy; and it is shown that coordination models have an excellent ability to replicate real exchange rate dynamics and volatility relative to a non-coordination model, even though it still remains a source of relatively poor performance of model. By applying an extensive indirect inference estimation, the existence of mon- etary coordination is ascertained since a partial-coordination model outstrips the non-coordination model remarkably. Both the US and EA economies exhibit moderate to high levels of monetary coordination. Such features improve the model's performance; particularly in terms of dynamics of US time series, volatil- ity of EA time series and both dynamics and volatility of the real exchange rate. Impulse responses and variance decomposition reveal substantial cross-country spillovers in contrast to the non-coordination model case. i...|$|E
40|$|In a two-country model, we {{consider}} the implications of <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for macroeconomic stabilization. We show that the optimal regime is one of <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> under flexible exchange rates. In {{the context of the}} European Community, this suggests that the desire to fix exchange rates may not be costless. In addition, we show that fiscal coordination requires a relatively high degree of flexibility in fiscal policy. This result suggests that limits on the flexibility of fiscal policies, as suggested in the Delors Report, may hinder macroeconomic stabilization.

40|$|A fixed-exchange-rate {{system is}} {{characterized}} by two pillars: <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> and foreign exchange reserves. This paper concentrates on the fluctuation of foreign exchange reserves by taking <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> as given: the sustainability of the fixed exchange rate regime is insured via a cointegration restriction {{on the path of}} money supplies. The paper considers three types of cash-in-advance models of money demand. The first two types are more traditional models where the cash-in-advance constraint is applied on the goods produced in the two countries. The third type is a model where cash is required in transactions with the government. The main finding is that when the exchange rate is credibly fixed, currencies are perfectly substitutable as stores of value although they might not be perfectly substitutable as transactions media. While the total demand for money is always determined, the composition of foreign exchange reserves might be indeterminate if currencies are held for store-of-value purposes only.

40|$|This paper empirically {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of interest-rate monetary rules for interdependent economies characterized by model uncertainty. We set out a two-bloc dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with habit persistence (that generates output persistence), Calvo pricing and wage-setting with indexing of non-optimized prices and wages (generating inflation persistence), incomplete financial markets and the incomplete pass-through of exchange rate changes. We estimate a linearized form of the model by Bayesian maximum-likelihood methods using US and Euro-zone data. From the estimates of the posterior distributions we then examine monetary policy conducted both independently and cooperatively by the Fed and the ECB {{in the form of}} robust inflation-targeting interest-rate rules. Comparing the utility outcome in a closed-loop Nash equilibrium with the outcome from a coordinated design of policy rules, we find a new result: the gains from <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> rise significantly when CPI inflation targeting interest-rate rules are designed to account for model uncertainty. <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination,</b> robustness, inflation-targeting interest-rate rules. ...|$|E

We find international negotiation of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> produces less reform than non-cooperation. Reform is lowest of all with monetary union. Because integration lowers reform, inflation is higher under monetary union than with national currencies. It may be higher or lower with negotiation than no coordination. Despite the negative impact on reform, negotiation produces higher welfare than no coordination. Monetary union can produce higher or lower welfare than either negotiation or no coordination.

40|$|Macroeconomic {{policies}} {{are meant to}} achieve non-inflationary, stable growth. There are two major groups of policy instruments to achieve the purpose; one is related to monetary conditions {{and the other to}} fiscal conditions. Monetary instruments are employed by the central bank and fiscal instruments are employed by ministry of finance. The objectives and implications of policy measures taken by the two institutions often conflict with each other and thus call for <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for effective implementation of policy decisions to achieve the set targets.

40|$|International policy {{coordination}} {{is generally}} considered to be made less likely [...] and less profitable [...] by uncertainty about how the economy works. This paper offers a counter example, in which investors' increased uncertainty about portfolio preference makes coordination more beneficial. Without such coordination, monetary authorities may respond to financial market uncertainty by not fully accommodating demands for increased liquidity, for fear of inducing exchange rate depreciation. Coordinated monetary expansion would minimize this danger. This result is formalized in a model incorporating an equity market; then, the stock market crash of October 1987 and its implications for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> are discussed. ...|$|E
