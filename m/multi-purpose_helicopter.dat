40|$|Abstract – The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic behaviour}} of a modern, <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>helicopter</b> is considered in this article. The main {{objective of this}} study is to characterize the helicopter’s vibration mechanism(s) – i. e., to determine if the vibrations are periodic or chaotic. This study involved analyses of flight data, specifically records of acceleration for two different airspeeds with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. Some background in the theory of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems is discussed, and approaches for the identification of chaos in time series data are presented. Several topics including delay-coordinate embedding theory, delay time and dimension determination, and maximal Lyapunov exponent computation for chaotic systems are described. In each section, helicopter flight data sets are examined and analyzed, and the results are compared with those for classical chaotic systems. Results for classical problems adds tutorial value as well as confirming our helicopter studies. Finally, implications regarding the possibility of chaotic behaviour in the flight data are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of thermal}} {{radiation}} for target recognition {{is a very}} effective method, since every object emits certain amounts of thermal energy that can’t be fully masked. In recent years a rapid development of IR target recognition devices can be observed. These devices are capable of detection and identification of low-flying objects at close distances. Such Infrared Search and Track Systems (IRSTs) successfully replace radar-based devices in air surveillance and weapon control applications. Effective detection of objects in infrared range can be performed when characteristic emissive parameters of objects to be detected are known. Knowledge of those parameters {{makes it possible to}} distinguish the target from other sources of thermal radiation. The set of such parameters is called the thermal signature of a target. The data required for further analysis were gathered by recording numerous thermal images of selected target in various weather conditions. The recordings were performed using thermal cameras with uncooled microbolometer focal plane arrays (7. 5 µm to 13 µm working range). The <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>helicopter</b> was chosen as a selected target to be detected. It is an object capable of lowaltitude flying at various speeds.

40|$|The {{tail rotor}} of {{conventional}} helicopters {{has always been}} considered a necessary 'evil'. It is necessary to counteract the reaction torque of the engine and to control the helicopter in yaw but it consumes substantial power, has only marginal control authority under unfavourable wind conditions, and it is noisy, vulnerable and dangerous. A solution to all these problems would be a helicopter concept that {{eliminates the need for}} a tail rotor. The so-called 'Ornicopter', a helicopter with flapping blades, is such a concept. The mechanism of the Ornicopter is inspired by bird flight. When birds flap their wings they are able to generate both a lifting force and a propelling force from this single movement. Instead of propelling a helicopter blade by spinning it around and deriving lift from this rotating movement, as is done in conventional helicopter configurations, the Ornicopter flaps its blades like a bird and derives both lift and a propulsive force from this movement. In this case the blades propel themselves and {{there is no longer a}} need for a direct torque supplied by the engine to rotate the blades. The Ornicopter's rotor, therefore, will not cause a reaction torque on the fuselage, which makes the tail rotor's anti-torque function redundant. The goal of the present thesis is to develop a thorough understanding of the Ornicopter concept and its feasibility throughout a realistic flight envelope. The first part presents the analysis of the Ornicopter's main characteristics regarding performance, stability, controllability, handling qualities, as well as an exploratory vibratory analysis. In the second part a preliminary design and sizing thereof are presented based on the conclusions obtained in the first part. The basis for the Ornicopter's study is an analytically-derived flight mechanics model. The model is based on the blade element theory (BET) and considers 6 rigid body degrees of freedom (DoF), 3 DoF blade flapping dynamics and 3 DoF Pitt-Peters inflow dynamics. Previous mathematical models developed as a proof of the Ornicopter concept have concentrated mainly on hovering flight. The model developed in this thesis is capable of representing the Ornicopter's dynamics well within its entire operational flight envelope. As a benchmark for the Ornicopter's specifications, the Bolkow Bo- 105 helicopter is used. The Bo- 105 helicopter is a light twin-engine, <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>helicopter</b> developed in Germany in the 1970 s. For the initial values of the design parameters of the Ornicopter (such as rotor radius, blade loading, rotor tip velocity, vertical fin size) the Bo- 105 helicopter design is used. A 2 X 2 anti-symmetric rotor flapping configuration (with two opposite blades flapping in the same direction) is used for the Ornicopter in order to eliminate the necessity for a tail rotor. Using these design parameters it is demonstrated that the Ornicopter rotor can generate enough propulsive torque to rotate the blades with modest flapping amplitudes (maximum less than 9 deg). The present thesis demonstrates that, compared to the Bo- 105 helicopter, the Ornicopter concept suffers from higher required power, a smaller flight envelope (mainly due to the larger rotor stall area) and lower yaw stability. All these drawbacks are attributed to the large rotor blade angle of attack variation introduced by the forced flapping mechanism and the absence of a tail rotor. In the second part of this thesis, the Ornicopter concept is optimized for performance. Keeping the performance specifications of the Bo- 105 as the objectives, the design values (blade radius, blade loading etc) are turned to fit the Ornicopter concept and no longer use the Bo- 105 design values. The design optimization is formulated through minimization of the required power, while satisfying the stall area requirement. The thesis proves that the optimal design for the Ornicopter as compared to the Bo- 105 benchmark is characterized by a lower blade loading, increased rotor tip velocity and larger vertical fin size. This optimal design results in an enlarged flight envelope due to the reduced rotor stall area and improved yaw stability in forward flight. Nevertheless, despite these improvements in the Ornicopter's flight envelope, there is a slight increase in required power when compared with the Bo- 105 specification (approximately 5 % at 150 knots). To compensate for the higher profile power needed for the Ornicopter's optimal design, a larger rotor radius is required in order to reduce the induced power and keep the increase in the total required power to a minimum. This thesis may be considered as a first step in rationalizing the expectations regarding the Ornicopter's tailless helicopter design. The thesis proved that this new concept shows a slightly poorer performance than that of conventional helicopters regarding power consumption in forward flight and service ceiling. This is disappointing since one of the assumptions was that the elimination of the tail rotor would also eliminate the power consumption associated with a tail rotor. Further analyses of the Ornicopter's performance (such as endurance, payloads, climbing performance, and environmental performance related to safety and noise), costs or maintenance should be performed for a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this helicopter concept.
