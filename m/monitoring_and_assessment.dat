In recent years, great emphasis {{has been put on}} participatory methods of natural resources management. Do they work? How can we assess that? These two crucial questions, combined with strong calls for better accountability, have led to a growing interest in participatory monitoring. A new IIED publication Participatory <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> impact <b>assessment</b> of sustainable agriculture initiatives, sponsored by the British Department for International Development (DFID), introduces, in a practical way, the concepts and key steps in setting participatory monitoring.
