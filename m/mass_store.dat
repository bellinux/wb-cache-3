After surveying existing mass storage and associated file systems, this paper presents one approach to integrating AFS with mass storage. We consider the <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> itself to be the file system, not a bag {{on the side of}} a disk-based file system. This unifying perspective distinguishes our approach from other large-scale file systems. Instead of developing a back-end server to manage the movement of data files between traditional disk-based storage systems (employed, in our case, by AFS) and magnetic-tape or optical-based mass storage systems (of which AFS has little or no knowledge), we envision the <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> as a first-class data repository. A traditional disk-based file system serves as a (very large) cache of the <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> system. On top of that is another, large, high-speed memory cache. All storage other than the <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> is used exclusively for caching. In this approach, cache management policies are of fundamental importance. Two main requirements for this work are that the AFS name space remain unchanged, and performance seen by users must not suffer. For example, users must not have to pre-stage files explicitly in order to achieve acceptable performance...|$|E

40|$|A mass-designer line is an {{exclusive}} line that a fashion designer develops {{for a specific}} mass market retailer. There are increasingly more high-end fashion designers and mass market retailers cooperating with mass line development. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate young consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and purchase intentions towards mass-designer lines within the attitude-intentions paradigm (Fishbein 2 ̆ 6 Ajzen, 1975). The aim is to understand the relationship between perceptual variables and their influence on young consumers 2 ̆ 7 decisions when they purchase mass-designer line products. An online questionnaire was developed based on relevant literature. Measures included attitude, purchase intentions, and five consumer-oriented variables (fashion involvement, price consciousness, value consciousness, past experience, and perceived <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> image). Three thousand and five hundred college female students at a major midwestern university were invited to participate in the study. An analysis of the causal model was conducted using the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure of Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) for hypotheses testing. Results showed that attitude was the most significant predictor of purchase intentions. Moreover, past experience with designers was also a significant predictor of purchase intentions. The results also revealed that perceived <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> images significantly influenced young consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes, however, no significant relationship was found between perceived <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> image and purchase intentions. By testing the role of attitude as a mediating variable, it was determined that past experience with designers exert influence indirectly through attitudes on purchase intentions towards mass-designer lines. Based on these findings, theoretical and practical implications are provided...|$|E

40|$|Delayed {{write in}} a {{multilevel}} file system cache hierarchy offers a way to improve performance in diverse client/server scenarios, such as integrating <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> into a distributed file system or providing distributed file system access over low-speed links. Using file system traces and cache simulations, we explore extensions and modifications to the traditional client caching model employed in such file systems as AFS, Sprite, and DFS. High cache hit rates at an intermediate cache server—a machine logically interposed between clients and servers that provides cached file service to the clients—combined with high client cache hit rates lend practicality to an integrated mass storage file system. In such a system, magnetic tape or optical-based mass storage devices {{may be used as}} a first-class data repository, fronted by disk and RAM caches to offer acceptable access times to the large, but slow, mass storage system. Similarly, a high cache hit rate is necessary for users accessing file systems via low-speed links, where a delayed write intermediate caching server can mediate traffic to make better use of available bandwidth. In an example taken from mobile computing, an intermediate server might be used as a docking station at a user’s home. This arrangement would be convenient for users of mobile computers who upload large amounts of data generated while operating in disconnected mode. Simulations of delayed write caching strategies are applicable to both the mass storage and low-speed link scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} large volume data storage systems will depend {{not only on}} the ability of the designers to store data, but on the ability to manage such data once it is in the system. The hypothesis is that mass storage data management can only be implemented successfully based on highly intelligent meta data management services. There now exists a proposed <b>mass</b> <b>store</b> system standard proposed by the IEEE that addresses many of the issues related to the storage of large volumes of data, however, the model does not consider a major technical issue, namely the high level management of stored data. However, if the model were expanded to include the semantics and pragmatics of the data domain using a Semantic Data Model (SDM) concept, the result would be data that is expressive of the Intelligent Information Fusion (IIF) concept and also organized and classified in context to its use and purpose. The results are presented of a demonstration prototype SDM implemented using the expert system development tool NEXPERT OBJECT. In the prototype, a simple instance of a SDM was created to support a hypothetical application for the Earth Observing System, Data Information System (EOSDIS). The massive amounts of data that EOSDIS will manage requires the definition and design of a powerful information management system in order to support even the most basic needs of the project. The application domain is characterized by a semantic like network that represents the data content and the relationships between the data based on user views and the more generalized domain architectural view of the information world. The data in the domain are represented by objects that define classes, types and instances of the data. In addition, data properties are selectively inherited between parent and daughter relationships in the domain. Based on the SDM a simple information system design is developed from the low level data storage media, through record management and meta data management to the user interface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper briefly {{presents}} {{the main features}} of a hydro-mechanical coupled finite element of interface. The mechanical problems {{takes into account the}} the detection of contact, the development of a contact pressure, the shearing and the relative sliding between two solids. A three-node discretisation of hydraulic problem allows the represen-tation of fluid flows across and in the plane of the interface. The method involves a drop of pressure between each side of the interface and the inner medium. The hydro-mechanical couplings come from 1) the definition of the total pressure acting {{on each side of the}} interface according to the Terzaghi’s principle; 2) the dependence of the permeability on the gap variation; 3) the variation of the fluid <b>mass</b> <b>stored</b> within the gap. ...|$|R

We determine the amount of <b>mass</b> <b>stored</b> in the disk until the triggering of the outburst and the recurrence time. The evaporation of matter from the inner accretion disk to a coronal flow is an essential feature of the disk evolution and depends on the black hole mass. For accretion rates slightly lower than those in the known black hole X-ray transients the disk would be stationary, the systems would persistently remain in a cool state. (orig.)
