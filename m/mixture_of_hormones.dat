Conditions for optimum survival of the hepatocyte and for synthesis of these plasma proteins were defined for this system. These conditions included the use of horse serum (17. 5 percent, v/v, heat-inactivated), an enriched medium (Waymouth's MB 752 / 1), an O 2 tension of between 18. 7 times 10 (3) and 26. 7 times 10 (3) Pa and constant stirring. Albumin, fibrinogen and transferrin synthesis rates were obtained of 0. 32 p 0. 094 (10), 0. 12 p 0. 030 (11) and 0. 097 p 0. 017 (10) [mean p S. D. (n) ]mg/h per g of hepatocytes respectively. These rates were maintained for the first 12 h of study and synthesis continued at a diminished rate up to 48 h. The synthesis of albumin was decreased in a medium containing less amino acids and glucose, but that of fibrinogen was substantially unaffected. ATP concentrations up to 12 h and RNA/DNA ratios up to 24 h were comparable with values in vivo.

40|$|MCF- 10 A, a nontransformed mammary {{epithelial}} cell line, requires a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> and growth factors for optimal cell proliferation. In this report {{we show that}} when MCF- 10 A cells are cultured in serum free medium they become quiescent and accumulate in G 0 /G 1 phases of the cell cycle. Following addition of complete medium to quiescent cells, MCF- 10 A cells enter into the S phase within 15 - 18 h and resume the cell cycle distribution of proliferating cells within 24 h. Measurement of RI alpha subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) shows a 10 - to 15 -fold increase in protein levels at 6 h following complete medium addition, thus preceding cell entry into the S phase. Retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of RI alpha, but not of RII beta or C alpha subunits of PKA, enables MCF- 10 A cells to grow in serum-free medium. In addition, RI alpha downregulation by specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment or following infection with a retroviral vector containing the RI alpha cDNA in antisense orientation determines growth arrest of proliferating MCF- 10 A cells {{and is able to}} partially block S phase entry of quiescent MCF- 10 A cells following complete medium addition. These results suggest that RI alpha/PKAI is involved in the control of cell cycle progression of mammary {{epithelial cell}}s at a G 1 to S transition border, and that its overexpression is able to overcome serum and growth factors requirement for cell proliferation...|$|E

In this study, native rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) and introduced invasive (but prevalent) mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) {{were exposed to the}} individual compounds atrazine, estrone, bisphenol A, propylparaben and pyrimethanil, and mixtures of compounds including hormones and personal care products, industrial compounds, and pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations. Vitellogenin (Vtg) protein and liver Vtg mRNA induction were used to assess the estrogenic potential of these compounds. Vtg expression was significantly affected in both species exposed to estrone at concentrations that leave little margin for safety (p &lt; 0. 001). Propylparaben caused a small but statistically significant 3 × increase in Vtg protein levels (p = 0. 035) in rainbowfish but at a concentration 40 × higher than that measured in the environment, therefore propylparaben poses a low risk of inducing endocrine disruption in fish. Mixtures of pesticides and a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones,</b> pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides induced a small but statistically significant increase in plasma Vtg in rainbowfish, but did not affect mosquitofish Vtg protein or mRNA expression.

40|$|SUMMARY. -BR 6 female mice {{treated with}} a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones,</b> {{developed}} mammary tumours earlier than untreated virgin animals. Implantation of ectopic pituitaries also increased tumour incidence and reduced {{the age at which}} tumours first appeared. This effect was obtained {{even in the absence of}} ovaries. Neither hormone treatment nor ectopic pituitaries succeeded in producing tumours as early as they appear in breeding females. THE BR 6 strain of mice resulted from a cross between a C 57 Black female and an RIII male (Foulds, 1947, 1949) and all mice carry a mammary tumour virus derived from the latter. Mammary tumour incidence in breeding females is 94 % and most tumours first appear during a pregnancy at about 26 weeks of age (Mundy and Williams, 1961). These tumours are at first pregnancy-dependent, though later they may grow independently. In virgin mice the tumour incidence is 48 % and tumours seldom appear before the mice are 12 months old. Although it seems that the hormones of early pregnancy may be sufficient to stimulate the growth of existing (but regressed) tumours (Lee, 1970) the hormones present in later stages of pregnancy are necessary for the development of new tumours. In the first group of experiments described here it was hoped to simulate the effects of pregnancy by the administration of hormones. In the second group the endocrine status of the mouse was permanently altered by the implantation of isologous pituitaries at sites remote from hypothalamic control. As prolactin secretion is controlled by prolactin inhibiting factor from the hypothalamus, a pituitary removed from this control secretes prolactin unchecked (Muhlbock and Boot, 1959) whilst the host's own pituitary is controlled in the normal way. In some experiments pituitary implantation was combined with exogenous hormones, or with ovariectomy...|$|E

30|$|The {{fabricated}} neurotransmitter sensor {{was connected}} to a potentiostat (Reference 600, Gamry Instruments) and test data was monitored using a labview-based data recording system (VFP 600). The electrochemical cell was filled with target catecholamine hormone solution, and the fabricated sensor was tested in random <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> catecholamine <b>hormone</b> targets (L-tyrosine, L-DOPA, and DA), concentrations (5  μM- 10  mM), and scan rate (1 - 100  mV/s). First, I-V curves of each electrode were measured in a specific neurotransmitter concentration to measure the individual responses of each CDs immobilized electrode. Next, by varying the neurotransmitter concentrations between 5  μM- 10  mM at every decade, the response curves were constructed for each CD electrode and neurotransmitter. The slope of the curve provides the sensitivity of each electrode to each neurotransmitter. Then, from the collected sensitivity coefficients, the matrix of quantification was constructed to identify the individual concentrations from a mixture. Finally, the individual concentrations were extracted from random <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> L-tyrosine, L-DOPA and dopamine and compared to the original values, in order to validate the developed sensor and method. Measurement was repeated at least five times, and all the catecholamine hormones were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA.|$|R
40|$|Although anecdotally sex {{differences}} {{and the impact}} they may have on cognition is a hot topic in the media, and indeed in research, very little consensus has been found for hormone-related changes in behaviour. Previous {{work in this area}} tends to use a two-time repeated measures method to investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> across the menstrual cycle. However this method {{has been shown to be}} relatively ineffective. The female menstrual cycle is roughly 28 days long with very a dynamic, and rapidly changing, <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations across the cycle. To capture this fully we suggest it is necessary to collect data at a significantly greater number of time points with more rigorous methods and suitably sensitive analysis. Four studies are presented in this thesis which focus on capturing more accurately the effect <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> on cognition across the menstrual cycle. Studies One – Three present data from 13 participants using the standard two-time repeated measure method to investigate categorisation behaviour. This is a completely novel area of research in terms <b>of</b> cognition and <b>hormones.</b> Previous research has focused on various aspects of cognition, yet despite categorisation behaviour being a clearly distinct area of cognition, research into the impact <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> changes has neglected to look for differences here. The focus on categorisation behaviour provides us with a more holistic picture of the impact <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> on performances and cognition. Study Four provided a novel approach to the way in which studies are conducted in the area. Here we present a multiple repeated measures study with data from 22 participants using a figural comparison task with measurements at twelve time points across their cycles. A previous study by Hausmann et al,. (2002) using a figural comparison task showed clear impact of the menstrual cycle on cognitive performance using 15 time-point measurements in a sample of 12 participants. In addition to an increase in measurement sensitivity using more time points, we also developed a novel mathematical approach to model the performance change over the menstrual cycle. From Studies One to Three we determined that categorisation performance does not appear to be influenced by changes in cyclical hormone changes. However we did find an influence of hormonal changes on performance in a 1 -dimensional categorisation task which demonstrates that hormones may have an impact upon Rule-based categorisation. From Study 4 we were unable to replicate Hausmann and colleagues findings. However we were able to successfully develop a novel modelling method that could accurately predict participant performance on a figural comparison task across the menstrual cycle. Overall this thesis presents a comprehensive investigation into hormone related changes in cognition across the menstrual cycle. We looked into a novel area of behavioural categorisation to determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> related changes in performance on such a task. Through which we demonstrated that in this one area there is little impact despite most other areas of cognition being influenced by cyclical hormonal changes. We then investigated the methodology used in the field in an attempt to improve and develop more accurate and sensitive measures. We were unable to replicate a previous study using multiple time points, however the success of developing a model to predict performance on the figural comparison task provides a useful tool for researchers in the area in the future. The thesis clearly demonstrates that this is an area in the field of psychology and neurobiology that is still in need of further investigation and that we still have much to understand in terms of the ways in which our hormones can impact our behaviour...|$|R

To 3 -day-old primary rabbit baby kidney tissue cultures a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> 20 μg of norethynodrel per ml [17 α-ethynyl-hydroxy- 5 (10) -estren- 3 -one] and 5 μg of mestranol per ml (17 -ethynelestradiol- 3 -methyl ether) was added; growth of tissue cultures in Eagle medium was continued till the sixth day, and then one tissue cytopathic dose of alpha toxin per ml was added and the subsequent fate of tissue cultures was assayed. Such cultures yielded higher total and viable cell counts, utilized more glucose, and contained more protein than the control cultures. In control cultures, cytopathogenicity appeared on the third day after the addition of alpha toxin, and it was complete in 24 hr, whereas in tissue cultures treated with Enovid cytopathogenicity was significantly reduced.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{evaluation and}} a thorough {{discussion of the}} fields of possible applications of the Direct-EI interface are described in this review. Direct-EI allows the direct introduction of the effluent from a capillary HPLC column into the electron ionization (EI) ion source of a mass spectrometer. Thanks to the reduced liquid intake and an in-source nebulizer, the interfacing process occurs smoothly and entirely into the ion source. No intermediate interfacing mechanisms of any sort are interposed between the column and the mass spectrometer, thus circumventing any undesired sample loss and minimizing the effort for instrument modification. Theoretically, any GC-MS system can be converted into an LC-MS for EI amenable compounds. Several parameters, crucial for a successful integration of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, have been considered {{in the evaluation of}} the functioning of such an interface: limit of detection, linearity of response, reproducibility, and chromatographic compatibility. Different mobile phases, also containing non-volatile buffers, were taken into account, demonstrating an outstanding separation flexibility. The entire set of experiments was carried out at different flow rates and temperatures of the ion source. The interface behavior was also tested in real world applications, with <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> pesticides, <b>hormones,</b> nitro-PAH, and endocrine-disrupting compounds, allowing picogram level detection and the possibility to record library-matchable, readily interpretable electron ionization mass spectra, for prompt compound characterization and confirmation...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics profiles of several medications. Results from previous studies have suggested that physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, including increased plasma concentrations <b>of</b> female <b>hormones</b> may {{play an important role in}} the observed changes in drug metabolism. Despite this general awareness, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of major drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) during pregnancy remain unknown. The aim of this dissertation was to characterize the impact <b>of</b> pregnancy related <b>hormones</b> on hepatic CYPs, UGTs and transporters. The effect <b>of</b> female <b>hormones</b> on the expression and activity of selected CYP, UGT, and transporters was measured in four independent studies in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. A <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> female <b>hormones</b> at projected hepatic concentrations in the third trimester of pregnancy significantly increased mRNA expression, activity, and protein expression of CYP 3 A 4 but limited impact on other CYPs. Female hormones however, differentially altered the expression and activity of various UGT enzymes. Progesterone and estradiol increased the activities of UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 4, respectively. Conversely, human chorionic gonadotropin decreased the activity of UGT 1 A 4. A significant increase in the expression of UGT 1 A 6 and UGT 1 A 9 was observed by progesterone compared to the control. Human growth hormone enhanced the mRNA expression of UGT 2 B 7. Expression of UGT 1 A 1, UGT 1 A 3 and AhR were significantly increased by estradiol. Progesterone significantly increased the expression of BCRP. Estradiol also enhanced the expression of NHERF 1. Together, these findings provide support for the role <b>of</b> female <b>hormones</b> in the altered specific drug metabolism and transport during pregnancy. Using physiological based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) modeling, we predicted that pregnancy will increase the clearance of buprenorphine (a drug that is simultaneously metabolized by CYP and UGT). This was supported by preliminary clinical observations. However, female hormones did not have any significant impact on the metabolism of buprenorphine in primary cultures of human hepatocytes, implicating additional factors to be responsible for pregnancy-mediated changes in pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine. In conclusion, our findings indicate that pregnancy related hormones contribute to some of the observed changes in drug metabolism and transport during pregnancy...|$|R

Lactoferrin has a remarkable antibacterial effect and {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of immune response. In a previous study, a full-length cDNA of 2133 bp from Macaca cyclopis lactoferrin gene (mLF) was cloned and sequenced. An effective promoter that can specifically drive the egg genes is necessary to establish a transgenic chicken line that can overexpress mLF in its eggs in addition to the viral promoters under development. Conalbumin and ovalbumin are the major proteins in egg white. The promoter regions of these two genes were cloned from the chromosomes of white Leghorn chicken in this study. This study uses fluorescence and luciferase assays to test the activities and tissue specificity of these two genes in primary cell cultures of white Leghorn chicken. The results show that the two promoters did not function in chicken muscle cells and fibroblast cells.

In view of the selective high-affinity binding <b>of</b> steroid <b>hormones</b> to GST 4 - 4, this protein has the potential to function in transport, metabolism and perhaps even in the action <b>of</b> steroid <b>hormones...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigher {{plants are}} exposed to natural {{environmental}} organic chemicals, associated with plant-environment interactions, and xenobiotic environmental organic chemicals, associated with anthropogenic activities. The effects of these chemicals result not only from interaction with metabolic targets, but also from interaction with the complex regulatory networks <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> signaling. Purpose-designed plant hormone analogues thus show extensive signaling effects on gene regulation and are as such important for understanding plant hormone mechanisms and for manipulating plant growth and development. Some natural environmental chemicals also act on plants through interference with the perception and transduction <b>of</b> endogenous <b>hormone</b> signals. In a number of cases, bioactive xenobiotics, including herbicides that {{have been designed to}} affect specific metabolic targets, show extensive gene regulation effects, which are more in accordance with signaling effects than with consequences of metabolic effects. Some of these effects could be due to structural analogies with plant hormones or to interference with hormone metabolism, thus resulting in situations <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> disruption similar to animal cell endocrine disruption by xenobiotics. These hormone-disrupting effects can be superimposed on parallel metabolic effects, thus indicating that toxicological characterisation of xenobiotics must take into consideration the whole range of signaling and metabolic effects. Hormone-disruptive signaling effects probably predominate when xenobiotic concentrations are low, as occurs in situations of residual low-level pollutions. These hormone-disruptive effects in plants may thus be of importance for understanding cryptic effects of low-dosage xenobiotics, as well as the interactive effects <b>of</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> xenobiotic pollutants...|$|R

The optimum conditions for obtaining many isolated liver cells with high viability were an enzyme concentration of 2000 U/ml, a pH of 7. 5 and a perfusion time of 20 min. The population of isolated liver cells prepared with dispase consisted of 43. 6 % cells with diameters less than 20 micron and 56. 4 % cells with diameters above 20 micron. The isolated liver {{cells were cultured in}} basal culture medium either supplemented with or without dexamethasone (1 X 10 (- 5) M) and insulin (10 micrograms/ml). The addition <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> to the culture medium improved the attachment efficiency of the isolated liver cells and delayed the disappearance of mature hepatocytes. Epithelial-like clear cells proliferated early in primary culture even in the presence <b>of</b> <b>hormones.</b> Therefore, functioning mature hepatocytes and proliferating epithelial-like clear cells coexisted well in the hormone-containing medium. Furthermore, the number of cultured cells reached a maximal level earlier in the presence <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> than in the absence <b>of</b> <b>hormones.</b> The level <b>of</b> TAT activity in primary cultured cells was higher up to 3 days after inoculation in the presence <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> than in their absence.
