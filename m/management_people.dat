5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was the 18th overall LP Charles had recorded. According to him, {{the title}} of the album was {{conceived}} by producer Sid Feller and ABC-Paramount's executives and <b>management</b> <b>people.</b> The recording sessions for the album took place at three sessions in mid-February 1962. The first two sessions were set on February 5 and 7 at Capitol Studios in New York, New York, at which one half of the album was recorded and produced. The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Instead of drawing what he should record from memory and his knowledge of country music, Charles asked Feller, his newly appointed A (Artists and Repertoire) man, to research top country standards through major country music publishers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT“I {{came from}} there (but no one warned me!) ”: {{reflections}} on <b>people</b> <b>management</b> policies that target intranational interculturalityThe {{purpose of this}} article is to analyze how professionals who decided to risk intramobility in their careers and who were hired by organizations from the industrial complex of Camaçari (Bahia) perceive the development of <b>people</b> <b>management</b> strategies that target intranational interculturality within these organizations. To achieve this, besides a review and theoretical analysis of the concepts of mobility, intercultural <b>management</b> and <b>people</b> <b>management</b> in organizations, 13 professionals were interviewed who had moved from different Brazilian states to work in companies in this particular complex. The results indicate that generally organizations ignore intercultural aspects, which is reflected in a gap in <b>people</b> <b>management</b> strategies. One indication of this refers to the lack of initial support, which generates problems for the individuals who arrive with great expectations in their new workplace. Furthermore, there is evidence that the financial help provided is insufficient and it becomes necessary to pay attention also to subjective aspects that involve relocation and the consequent international interculturality. Finally, it is believed that expansion of the focus of studies on intercultural management, with a look at intranational aspects, makes it possible to learn theoretical and practical lessons because of the experiences of the players who underwent the process, since intercultural <b>management</b> and <b>people</b> <b>management</b> can generate comparative advantages for organizations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of <b>people</b> <b>management</b> practices on the outcomes of organisational change projects through their contributions to organisational learning. The contributions to their outcomes of particular corporate and project-specific <b>people</b> <b>management</b> practices are considered. Method: Case studies of two organisational change projects undertaken by Arts Council England during 2006 - 07 are used to examine how far and in what ways <b>people</b> <b>management</b> practices influence the outcomes of such projects. Organisational change is considered as an instance of organisational learning, {{which in turn is}} examined in relation to the twin activities of developing new ideas and internal sense-making. Findings: Evidence is presented that certain <b>people</b> <b>management</b> practices, individually and in combination, influence the outcomes of organisational change projects significantly through their contributions to organisational learning. Research implications: Research into {{the influence of}} particular <b>people</b> <b>management</b> practices, and the contexts and processes through which it is exerted, is necessary to develop more generalisable conclusions. This influence is liable to be invisible to less granular research into <b>people</b> <b>management</b> as a general construct. Originality/value: Research into the use of project management methods specifically to implement organisational change is sparse. The findings of this article contradict findings from research into the influence of <b>people</b> <b>management</b> on project outcomes in general, which suggest that it does not have a significant effect...|$|R
