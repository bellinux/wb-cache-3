40|$|Polar Regions are {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} world areas to any climate change, and therefore can be considered drivers of global climate change, so small and systematic changes in the Polar Regions affect critically the global environment. This is particularly worrying for Europe and the Arctic due to ocean circulation interaction between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Oceans whose outcome is already producing significant climate anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere. Many European countries support polar research, {{not only in the}} Arctic but also in Antarctica, and in fact many European polar research programs have a two-pole perspective.

40|$|Future {{scientific}} {{breakthroughs in}} <b>marine</b> <b>polar</b> <b>research</b> critically depend on {{our ability to}} perform field expeditions with state-of-the-art technologies and modern infrastructures. This will require major investments, {{both in terms of}} generating new, as well as maintaining and renovating existing infrastructure. Diverse novel tools are presently projected, also within the context of scientific needs after the IPY has ended. We here report on the planning of a new European research icebreaker, the AURORA BOREALIS, with an all-season capability of endurance in permanently ice-covered waters and with the possibility to carry out deep-sea drilling in ice-covered deep-sea basins. AURORA BOREALIS will be the most advanced polar research vessel in the world with a multi-functional role of drilling in deep ocean basins and supporting climate and environmental research and decision support for stakeholder governments within the next 35 - 40 years. The vessel will be a powerful research icebreaker with more than 45, 000 tons displacement and an estimated length of 185 m, with about 55 Megawatt propulsion power. New technological features to be implemented include a novel hull design and specialized dynamic positioning systems for operations under closed sea-ice cover conditions with up to 2. 5 m ice thickness, combined with advanced satellite navigation and ice-forecasting support. Two moon-pools (7 x 7 m each) will allow routine deployment and operation of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) in ice conditions. A dedicated deep-sea drilling rig with full weather protection will enable sampling of the ocean floor in water depths down to 5000 m with 1000 m penetration under polar conditions. The modular arrangement of science space with hangars, the possibility to flexibly equip the ship with laboratory or supply containers and with helicopters, addresses the needs of diverse disciplines in marine research. We report on the current status of the technical design, the scientific outline and the framework of the Preparatory Phase recently started {{within the context of a}} European collaborative project, the European Research Icebreaker Consortium - AURORA BOREALIS...|$|E

5000|$|The German-Russian Year's slogan [...] "Partnership of Ideas" [...] was {{the motto}} of more than 200 events held between May 2011 and May 2012. Priority areas {{included}} basic {{research in the field}} of physics, optical technologies, <b>marine</b> and <b>polar</b> <b>research,</b> information and communication technologies, biological research and biotechnology. A German-Russian collaboration in the area of vocational education and training (VET) led to the establishment of bilateral VET partnerships, and thanks to joint innovation partnerships research results were translated more efficiently into ready-for-market products. Special emphasis was given to the support of young talent: the qualifications of young scientists in both countries were enhanced through German-Russian exchange programmes and partnerships between institutions of higher education. Eighteen select German universities hosted [...] "Russia Weeks" [...] to raise awareness among students, scientists and the general public of the potential of German-Russian cooperation in the higher education sector. German and Russian scientific organizations, research institutions and universities and the ministries of both countries dedicated themselves to further strengthening ties in the areas of education, research and innovation and affirmed their intentions in a number of written agreements.|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of this partial program BMBF {{supported}} in 1995 altogether 194 <b>marine</b> and <b>polar</b> <b>research</b> projects financing the work of almost 500 persons. Main topics of research activities are: The ocean as a climate factor, the ocean as an ecosystem, the ocean {{as a source of}} ressources, ocean research technique and ocean control technique. The aims of the involved individual projects are presented together with results obtained in 1995. The scope of the supported worldwide projects include the following themes: JGOFS I (Joint global ocean flux study - Atlantic/Pacific), WOCE (World ocean circulation experiment), TOGA (Tropical ocean and global atmosphere), JOPS-II (Joint oceanographic projects), SYSTEM LAPTEV-SEA (marine matter circulations, sedimentation, polar ice formation), Red Sea - Gulf of Aqaba, MADAM (ecology and management of the mangroves), JGOFS II (Joint global ocean flux study - INDIK), MOR (Mid ocean ridge-sediments: Rejkjane-ridge), FAMILEU (iron in the chemical milieu of the deep sea), HYDROMILOS (Hydrothermal activity, MILOS), HYDROCELL-I (Hydrothermal circulation cells) and KLARA (sediment input Kara Sea).
