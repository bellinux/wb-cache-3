5|$|Djokovic and Murray {{appeared}} in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray {{had won the}} last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4–0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role reversal in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many unforced errors.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second Zurich disputation, many in the radical wing of the Reformation became {{convinced}} that Zwingli was <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many concessions to the Zurich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. Conrad Grebel, {{the leader of the}} radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view. On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Zurich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, Felix Manz. Grebel and a third leader, George Blaurock, performed the first recorded Anabaptist adult baptisms.|$|E

Therefore, there is a defensive element in deciding whether to kick a bomb. A bomb is useful defensively because {{even if it is}} fielded by the opposition, it is still useful in giving the kicking team ample time to get {{as close as possible to}} the player with the ball which allows the kicking team to prevent the opposing team from <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much ground towards their in goal area.|$|E

25|$|Twelve days later, John A. Volpe, the US Ambassador to Italy, {{reported}} {{through a}} telegram sent to Washington {{that it was}} possible that Balluku and other high defense functionaries had been removed from their posts. The first indication was a discrepancy between Hoxha's and Balluku's opinions on the defense system of Albania; the second was a request from Beijing to Hoxha that he remove Balluku, who was <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many requests on weapons imports from People's Republic of China. The third possibility was the coup d'état intent of Balluku, possibly endorsed by the other pro-Soviet Union defense high functionaries.|$|E

25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{announced}} on June 15, 2015 at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. The game was marketed {{with a wide}} variety of video content, including teasers, gameplay reveals at various awards shows and conferences, cinematic trailers, and an instructional gameplay series. It was also promoted with a set of action figures by toy company Funko, which consisted of Peebee, Liam Kosta, Jaal, Marilynne Ryder, and Archon. One aspect of BioWare's marketing strategy was to avoid discussing certain plot points or <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many promises ahead of time, a plan which helped the company avoid disappointing players if they needed to cut content from the game.|$|E

25|$|After {{opening their}} {{campaign}} with six defeats, Small Heath {{spent most of}} the season in the bottom two positions. They conceded more goals than any other team in the division for the second consecutive season, and scored fewer than all but bottom club West Bromwich Albion. The directors came under criticism for failing to improve the team and for their selection policy: <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many changes to the team from one game to the next, and playing men when they were unfit. A draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, would have secured their First Division status for another year, but they lost, finished 15th of the 16 teams, and were relegated via the test matches. The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals from Small Heath F.C. that the First Division be expanded to 18 teams, and that a two-thirds majority be sufficient to carry a motion rather than three-quarters. Both motions were lost, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1896–97 season.|$|E
25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first season in the top division, and in {{anticipation}} of increased attendances, the club began work on a grandstand and relaid the pitch. Over the next few years, they purchased the remaining eleven years of the lease on the Coventry Road ground, and bought the grandstand from Aston Villa's Wellington Road ground {{to use as a}} terrace cover, providing more covered standing accommodation. Despite the misgivings of the Daily Post that the squad was too small, the team finished 12th of 16. They opened the 1895–96 campaign with six defeats, spent most of it in the bottom two places, conceded more goals than any other team in the division for the second consecutive season, and scored fewer than all but bottom club West Bromwich Albion. The directors were criticised for failing to improve the team and for their selection policy: <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many changes to the team from one game to the next, and playing men when they were unfit. A draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, would have secured their First Division status for another year, but they lost, finished 15th of the 16 teams, and were relegated. Following the relegation, Fred Wheldon, who had scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup, left for League champions Aston Villa for a fee of £350, which was reported to be a national record.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{legislation}} passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave {{to tend to}} children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies who ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part {{of the labor force}} are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.|$|E

500|$|Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it {{is fairly}} easy for a crooked sports {{official}} to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a [...] "rogue official". According to Lang, an official can directly influence {{the outcome of a}} game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much money to risk their future.

500|$|Conroy {{had played}} for Home Farm in a {{friendly}} match against Stoke City {{at the age of}} 17 and impressed City manager Tony Waddington, who continued to track Conroy's progress via his local scout George Eastham, Sr. However Fulham initially agreed a fee with Glentoran, but Waddington took the same train as Conroy after he left negotiations at Craven Cottage and successfully talked Conroy into signing with Stoke. This approach was actually an illegal approach according to FA rules. Conroy turned down a printer's apprenticeship after his talk with Waddington and moved across the Irish Sea in March 1967 for a fee of £15,000 (£10,000 plus two conditional bonus payments of £2,500). In the summer he was registered with the Cleveland Stokers, Stoke City's United Soccer Association franchise team, and in his own words [...] "played a handful of games without <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much impact".|$|E
500|$|To {{design the}} new palace, Catherine brought back Philibert de l'Orme from disgrace. This arrogant genius had been sacked as {{superintendent}} of royal buildings {{at the end}} of Henry II's reign, after <b>making</b> <b>too</b> many enemies.• Randall, 82–84. The reasons for de l'Orme's disgrace are not clear, but it seems that he was prone to arrogance and had made enemies.• Zerner, 402. Zerner, who calls him [...] "haughty", mentions allegations of embezzlement and an incident in which de l'Orme and his brother killed two men in a brawl. De l'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture, but his ideas are not fully known. It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles. De l'Orme is said to have [...] "taught France the classical style—lucid, rational and regular". He notes, however, that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen. The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to Bullant's later work and to a less classical style of architecture.|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{goals of}} 4A Games was to improve and refine {{numerous}} aspects of 2033 which THQ described as a [...] "flawed masterpiece". The strong focus on atmosphere was retained, but the team overhauled numerous gameplay mechanics. The game's shooting mechanics were improved, and the firearms featured in the game were no longer underpowered. The animation system was reworked and more visual effects were added. The game's artificial intelligence was also refined to become more responsive to players' actions. After hearing from players about 2033s bullet-based economic system, the team decided to keep the feature in Last Light but improve the explanation about how it worked so that players would not be confused by it. [...] In addition, the team revealed {{that they would not}} westernize the franchise to attract a larger audience. Instead, they would overhaul the game's controls to make it more accessible. The team also drastically improved the game's stealth sections. The core philosophy in designing these sections was [...] "fun"; players would not be punished too harshly if they made any mistakes, such as <b>making</b> <b>too</b> much noise. As a result, the alertness of the artificial intelligence features several different levels, making the game more realistic. A competitive multiplayer mode was originally planned that was said to be unique to the Metro series, and would not simply include typical multiplayer modes like team deathmatch or Capture the Flag. However, it was eventually cancelled; but the possibility of having a multiplayer mode remained, and it could be developed after the game's release.|$|E

[...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room.
