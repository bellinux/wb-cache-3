40|$|Under a {{generalized}} coordinate transformation with arbitrary grid velocity, the gas-kinetic BGK equation is reformulated in a moving frame of reference. Then, a unified conservative gas-kinetic scheme is {{developed for the}} viscous flow computation in the <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> system in the Eulerian space. Due to the coupling between the grid velocity and the overall solution algorithm, the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods become two limiting cases in the current gas-kinetic method. A fully conservative formulation can be obtained even in the Lagrangian limit. The <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> method extends the applicable regime of the gas-kinetic scheme to the flows with free surface or moving boundaries, such as dam break problem and airfoil oscillations. In order to further increase the robustness of the <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> method, similar to the arbitrary Lagrangian-Euterian (ALE) method, a conservative adaptive grid technique is also implemented in the current method to redistribute the mesh concentration to the rapid variational flow region and remedy the distorted moving mesh due to the coupling between grid velocity and fluid speed. Many numerical examples from incompressible flow to the supersonic shock interaction are presented. The test cases verify the accuracy and robustness of the unified <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> gas-kinetic method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{flow field}} and {{the motion of the}} free surface in an {{oscillating}} container are simulated numerically to assess the numerical approach for studying two-phase flows under oscillating conditions. Two numerical methods are compared: one is to model the oscillating container directly using the <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> of the ALE method, and the other is to simulate the effect of container motion using the oscillating body force acting on the fluid in the stationary container. The two-phase flow field in the container is simulated using the level set method in both cases. It is found that the calculated results by the body force method coinsides with those by the <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> method and the sloshing behavior is predicted well by both the methods.

40|$|The {{geometric}} conservation law (GCL) is {{an important}} concept for <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> techniques because it directly regulates the treatments of the fluid flow and grid movement. With the grid movement at every time instant, the Jacobian, associated with the volume of each element in curvilinear co-ordinates, needs to be updated in a conservative manner. In this study, alternative GCL schemes for evaluating the Jacobian have been investigated {{in the context of}} a pressure-based Navier-Stokes solver, utilizing <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> and the first-order implicit time stepping procedure as well as the PISO scheme. GCL-based on first and second-order, implicit as well as time-averaged, time integration schemes were considered. Accuracy and conservative properties were tested on steady-state, laminar flow inside a 2 D channel and time dependent, turbulent flow around a 3 D elastic wing; both treated with <b>moving</b> <b>grid</b> techniques. It seems that the formal order of accuracy is not a decisive indicator. Instead, the speed of grid movement and the interplay between the flow solver and the GCL treatments make a more noticeable impact...|$|E
