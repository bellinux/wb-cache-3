Bench-scale membrane filtration experiments were conducted with 2, 4, 6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), which is of special interest as a model compound due to its very low odor threshold level (i. e., 10 ng/L). Four different tight ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, with different <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>cutoffs</b> (MWCO) and hydrophobicities were investigated. The removal of TCA decreased with increasing permeability for all of the UF membranes tested. Relatively hydrophobic UF membranes, even those with higher MWCO and permeability values, exhibited much higher TCA removal efficiencies than relatively hydrophilic UF membranes, both in the presence and absence of hydrophobic natural organic matter (Suwannee River NOM). The adsorption of TCA onto the membrane surfaces/pores through the hydrophobic interaction was found to be important for the efficient removals of TCA by hydrophobic UF membranes, especially those with greater hydrophobicities.

In addition, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Fourier Infrared (FTiR) were employed to evaluate the changes in the semipermeable membranes and PEG molecules, respectively. The water content of the clay obtained from the osmotic tests was found to be greater at the overlapping suction region. Interestingly, under UVGI exposure, the water content was found to be in good agreement with the water content determined using the osmotic technique at low suctions and the vapour equilibrium technique at higher suctions.

40|$|Micellar-enhanced {{extraction}} (MEEX) is {{a solvent}} extraction process which transfers organic solutes from wastewater to an aqueous surfactant phase containing micelles which solubilize the solutes. The feed and solvent contact each other across a microporous membrane having pore sizes small enough to prevent the micelles from crossing the membrane and contaminating the purified water. Back-contamination of the wastewater by surfactant monomers which cross the membrane is minimized by using a surfactant with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC). MEEX was demonstrated with an aqueous feed solution containing 500 ppm of benzoic acid as a model solute. The aqueous solvent contained a cationic tertiary amine surfactant, with an 18 carbon tail and two polyoxyethylene head groups, at concentrations between 0 and 17 g/L. The surfactant was characterized by surface tension measurements and by solubilization studies using semiequilibrium dialysis. The surface tension-derived CMC was approximately 0. 04 g/L. MEEX {{was carried out in}} tubular hollow fiber membrane units with <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>cutoffs</b> of either 5000 or 30000. The units contained 35 tubes of 30 cm length with inside diameters of 0. 55 mm. The best results were obtained when the solvent was on the tube side. A model was developed for MEEX that incorporates solubilization equilibrium data. The overall benzoic acid mass transfer coefficient, based on the internal area of the tubes, and the flux of benzoic acid across the membrane were calculated. The flux of benzoic acid across the membrane opposed the overall concentration difference in the presence of surfactant. The back-contamination of the wastewater by the surfactant was at a concentration close to the CMC, except for surfactant solutions containing more than 8 g/L. With a concentration of 8 g/L of surfactant, the benzoic acid concentration was reduced from 475 to 55 ppm, a reduction of 88 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} silage inoculant {{mixture of}} Lactobacillus species inhibited aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus subsp parasiticus. Germination of mold spores was inhibited by actively growing Lactobacillus cells, however Lactobacillus cell free supernatant {{did not affect}} mold spore viability. Aflatoxin production was inhibited in Lablemco Tryptone Broth (LTB) by Lactobacillus species growing inside dialysis sacks (<b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>cutoffs</b> of 1000, 6 - 8000 and 12 - 14, 000) immersed in the LTB. Aflatoxin levels were also significantly reduced when Lactobacillus species were inoculated into a growing mold culture, and also when mold spores were injected into Lactobacillus cultures. Different Lactobacillus isolates were purified from the silage inoculant mixture. Some of the isolates {{had no effect on}} mold growth and aflatoxin production. Other Lactobacillus isolates showed various degrees of aflatoxin inhibition. Lactobacillus isolate 371, which was identified as Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum, was found to greatly inhibit the production of aflatoxins B 1 and G 1. The inhibition of aflatoxins by Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 was not eliminated by replacing an amount of glucose equal to the amount used by Lactobacillus sp before inoculation of the mold. The inhibitory principle in a Lactobacillus cell free supernatant was found to be sensitive to trypsin and α-chymotrypsin, but not to pepsin. Dialyzed protein concentrate of the Lactobacillus cell free supernatant greatly inhibited aflatoxin formation. The antiaflatoxigenic activity of the supernatant was destroyed at 100 C within 10 mn. While Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 inhibited aflatoxin production in broth, it did not have any effect on mold growth and aflatoxin production in sterile steamed rice, when mold growth was monitored by ergosterol and plate count techniques. Ergosterol determination was found to be a sensitive indicator of low levels of fungal activity and aflatoxin production in rice. Ergosterol formation in rice followed the same trend as aflatoxin B 1 production. The inhibitory activity of the Lactobacillus isolate was shown to inactivate the enzymatic system required for the production of aflatoxin B 1. ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research are to predict transport of model drugs in triphasic (oil, water and micellar) emulsion system using various physicochemical parameters and mathematical models and {{to determine the effect}} of surface—active model drugs on transport in triphasic emulsions and on emulsion stability. Excess surfactant is present in most emulsions in the form of monomers and micelles to aid the stability of these systems. Excess surfactant may alter the kinetics of drug release by: micellar solubilization, alteration of the drug partitioning process, and drug/surfactant complexation. Surface—active drugs may associate with the surfactant and may alter the interfacial area, emulsion stability and transport kinetics of the drugs across the emulsion interface. A range of model drugs with similar structures, different lipophilicities and different surface—activities were selected to investigate the influence of excess surfactant on model drug transport and emulsion stability in triphasic systems. Phenylazoaniline, Benzocaine, Phenobarbital and Barbital were investigated. Light mineral oil was chosen as the oil phase. An ionic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and a nonionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether were chosen to determine the effect of the ionic nature of the surfactant on model drug transport and emulsion stability in triphasic systems. Model drug transport in the triphasic systems was investigated using side-by-side diffusion cells mounted with hydrophilic dialysis membranes (<b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>cutoffs</b> 1 KD and 50 KD) and bulk equilibrium reverse dialysis bag method. The bulk equilibrium reverse dialysis bag method involves infinite dilution of the emulsions in a continuous phase and the model drugs are released into suspended dialysis bags. Emulsion stability was determined by droplet size analysis as a function of time and temperature using photon correlation spectroscopy and a light blockage technique. Violation of sink conditions during the transport studies occurred using the side-by-side diffusion cell method. This limitation was overcome using the bulk equilibrium reverse dialysis bag technique. The transport rate of the model drugs in triphasic systems were affected by the ionic nature of the surfactants, model drug surface—activity and lipophilicity. Mathematical models were developed using Fick 2 ̆ 7 s first law and consecutive rate equations. The models were predictive of the experimental data. ...|$|R
