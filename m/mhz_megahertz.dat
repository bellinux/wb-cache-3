50|$|In the 6 <b>MHz</b> (<b>megahertz)</b> channel {{used for}} {{broadcast}} ATSC, 8VSB carries a symbol rate of 10.76 megabaud, a {{gross bit rate}} of 32 Mbit/s, and a net bit rate of 19.39 Mbit/s of usable data. The net bit rate is lower due to the addition of forward error correction codes. The eight signal levels are selected {{with the use of}} a trellis encoder. There are also similar modulations 2VSB, 4VSB, and 16VSB. 16VSB was notably intended to be used for ATSC digital cable, but quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) has become the de facto industry standard instead as it is cheap and readily available.|$|E
5000|$|The other {{meaning of}} the term [...] "channel" [...] in {{telecommunications}} is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium {{so that it can be}} used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5 <b>MHz</b> (<b>megahertz)</b> while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1 MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about 180 kHz (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [...] "carrier frequencies". Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200 kHz, and the difference between 200 kHz and 180 kHz (20 kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.|$|E

5000|$|In English, [...] "hertz" [...] is {{also used}} as the plural form. As an SI unit, Hz can be prefixed; {{commonly}} used multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 103 Hz), <b>MHz</b> (<b>megahertz,</b> 106 Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 109 Hz) and THz (terahertz, 1012 Hz). One hertz simply means [...] "one cycle per second" [...] (typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle); 100 Hz means [...] "one hundred cycles per second", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event—for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz. The occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second (1/s or s−1) in general or, in the specific case of radioactive decay, in becquerels. Whereas 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second, 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radionuclide event per second.|$|E
