2500|$|For a <b>monodisperse</b> aerosol, {{a single}} number—the {{particle}} diameter—suffices {{to describe the}} size of the particles. However, more complicated particle-size distributions describe the sizes of the particles in a polydisperse aerosol.

However, this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use. Another approach splits the complete size range into intervals and finds the number (or proportion) of particles in each interval. One then can visualize these data in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin, usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents.
