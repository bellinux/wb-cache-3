40|$|Abstract: The newest {{version of}} Globus Toolkit (GT 4) adopts services-oriented {{architecture}} to provide grid environment based on Web Services. However, Globus Toolkit {{does not guarantee}} to reliably send and receive messages during messages passing between Web Services. Furthermore, the <b>messages</b> <b>communication</b> mechanism which Globus Toolkit Java Web Services Core provides {{is based on the}} changes of resource properties. In other words, it regards messages as resources properties but that is unreasonable for the perspectives of the programmers. In this research, we integrate GT 4 Java WS core and our persistent version of JMS middleware (PFJM) to design reasonable programming styles and provide convenient and useful tools for Web Services development users by wrapping PFJM into PFJM Web Services (PFJM WS). Finally, we give a throughput test of <b>messages</b> <b>communication</b> respectively for GT 4 Java WS core and PFJM WS. In the report, we can see that PFJM WS has a higher performance than GT 4 Java WS core...|$|R

40|$|The text <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> {{system is}} one modern {{electronic}} medium of communication that is systematically transforming written communication. It has both {{the positive and}} the negative sides just {{like that of the}} electricity current. The positive side of the text <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> simply refers to its pros, that is, its advantages, merits or benefits. The negative side of the text <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> refers to its cons, that is, its disadvantages, demerits or shortcomings. This paper explores the pros of text <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> by analysing how it saves time, reduces cost, aids articulate feedback, ensures convenient response, serves as legal evidence, encourages bold reply, functions as a forensic tool, represents a more health-friendly medium and guarantees confidentiality. The paper equally examines the cons of text <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> by explicating how it can aid crime, be used to defraud, implicate message sender when not deleted, be vague/ambiguous because of its abbreviated language, be delivered late when events have overtaken message sent, be reduced in length and rendered incomplete when message is lengthy, be limited in use to literate people only, be used to perpetrate examination malpractices and be responded to late when the receiver has a busy or tight schedule...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} an experience on solving DCOP instances in a real, distributed scenario with up-to-date technology involving several machines and comparing this process with their solving in a simulator. From {{the result of}} this experience, we stress the importance of <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> time, orders of magnitude higher than the elements used in other proposed metrics to assess DCOP algorithms performance. Network latency, captured in <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> time, has an important impact in final performance and it must be necessarily taken into account to accurately approximate the elapsed time of the solving process. The results of this paper are an indicator of this, and we think they may be of interest for the Distributed Constraint Reasoning (DCR) community. ...|$|E

Under congestion-prone adjacent and non-adjacent node communication patterns, we use our developed GSPN routing models to {{study the effects of}} congestion (arising due to problems such as buffer overflow and traffic contention) on the <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> latency of multicomputer networks.

40|$|Vehicular {{traffic density}} {{is a key}} factor in {{determining}} the behaviour of radio overlapping and thus impacts performance of data and safety <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). In this paper, we propose a novel density model for urban traffic systems and employ this model for the purpose of spatial-temporal analysis of radio overlapping. To model traffic density, we consider a signalized junction and road segments linked to that junction as basic building blocks of urban traffic systems. The density model enables us to derive a framework to explain trends and critical regions of radio overlapping corresponding to VANET scenarios targeted for urban transportation systems, which cannot be derived from uniform density models widely used in existing literature. We apply the derived radio overlapping model to study channel load associated with periodic beaconing, a fundamental mechanism for safety <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> in VANETs. This study also provides a generic analytical framework to investigate other performance aspects of data and safety <b>message</b> <b>communication</b> in VANETs. Our experimental results using the proposed realistic density model demonstrate the need for an adaptive mechanism to adjust transmission power and data rate to reduce channel loads associated with dense traffic conditions...|$|E
