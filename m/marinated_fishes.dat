40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Allergy to Anisakis simplex (s.) is {{spreading}} {{due to the}} increased consumption of raw, smoked or <b>marinated</b> <b>fish.</b> In humans, Anisakis s. can directly attack the gastrointestinal mucosa, provoking a parasitosis known as anisakiasis, or giving rise {{to the formation of}} IgE and, finally, inducing IgE-mediated reactions like urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic shock. During recent years, a dietary approach to Anisakis s. infestation has also been addressed. METHODS: A total of 620 patients with urticaria, angioedema, or both and a history of anaphylaxis following consumption of raw, smoked or <b>marinated</b> <b>fish</b> were recruited, evaluated for specific IgE levels to Anisakis s. and subjected to skin prick test. Following 18 month fish-free diet, patients were re-evaluated at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. RESULTS: After 6 -month fish-free diet, we recorded an improvement of symptoms and a remarkable reduction of specific IgE levels. The extension of the diet over 6 months in some cases resulted in a further reduction of specific IgE levels. CONCLUSION: Data obtained confirm the importance of a fish-free diet in patients with severe symptoms since a new antigenic exposure coincides with a relapse of symptoms and increased IgE levels. This last point should be kept in mind and carefully evaluated in patients at risk for anaphylaxis or angioedem...|$|R

The objective of this work was to analyze the variations in the chemical compounds of anchovy fillets that give them sensorial characteristics during the marinating process of Engraulis anchoita. The protein content decreased slightly and the TVB-N level decreased significantly in both the brining and marinating stages. In the marinating stage {{an increase in the}} total free aminoacids was observed. The NBV level in the brining and marinating solutions increased during these stages due to the solubilization of the non-protein nitrogenous compounds and the degradation of some protein compounds.

40|$|Anisakiasis is a {{worldwide}} re-emerging disease {{produced by the}} consumption of raw, lightly cooked, smoked or <b>marinated</b> <b>fish</b> containing live Anisakis larvae. In acute anisakiasis, mucosal lesions generated by the larvae may provoke upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). However, the effect of past unnoticed Anisakis infections as {{a risk factor for}} UGIB, and a possible synergism with other risk factors such as NSAIDs intake, have never been investigated. In this case-control study we observed that: i) prior Anisakis infections and NSAIDs intake are two independent risk factors for UGIB, and ii) that both risk factors act synergistically to the extent that their joint effect is 3 times higher than the sum of their individual effects. We concluded that, in countries where Anisakis infections are frequent, {{it would be wise to}} determine parasite-specific IgE antibodies and to conduct a closer follow-up of patients who consume raw or lightly cooked fish and who are prescribed NSAIDs for long periods...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Tapeworms (Cestoda) {{continue}} {{to be an important}} cause of morbidity in humans worldwide. Diphyllobothriosis, a human disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Diphyllobothrium, is the most important fish-borne zoonosis caused by a cestode parasite. Up to 20 million humans are estimated to be infected worldwide. Besides humans, definitive hosts of Diphyllobothrium include piscivorous birds and mammals, which represent a significant zoonotic reservoir. The second intermediate hosts include both freshwater and marine fish, especially anadromous species such as salmonids. The zoonosis occurs most commonly in countries where the consumption of raw or <b>marinated</b> <b>fish</b> is a frequent practice. Due to the increasing popularity of dishes utilizing uncooked fish, numerous cases of human infections have appeared recently, even in the most developed countries. As many as 14 valid species of Diphyllobothrium can cause human diphyllobothriosis, with D. latum and D. nihonkaiense being the most important pathogens. In this paper, all taxa from humans reported are reviewed, with brief information on their life history and their current distribution. Data on diagnostics, epidemiology, clinical relevance, and control of the disease are also summarized. The importance of reliable identification of human-infecting species with molecular tools (sequences of mitochondrial genes) as well as the necessity of epidemiological studies aimed at determining the sources of infections are pointed out...|$|R

5000|$|In Peru, ceviche {{has been}} {{declared}} {{to be part of}} Peru's [...] "national heritage" [...] and has even had a holiday declared in its honor. The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw <b>fish,</b> <b>marinated</b> in freshly squeezed key lime or bitter orange (naranja agria) juice, with sliced onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn-on-the-cob, and slices of cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian ají limo, or the Andean chili rocoto, toasted corn or cancha and yuyo (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from shark (tollo or tojo). Lenguado (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of <b>fish</b> <b>marinated</b> {{for a few minutes and}} served promptly.

The frequency in the United States is unknown, because the disease is not reportable and can goundetected or be mistaken for other illnesses. Anisakiasis was first recognized in the 1960s. During the 1970s, about 10 cases per year were reported in the literature. The frequency isprobably much higher, due to home preparation of raw or undercooked fish dishes.

40|$|Quality {{deterioration}} of fish {{is caused by}} various factors, {{one of them is}} due to the activity of cathepsin enzyme. Cathepsin enzyme activity can be inhibited by enzyme inhibitors. Inhibitors of the enzyme can be obtained from fish meat tissue by separating the enzyme-inhibitor complex with heat treatment. The purpose of this research was to extract and apply the cathepsin inhibitors to inhibit {{deterioration of}} fish quality. This research was conducted in three steps: (1) the determination of the optimum extraction temperature for extraction of cathepsin inhibitors, (2) the determination of the most potent cathepsin inhibitors with various concentrations, and (3) the application of cathepsin inhibitors in inhibiting the deterioration of fish quality. The results showed that the cathepsin inhibitors was optimally extracted at 80 °C. Cathepsin inhibitors diluted using buffer with a ratio of 1 : 1 had the same relative activity without dilution. The process of quality deterioration of milkfish control in chilling temperatures occured after 504 hours (21 days) storage with a 24 -hour observation time interval. The complete process during observation was pre-rigor (0 hour), rigor mortis (96 hours), post-rigor (360 hours), and deterioration (504 hours). The process of milkfish quality deterioration treated with soaking in cathepsin inhibitors occured after 624 hours (26 days) storage with the detailed process as follows: 0 hour (pre-rigor), 144 hours (rigor mortis), 408 hours (post-rigor), and 624 hours (deterioration).
