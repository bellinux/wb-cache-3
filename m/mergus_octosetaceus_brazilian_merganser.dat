50|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus)</b> is a duck in {{the typical}} merganser genus.It {{is one of the}} six most {{threatened}} waterfowl in the world with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild and currently 4 kept in captivity at 2 different Brazilian locations. The origin of its name is from its long, sharp-edged beak that has a great number of teeth-looking edges.|$|R

50|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} {{consists of}} mammals, toads, squamates {{and in particular}} {{a wide variety of}} birds. Among the latter, it is known to prefer tree-living species, such as oropendolas, aracaris, tanagers and cotingas. But ground- and waterbirds like tinamous, chachalacas, cormorants and the highly threatened <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus)</b> have also been recorded as its prey. The black-and-white hawk-eagle has been known to attack small monkeys, though it is not clear with which intent. For as it seems, it has not been recorded to actually kill and eat a monkey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study shows}} that {{sampling}} maternal DNA from hatched and abandoned eggshells is a viable noninvasive strategy for studying the genetics of rare or endangered tropical birds, as exemplified here by the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Merganser</b> (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus).</b> Eighteen microsatellites were isolated from enriched libraries and nine heterologous loci from related species were tested. Seven loci were amplified successfully, with five of them being polymorphic. These loci exhibited amplicons ranging from 110 to 254 bp for 132 samples, with 60 from eggshells and 72 from blood or muscle samples. The number of alleles for M. octosetaceus ranged from one to six (mean = 3. 71), which is low compared to M. merganser (1 - 15 alleles), a ‘least concern’ species. Genetic diversity {{did not differ significantly}} between noninvasive and invasive samples (Z(u) = 0. 31, p = 0. 37). Thus, noninvasive sampling, as demonstrated here with eggshells, provides an efficient means to assess genetic diversity in tropical birds without the need to capture and handle them...|$|R
50|$|Another {{threat to}} the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> is tourism. The scenic beauty of Serra de Canastra National Park brings {{people from around the}} world to see the {{ecotourism}} landmark. Tourists are attracted to the abundant supply of clear water with over 150 waterfalls in the area. Sporting activities also create a disturbance for the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers.</b> Activities such as canoeing and rafting disturb the natural habitats for the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> that thrive on the rapid-rivers. With the activities being haphazardly practiced and the increasing amount of facilities being built on the margin of the rivers, they may cause serious threats to the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> populations. It disturbs the area of use and their breeding patterns and its habitat due to water course pollution and deforestation.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{availability}} of suitable nesting and feeding sites, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> pairs occupy permanent territories of eight to seventeen kilometer stretches of rivers. Tree cavities, rock crevices, or disused burrows predominantly made by armadillos are the ideal places for these mergansers to build their nests. It is thought the breeding season is during the austral winter, when rain is minimal and water levels are low, but it may vary geographically. The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> usually lays three to six eggs in June and July, with the chicks hatching during the following July and August. The young are capable of flight by September and/or October. Only the female birds incubate the eggs, but both parents care for the young. This is a very unusual behavior in ducks for both parents to help raise the young birds including direct provision of food to young. Adult <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> are believed to remain on the same territory all year round, but there is not very much information about their movements and dispersal, so information on this is presently speculative in nature. Fish is the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser's</b> main food, and they also eat molluscs, insects and their larvae. The birds, usually in pairs, capture fish by diving in river rapids and backwater.|$|R
40|$|Serra da Canastra National Park (SCNP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} protected areas in the Cerrado biome. Despite its importance to the conservation of rare and endangered species like <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Merganser,</b> two bills were approved in 2010 by Brazil's Chamber of Deputies aiming to reduce SCNP's official boundaries and to transform some of its parts into an Environmental Protection Area (EPA). We evaluated whether such changes would facilitate mining areas to be legally exploited within the park's area, and if those mining areas would represent a threat to <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Merganser</b> populations at SCNP. Results showed that 55 % of the mining areas currently within the National Park will be located within the new EPA, and six hydrographic micro-basins inhabited by <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Merganser</b> could be affected by environmental impacts caused by mineral exploitation in those areas. For these reasons, we recommend the two bills be refused at the Federal Senate...|$|R
50|$|The slender <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> live in low densities {{in remote}} and mountainous regions where it inhabits clean {{rivers and streams}} with river rapids and {{riparian}} vegetation. <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> are very territorial birds defending large stretches of river and the land surrounding the fast-flowing water. They are recognized as a resident species that do not abandon the watercourses where it established its territory, which some think is a reason the birds are endangered. They don't move or want to move once their habitats have disappeared. The birds need large territories and their habitat is fast dwindling.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to habitat degradation and loss primarily due to human actions. A major threat to the birds' survival is the issue of silting of rivers caused by the expansion of farming activities, mining, watershed degradation and soil erosion, as well as deforestation. Current traditional soil management and use practices in the region from farming may bring about serious damage regarding conservation of natural resources, especially water, on which the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> and the farmers themselves are dependent. One of the farming practices here is shifting cultivation. It is common in the region to see farmers burning forest areas causing environmental damage to the natural vegetation and soils and the resident species. [...] A new threat to the species includes the installation of hydroelectric plants. Hydropower plants are planned to be built in the same rivers that <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> have been found in Paraná (rio Tibagi), Goiás (rio Paranã) and Tocantins (rio Novo). The hydropower plants are a major threat to the birds' survival because the plants transform systems such as creeks, rivers and streams into turbid lake systems. The project has government backing in spite of the damage it may cause. Dam-building has also become a major part in the disappearance of these birds. The filling of the Urugua-i reservoir, which took place between 1989 and 1991, had a major impact on <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> in Argentina. The population declined drastically when its fast-flowing rivers were turned into large lakes. After the Urugua-i dam was built, the birds have only been seen on the Uruzu stream, a tributary of the Urugua-i. The dams flood suitable habitat, especially in Brazil and Paraguay, where the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> build their nests and lay their eggs.|$|R

50|$|This merganser is a dark, slender duck with a shiny dark-green hood {{with a long}} crest, {{which is}} usually shorter and more worn-looking in females. Upperparts are dark grey while the breast is light grey, getting paler toward the whitish belly, and a white wing patch is {{particularly}} noticeable in flight. It has a long thin jagged black bill with red feet and legs. Although females are smaller with a shorter bill and crest, both sexes are alike in color. The slender ducks {{range in size from}} 49 centimeters to 56 centimeters as an adult. Young <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> are mainly black with white throat and breast. The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> are generally silent birds, but may make barking calls in certain situations. Four calls have been recorded. A harsh krack-krack acts as an alarm call emitted in flight. Males make a barking dog-like call, females make a harsh rrr-rrrr and the contact call ia a soft rak-rak-rak. Ducklings give a high pitched ik-ik-ik.|$|R
50|$|The total world {{population}} for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>mergansers</b> {{is believed to}} be less than 250 birds. Originally, the duck's geographical distribution comprised central-south Brazil and adjacent regions in Paraguay and Argentina. Currently, all confirmed populations are located in Brazil and a more recent population in Argentina and information on most populations is very scarce. The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> population in the Serra da Canastra region is the most significant and best known, with populations occurring hundreds of kilometers away from each other. There are 47 individuals—28 adults and 19 young—in the Serra de Canastra region as of 2006. Most mergansers are found in the Serra da Canastra National Park. 70 birds have been seen near the park's headquarters in rio São Francisco. In Jalapão region are estimated 13 individuals in Novo river on 2009/2010 (four couples and some solitary adults). In 2002, the species was also found on the Arroyo Uruzu in Misiones, Argentina, the first record in the country for ten years, despite extensive surveys done by local researchers conducted throughout previous years. The bird was last reported seen in 1984 in Paraguay, where very little habitat remains; however some local reports show that a few individuals may still be living in the area.|$|R
50|$|Most birds {{found in}} the Cerrado breed there {{although}} there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through. Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats. Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest. The crowned solitary eagle, hyacinth macaw, toco toucan, buff-necked ibis, dwarf tinamou, and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>merganser</b> are examples of birds {{found in the}} Cerrado.|$|R

They are found in fresh-water as well as marine habitats, and primarily have Northern Hemisphere distribution patterns. Except for the two isolated Southern Hemisphere species, all of the sea ducks have considerable sexual dimorphism in plumage. Males in breeding plumage are usually elaborately patterned, often with predominantly black and white markings, which probably serve very well to localize and identify these birds at considerable distances in their marine environments. However, iridescent coloration is generally limited to the head, and the wing speculum patterns, instead of being iridescent, are generally white and black. Nesting is usually done on fairly open shoreline or in grassy tundra, as in the eiders and long-tailed duck, or in cavities, under heavy brush, or in similar well-concealed locations, as in the goldeneyes, mergansers, and harlequin duck. Females of the ground-nesting forms approach the patterns found among female dabbling ducks in their cryptic coloration, and the downy young of these species are also rather brownish and obscurely patterned. Females of the hole-nesting species are more uniformly brownish and their ducklings are frequently contrastingly spotted with white and dark markings...|$|R
