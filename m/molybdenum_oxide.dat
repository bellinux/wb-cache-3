The characteristic of the new process is by using of the cheaper <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxides</b> powder as alloy agent which can improve the flexibility of choosing main raw materials.

In the present study, however <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxides</b> exhibited an epoxidation activity in the gas phase. To achieve this activity, the oxidation state, particle sizes and accessibility of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxides</b> are needed to be controlled. Such active molybdenum species can be prepared by PVD deposition of molybdenum nanorods and their subsequent oxidation in a controlled atmosphere. Accordingly, monoclinic MoO 2 particles with a diameter of < 10 nm can be prepared, which exhibit 42 % selectivity to propylene oxide (the byproducts of the oxidation being mainly acrolein and acetone). In comparison, molybdenum-containing catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation methods exhibited practically zero epoxidation activity in gas-phase epoxidation of propylene.

50|$|One {{issue with}} {{utilizing}} SWCNTs for the photoactive layer of PV devices is the mixed purity when synthesized (about 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting). Metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) can cause exciton recombination between the electron and hole pairs, and the junction between metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) form Schottky barriers that reduce the hole transmission probability. The discrepancy in electronic structure of synthesized CNTs requires electronic sorting to separate {{and remove the}} m-SWCNTs to optimize the semiconducting performance. This may be accomplished through diameter and electronic sorting of CNTs through a density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) process, involving a gradient of surfactants that can separate the CNTs by diameter, chirality, and electronic type. This sorting method enables the separation of m-SWCNTs and the precise collection of multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs, each chirality able to absorb a unique wavelength of light. The multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs are used as the hole transport material along with the fullerene component PC71BM to fabricate heterojunctions for the PV active layer. The polychiral s-SWCNTs enable a wide range optical absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) light, increasing the photo current relative to using single chirality nanotubes. To maximize light absorption, the inverted device structure was used with a zinc oxide nanowire layer penetrating the active layer to minimize collection length. <b>Molybdenum</b> <b>oxide</b> (MoOx) was utilized as a high work function hole transport layer to maximize voltage.|$|E

The amount of dispersed <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxide</b> as well as the ratio of dispersed to crystalline <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxide</b> was determined in detail for Mo densities of 0 – 13. 0  atoms[*]nm− 2 by using a combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Raman spectroscopy.

At higher densities, additional Mo is introduced as crystalline MoO 3, and the amount of dispersed species remains unchanged. The structure of the supported <b>molybdenum</b> <b>oxide</b> under ambient conditions largely resembles that of heptamolybdate ions.
