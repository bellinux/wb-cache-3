5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum <b>mixture</b> <b>ratio</b> being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant <b>mixture</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{combustion}} wave ignition concept was experimentally studied {{in order to}} verify its suitability for application in baffled sections of a large booster engine combustion chamber. Gaseous oxygen/gaseous methane (GOX/GH 4) and gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (GOX/GH 2) propellant combinations were evaluated in a subscale {{combustion wave}} ignition system. The system included four element tubes capable of carrying ignition energy simultaneously to four locations, simulating four baffled sections. Also, direct ignition of a simulated Main Combustion Chamber (MCC) was performed. Tests were conducted over a range of <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios</b> and tube geometries. Ignition was consistently attained {{over a wide range}} of <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios.</b> And at every ignition, the flame propagated through all four element tubes. For GOX/GH 4, the ignition system ignited the MCC flow at <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios</b> from 2 to 10 and for GOX/GH 2 the ratios is from 2 to 13. The ignition timing was found to be rapid and uniform.

A total of seven 200 second duration tests were performed. The LNG testing occurred at low injection densities, similar to the previous LO 2 /RP- 1, LO 2 /propane, and LO 2 /methane testing performed on the carbon deposition program. The current LO 2 /methane test series occurred at an injection density factor of approximately 10 {{times higher than the}} previous testing.
