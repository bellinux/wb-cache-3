5|$|The {{valley is}} traversed by a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> which terminates {{at the small}} {{settlement}} of Castellar del Riu at its western end. The road passes close by Pi de les Tres Branques, which is indicated by a signpost.|$|E
5|$|Tinsley Green, a hamlet in Worth parish, is now {{within the}} Pound Hill neighbourhood. Its houses, farms and public house, the Greyhound (at which the British and World Marbles Championship {{has been held}} {{annually}} since 1932), lie on or around an east–west <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> running from the main Balcombe–Horley road to the Manor Royal estate.|$|E
5|$|The newest {{bridge across}} the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> over the river, and another <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill {{has been the subject}} of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.|$|E

5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{necessary}} {{amount of land}} for siting runways of sufficient length, the A372 to Othery was closed and diverted south on a former <b>minor</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{main road}} from Colchester to Bures and Sudbury (B1508) runs from {{south-east}} to north-west across the parish. <b>Minor</b> <b>roads</b> connected the parish with Assington (Suffolk) across Wormingford bridge, with Fordham, and with Little Horkesley and Nayland (Suffolk). Other <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> and tracks {{and a network}} of footpaths link the scattered farms and houses.|$|R
25|$|From the former, a cycle path runs {{alongside}} between adjoining villages Greatham and West Liss. The path {{is on the}} London-bound side, linking to a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> {{bridge over}} the A3 to West Liss which {{is close to the}} centre of Liss.|$|E
25|$|Cadover Cross {{is located}} on Wigford Down, about 250metres north-west of Cadover Bridge on the <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> between Plympton and Yelverton. Two {{important}} 12th century routes used the river crossing here: one leading from Tavistock to Plympton Priory, the other to Ivybridge via Cornwood, so {{it is likely that}} the cross existed then. The first documentary evidence for it is a mention as a boundary mark in 1381.|$|E
25|$|A new flyover {{just south}} of Joan Croft level {{crossing}} in South Yorkshire to allow freight trains from Immingham to pass over the line {{on their way to}} Eggborough and Drax power stations, was completed in very early 2014. The project, known as the North Doncaster Chord, also replaced the level crossing on a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> with a new overbridge just {{to the north of the}} original crossing point.|$|E

25|$|Some valleys {{which are}} not {{penetrated}} by A roads are served by B roads. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and Buttermere and links via the Honister Pass with Borrowdale. The B5292 ascends the Whinlatter Pass from Lorton Vale before dropping down to Braithwaite near Keswick. The B5322 serves the valley of St John's in the Vale whilst Great Langdale is served by the B5343. Other valleys such as Little Langdale, Eskdale and Dunnerdale are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the Wrynose and Hardknott passes respectively; both of these passes {{are known for their}} steep gradients and are together {{one of the most popular}} climbs in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts. A <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> through the Newlands Valley connects via Newlands Hause with the B5289 at Buttermere. Wasdale is served by a cul-de-sac <b>minor</b> <b>road,</b> as are Longsleddale and the valleys at Haweswater and Kentmere. There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.|$|E
25|$|Four roads {{cross the}} moors {{from north to}} south. In the east the A171 joins Whitby and Scarborough. Further inland, the A169 runs between Pickering and Whitby. More centrally, a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> departs from the A170 at Keldholme and passes through Castleton before joining the A171 which connects Whitby and Guisborough. The most {{westerly}} route is the B1257 connecting Helmsley to Stokesley. The A170 from Thirsk to Scarborough marks the southern boundary of the moors area.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the fell are all formed by roads and tracks, giving opportunities for circular walks. The main Ambleside-Coniston road lies {{to the east and}} the <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> along Little Langdale to the north. Yewdale Beck runs around the southern perimeter, with the narrow access lane to Hodge Close hugging its bank. From Hodge Close a bridleway runs north to Little Langdale. The southern half of the fell has much natural woodland, mostly deciduous species. There are also some larger artificial plantings to the north.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{leaves the}} main line of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Calf Heath. There is a large marina on its north side, close to the junction, after which a bridge carries a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> over the canal, before it enters the first lock. Above the lock, a wider section {{provides}} additional mooring space before the second lock. This has been modified to include a ledge to one side, which provides dry dock facilities for the nearby boatyard. Exit {{from the top of}} the lock by boat is not possible.|$|E
25|$|Some large lakes {{are located}} {{to the north}} of the channel, which were {{formerly}} a sand and gravel pit. High Bridge carries the road from Blackborough End to Wormegay over the river, and Setchey Bridge carries the A10 road at Setchey. A little to the west, the channel turns to the north, where it is crossed by the railway line from Downham Market to King's Lynn. The A47 road, the A148 road and another <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> cross at South Lynn, and the river then joins the River Great Ouse at a sluice.|$|E
25|$|Past the NY19 junction, US20A {{continues}} east along Buffalo Street to {{the eastern}} edge of the village and the valley, where the route turns a full 90degrees to the north to climb the side of the Oatka Valley. The route ascends approximately , passing under the Rochester and Southern Railroad (RSR)—which runs along the foot of the gorge—before exiting the valley and returning to an eastwest alignment as it heads toward Perry and points east. All oversize trucks are prohibited from using the section of US20A between NY19 and <b>Minor</b> <b>Road</b> at the top of the valley due to the steep grade of the hill and the sharp curve at the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The {{village has}} no real main street, being rather the {{crossroads}} of several <b>minor</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R

25|$|The fell {{is usually}} climbed from the <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> which {{runs along the}} base of the hill. From here Buckbarrow looks quite {{formidable}} and the crags are a deterrent to a direct ascent; however, all danger can be bypassed by starting the climb at the more westerly point of Harrow Head farm and following Gill Beck up to a height of around 350m (1,150ft) before bearing north easterly to the highest point above the crags. An alternative is to climb from Greendale, via Greendale Gill and Tongues Gills. Buckbarrow can also be bagged almost as an afterthought as the walker descends from Seatallan. Buckbarrow’s formidable crags are a popular rock climbing venue.|$|E
25|$|Keddington, {{where much}} of the parish church dates from the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, was the site of Keddington Church Lock, {{although}} little of it remains. Ticklepenny Lock is better preserved, with four concave sections separated by timber posts. The third section is partially hidden by a twentieth century concrete bridge, which carries a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> over the lock chamber. Nearby are the Grade I listed ruins of Louth Abbey, a Cistercian abbey dating from 1139. Willows Lock is also reasonably well preserved, and is of a similar construction to Ticklepenny Lock, as is Salter Fen Lock, although it differs in having a large opening which acts as an overflow in the south-eastern side.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of Fellbarrow is the Vale of Lorton, through which flows the River Cocker. This is a wide {{cultivated}} valley {{with a number of}} small parcels of woodland, the settlement of Thackthwaite lying nearest to the fell. To the west are a number of small streams including Mosser Beck and Cat Gill, which also flow northward and ultimately join the Cocker. This is rolling agricultural land on {{the very edge of the}} Lake District. North of Fellbarrow is the lower top of Hatteringill Head (1,263ft), listed in some guidebooks before the ridge falls away over Whin Fell to a <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> known as Mirk Lane. Fellbarrow also sends out a short ridge north eastward over Broadmoor Hill towards Low Lorton village. The fell is rounded and grassy almost throughout.|$|E
