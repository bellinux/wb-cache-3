40|$|Since the {{inception}} of Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery in the 1930 s, this technique has proved its utility {{in the treatment of}} cutaneous tumors. This review describes the technique of Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery and the various indications for which it is used. We discuss the use of Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery for the following cutaneous tumors: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery is cost effective in the U. S. health care system because billing for the surgeon-pathologist and laboratory processing is bundled together. However, Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery may be more expensive in European systems because the Mohs technique surgeon, pathologist, and laboratory fees may be billed separately...|$|R
40|$|Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery {{has become}} the “gold standard” for {{surgical}} excision of nonmelanoma skin cancers for maximal preservation of normal tissue. Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery entails processing specimens in horizontal frozen sections with immediate examination under a light microscope. This technique offers the examination of lateral and deep margins in the same plane in contrast to wide local excision. Success with Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery depends on accurate mapping of the tumor, correct interpretation of the histopathological sections, and appreciation of aggressive tumor characteristics. The most common reason for recurrence of tumor after Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery is residual undetected tumor. Because hematoxylin and eosin stains may present difficulties in interpretation, immunohistochemistry techniques {{are being used to}} supplement these routine stains. Although immunohistochemistry is not being widely utilized by Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery surgeons, the many advantages of immunohistochemistry over routine staining of frozen sections in selected settings is of great value.

40|$|Background Endocrine mucin–producing {{sweat gland}} {{carcinoma}} {{is a very}} rare cutaneous tumor that has been reported only in three patients previously. We report a case of an endocrine mucin–producing sweat gland carcinoma associated with mucinous carcinoma treated by Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery. Objective The purpose of this report is to test the utility of Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery {{in the treatment of}} mucinous carcinomata. Methods A 79 -year-old female with a 2 -year history of four lesions of biopsy-proven endocrine mucin–producing sweat gland carcinomas and mucinous carcinoma was treated with Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery. Results Three of the lesions were completely cleared by Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery. The fourth lesion, in the right lateral canthus, was not cleared by the Mohs' technique because of its location within the orbit and the difficulty of retraction of the globe for appropriate visualization and excision. The patient underwent wide excision of the remaining orbital tumor and reconstruction, which was successfully accomplished. The patient did not experience a recurrence in any of her four lesions over a 2 -year follow-up period. Conclusion Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery is an appropriate treatment for mucinous carcinomata, including endocrine mucin–producing sweat gland carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} and can be treated in various ways. One treatment modality is Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery. Due to the increasing incidence of skin cancer in the last decades, {{there is a need for}} improvement of the Mohs technique to optimize its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of dermoscopy to guide demarcation of Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery margins and ascertain whether this method can reduce operative time and, therefore, reduce surgical morbidity and cost. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The sample comprised 44 patients who underwent Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery, allocated into two groups: the control group and the intervention group. In the latter, surgical margins were guided by dermoscopy. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups by chi-square analysis (p = 0. 399). CONCLUSION: Although outcomes were similar in the two groups, demonstrating that dermoscopy does not help in the demarcation of surgical margins for Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery, the study provides a practical proposal for improvement of the Mohs technique...|$|R

40|$|Keratoacanthomas are fast-growing, solitary, {{cutaneous}} neoplasms {{that usually}} show spontaneous regression. The development of giant variants and aggressive behavior have been described. Clinically, a keratoacanthoma larger than 20 to 30 mm {{is classified as}} a giant keratoacanthoma. A major challenge in dealing with these neoplasms is the difficulty of clinically and histologically differentiating them from squamous cell carcinoma. The authors report a practical approach using Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery for evaluation of large tumors. With this method, the lateral margins are evaluated and cleared prior to excision of {{the bulk of the}} tumor. The authors also describe alternative therapies for giant keratoacanthomas and present a case of a 61 -year-old woman with a rapidly growing tumor on her left arm. Skin biopsy was consistent with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal features of a keratoacanthoma. The patient underwent Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery using the described approach, and no recurrence has been noted in four years. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for giant keratoacanthomas. Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery is a logical treatment option for giant keratoacanthomas. This case illustrates a useful approach that may prove valuable when treating large specimens during Mohs <b>micrographic</b> surgery...|$|R
