At higher pH of 8. 5, unionised ammonia was high (2473 mg L(- 1)) coincided with poor biogas yield (47 m Ld(- 1)) that confirms ammonia toxicity. By contrast at a pH of 4. 5 the ammonia was minimum (510 mg L(- 1)), but high VFA (26, 803 mg L(- 1)) inhibited the methanogens.

THE CORN STOVER ISSUE The corn sweetener industry is based on processing corn grain (maize), creating value-added products such as glucose, dextrose, and fructose. Conversion of corn stover to sugars has been stymied for years due to cost. Environmental benefits, wider adaptation of sustainable farming practices and the relentless improve-ments in biotechnology are expected to overcome the economic hurdle within the next five years and recast the corn sweetener industry. The corn stover industry uses about 8 % of the corn crop (20 million t) in 1997; the fuel ethanol industry used about 13 million t (515 million bu). These combined demands equal 13 % of domestic demand for corn. Corn stover consists of the stalks, leaves, and cobs remaining aboveground after the corn kernels are harvested. About 1 kg of stover is produced per kg of grain. In 1997 about 200 million dry t of stover was produced. The mass of stover increases with the yield of the corn-expected to increase 1 % to 2 % annually More than 90 % of the stover is left in the fields.

40|$|Combustion {{processes}} {{of any kind}} requirelow-pollution and, at the same time, energy efficient process management. Combustion of fossil fuels {{is relatively easy to}} optimize in this respect as it is characterized by constant fuel properties. On the other hand, renewable fuels, such as biomass, <b>solid</b> <b>municipal</b> waste, <b>solid</b> <b>municipal</b> waste fractions or substitute fuels, have greatly varying chemico-physical properties which may give rise to process behavior both difficult to manage and non-steady in terms of time. To ensure optimum combustion, the parameters of operation therefore must be automatically adapted to the fluctuations in time of combustion conditions. Unfortunately, it is practically impossible to measure fuel properties directly. For this reason, causes must be derived indirectly from fuel-induced changes in measurable quantities. Conventional measurements by means of pyrometers, thermocouples, and offgas probes can detect fuel-induced fluctuations only after some time delay and not in highly sensitive resolution. Often they are not representive of the entire process because they measure only at specific points or, at best, along one line. Because of the restricted possibilities offered by conventional measurement, control adaption is only possible by on-line processing and evaluation of the images produced by cameras. Infrared or video cameras are able to detect the combustion situation quickly without needing any contact or producing any repercussions, and also with the high resolution required. In this way, changes can be detected at an early point in time, and this (additional) information can be used for monitoring or for specific action in combustion control. The article discusses the possibilities available on the basis of infrared and video camera measurements and describes practical uses in grate furnace systems...|$|R

LaPara. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 362 pagesThe development {{of resistance to}} antibiotics among pathogens is a global public health dilemma with significant consequences for the length and quality of human life. As a result, the bacterial antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that confer resistance are increasingly regarded as environmental contaminants. A significant body of knowledge has been generated that catalogues the occurrence of ARGs in numerous environmental reservoirs, among which residual <b>municipal</b> wastewater <b>solids</b> {{are one of the}} largest. Only a handful of studies, however, make the critical paradigm shift to considering treatment technologies and management strategies intended to reduce the quantities of ARGs in those reservoirs. The objective of the work presented here was to evaluate various treatment technologies and management strategies for reducing the quantity of ARGs discharged from the municipal wastewater treatment process during treatment and disposal of residual solids. Aerobic digestion, air drying, and hyperthermophilic (¡Ý 60 ¡ãC) anaerobic digestion were evaluated for their abilities to reduce ARG quantities in residual <b>municipal</b> wastewater <b>solids</b> using laboratory-scale treatment units. The technologies were compared among each other and to mesophilic (40 ¡ãC) and thermophilic (56 ¡ãC) anaerobic digestion {{on the basis of the}} kinetics of ARG removal from residual solids. While all technologies were effective, hyperthermophilic anaerobic digestion tended to exhibit the fastest kinetics. In addition, class 1 integrons were identified as a candidate design gene, and batch or semi-batch flow configurations were demonstrated to be a potential means of optimizing the removal of ARGs from residual solids during aerobic digestion, thermophilic anaerobic digestion, and hyperthermophilic anaerobic digestion. The fate of ARGs in soil following simulated disposal was also investigated by applying treated residual solids from full-scale treatment facilities and from numerous laboratory-scale treatment units to soil microcosms. ARGs from residual solids treated at typical full-scale treatment facilities persisted in soil at high concentrations for relatively long periods of time, with half-lives on the order of months. Alkali stabilization, thermophilic anaerobic digestion, hyperthermophilic anaerobic digestion, and pasteurization, however, caused drastic decreases in ARG quantities in soil within one month. The results presented here can be used to optimize and design the residual <b>municipal</b> wastewater <b>solids</b> treatment and disposal process to remove ARGs...|$|R
