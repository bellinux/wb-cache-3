25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 {{allowed the}} {{creation}} of the tax-exempt real estate <b>mortgage</b> <b>investment</b> conduit (REMIC) special purpose vehicle {{for the express purpose of}} issuing pass-throughs. The Tax Reform Act significantly contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation, encouraging loan origination.|$|E
500|$|Enron used {{special purpose}} entities—limited {{partnerships}} or companies created {{to fulfill a}} temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of [...] "special purpose entities". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt. Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate <b>mortgage</b> <b>investment</b> conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) in the Cochise deal.|$|E

2500|$|Grantor trusts are {{typically}} used in automobile-backed securities and REMICs (Real Estate <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Investment</b> Conduits). [...] Grantor trusts {{are very similar}} to pass-through trusts used in the earlier days of securitization. An originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust, which issues classes of securities backed by these loans. [...] Principal and interest received on the loans, after expenses are taken into account, are passed through to the holders of the securities on a pro-rata basis.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} common {{securitization}} trusts are sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, US government-sponsored enterprises. Ginnie Mae, a US government-sponsored enterprise backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, guarantees that its investors receive timely payments but buys limited numbers of mortgage notes. Some private institutions also securitize mortgages, known as [...] "private-label" [...] mortgage securities. Issuances of private-label mortgage-backed securities increased dramatically from 2001 to 2007 and then ended abruptly in 2008, when real estate markets began to falter. An example of a private-label issuer is the real estate <b>mortgage</b> <b>investment</b> conduit (REMIC), a tax-structure entity usually used for CMOs; among other things, a REMIC structure avoids so-called double taxation.|$|E
2500|$|A mortgage-backed {{security}} (MBS) {{is a type}} of asset-backed {{security that}} is secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that securitizes, or packages, the loans together into a security that investors can buy. The mortgages of an MBS may be residential or commercial, depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or they can be [...] "private-label", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as [...] "pass-through", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, often structured as real estate <b>mortgage</b> <b>investment</b> conduits) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).|$|E
