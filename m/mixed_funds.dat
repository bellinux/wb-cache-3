40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose a {{valuation}} and hedging strategy for a guaranteed minimal rate of return on a <b>mix</b> <b>fund,</b> which participates in both bonds and stocks. For the case where a fixed amount of money is invested, we show that a European put option on the <b>mix</b> <b>fund</b> replicates the cash flows of this guarantee at all times and using the arbitrage-free pricing methodology, the market value of the guarantee can be obtained explicitly. Using historical data, we show that modeling the correlation between equity and bond returns is of fundamental importance when the stochastic nature of the term structure of interest rates is taken into account. For this model we define a hedging strategy which shows how the dependency of the option on the changing yield of the bond fund can be hedged away using <b>mix</b> <b>fund</b> contracts. We also show how Monte Carlo methods can be used to analyze the case where the guarantee is given on periodically invested fixed amounts of money instead of one single payment...|$|R

However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each mutual funds and to compare efficiency between stock mutual funds and fixed-income mutual funds, stock mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual funds and protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> and protected mutual funds, fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> and fixed-income mutual funds and protected mutual funds. There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> twenty-one <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> and nine protected mutual funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income mutual funds and 81. 04 percent in <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds.</b> Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock mutual funds and fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> and protected mutual funds, fixed-income mutual funds and protected mutual funds, and stock mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock mutual funds and protected mutual funds, and fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of the Internet on the {{newspaper}} industry with special emphasis on quality. In pursuing this, I apply a model by Armstrong and Weeds (2007) where I compare the equilibrium outcomes when the competing newspapers are characterized by a <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime (e. g., printed newspapers) versus a pure advertising funding regime (online newspapers). Because costly investment in higher quality can be translated into higher prices to the consumer in the <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime, whereas this is not possible in a pure advertising regime, quality will, in this modelling environment, be higher for printed newspapers than for online newspapers. On the other hand, online newspapers will respond to more fierce competition by increasing quality, while printed newspapers will reduce price and keep quality unchanged. However, there are several limitations to the model. Perhaps most importantly, due to different reading behavior for online news relative to printed newspapers, online advertising has proven less effective compared to its printed counterpart. Hence, advertising revenues per reader is lower in online newspapers than in printed newspapers. Since the gain in advertising revenues by attracting more readers following an increase in quality is small, online newspapers will have weaker incentives to invest in costly quality. I also investigate how news diversity may be affected by going from a <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime to a pure advertising regime. It is clear that for a fixed quality level, online newspapers will have incentives to differentiate themselves minimally from their competitors. Printed newspaper (<b>mixed</b> <b>funding)</b> on the other hand will differentiate themselves to a larger degree as differentiation allows for setting higher prices. However, changing the assumptions, such as endogenous quality and allowing for more newspapers, may give different results. The main conclusion of this thesis is that news quality, measured as costly news production (e. g., ratio of self-produced content, use of multiple sources, investigative journalism), is lower online than in printed newspapers. An implication of this may be a reduction in positive externalities provided by quality news production...|$|R

The paper discusses various properties and characteristics of the optimal stochastic asset-allocation strategy (which we call stochastic lifestyling) both with and without the presence of non-hedgeable salary risk. We compare the performance of stochastic lifestlying with some popular strategies used by pension providers, including deterministic lifestyling (which involves a gradual switch from equities to bonds according to preset rules) and static strategies that invest in benchmark <b>mixed</b> <b>funds.</b> We find that the use of stochastic lifestyling significantly enhances the welfare {{of a wide range of}} potential plan members relative to these other strategies...|$|E

We may conclude that fund managers who want to maximize their AuM (and, if applicable, increase their AuM based fees) must mainly focus their efforts on improving these standard performance measures. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the performance-flow relationship is concave then convex. Indeed, amongst the funds with a negative performance, those achieving the worst results are affected by disproportionately high net outflows whereas, {{on the opposite side of}} the spectrum, the most successful funds experience much higher capital inflows...|$|E

40|$|Background: In Sweden {{mutual funds}} alone account for SEK 1 {{trillion}} as of today. This is a doubling in wealth in only 7 years. For decades {{people have tried}} {{to come up with}} successful trading strategies enabling them to beat the market. Since mutual funds have become popular the research has also started to include ways of finding the right mutual funds. Academics continuously try to find characteristics influencing mutual fund return. Choosing the right mutual funds can have considerable effects on investors’ ending wealth; one percent each year in 30 years can imply a huge amount. Since the influence on accumulated wealth is enormous it would be preferable if fund investors could evaluate managers based on known characteristics influencing return. Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether an investor can find fund attributes influencing return, which can give him indications about future performance. Definition: When mutual funds or funds are used in this thesis only equity mutual funds are considered; accordingly fixed income funds, <b>mixed</b> <b>funds</b> or other special funds are not considered. Methodology: Extensive research exists in our subject of interest; however academics have attained divergent results. In our study hypotheses are defined regarding those attributes most frequently used by finance academics. The hypotheses are being tested by performing several regression analyses, both simple and multiple. By accepting or rejecting the hypotheses we find out if earlier studies, mainly from the U. S., are applicable on Swedish mutual funds. Our empirical data exists of secondary sources mainly collected from each mutual fund’s annual report. Data is also collected from the Six Trust Database and by e-mailing different mutual fund companies. The study covers the period 2000 - 01 - 03 – 2004 - 12 - 31 and only includes mutual funds invested in domestic securities. Data: A huge body of financial articles concerning the subject of mutual fund performance have been studied before performing the study. These articles are mainly derived from the U. S. and financial professionals diverge in their results concerning which attributes that influence return. Result: Our study shows that the attributes having some impact on mutual fund return are risk, size, age and mutual fund tenure.
