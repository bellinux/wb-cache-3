5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading <b>mechanisms.</b> <b>In</b> the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> human color vision) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones.

A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570nm.|$|E

5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E

5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding <b>mechanisms.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, <b>mechanisms</b> <b>in</b> the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E

40|$|Slider-crank <b>mechanisms</b> {{are used}} <b>in</b> many {{machines}} {{where there is}} a need to transform rotary motion into translation, and vice versa. Implementation of the control into a mechanical assembly of the slider-crank mechanism offers a wide range of applications of such controlled <b>mechanism</b> <b>in</b> mechatronic systems. This paper shows an example of the remote control of the angular velocity of the crank in a mechatronic redesigned slider-crank <b>mechanism</b> <b>in</b> order to achieve the desired motion of the slider. The remote control is achieved over the Internet connection and the appropriate software which is executed in the user’s internet browser. The aim of this paper is to present the applied control algorithm as well as to explain advantages of the possibility to remotely run a mechatronic redesigned slider-crank <b>mechanism</b> <b>in</b> service. This is done through an example of using a controlled slider-crank <b>mechanism</b> <b>in</b> a remote laboratory experiment...|$|R
