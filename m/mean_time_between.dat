The <b>mean</b> coalescence <b>time</b> <b>between</b> trajectories scales as a power law {{as a function of the}} numerical precision of the calculations in the contracting and transitions regions of the maps. In the contracting regions the exponent of the power law is approximately one for both maps and it is approximately two in the transition regions for both maps. In the chaotic regions, the <b>mean</b> coalescence <b>time</b> <b>between</b> trajectories scales as an exponential law as a function of the numerical precision of the calculations for the maps.

500|$|As a {{computer}} system grows in complexity, the <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> failures usually decreases. Application checkpointing is a technique whereby the computer system takes a [...] "snapshot" [...] of the application—a record of all current resource allocations and variable states, akin to a core dump—; this information {{can be used to}} restore the program if the computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} general method for the {{derivation}} of various statistical quantities describing {{the detection of}} a beam of atoms emerging from a micromaser. The use of non-normalized conditioned density operators and a linear master equation for the dynamics between detection events is discussed as are the counting statistics, sequence statistics, and waiting time statistics. In particular, we derive expressions for {{the mean number of}} successive detections of atoms in one of any two orthogonal states of the two-level atom. We also derive expressions for the <b>mean</b> waiting <b>times</b> <b>between</b> detections. We show that the <b>mean</b> waiting <b>times</b> <b>between</b> detections of atoms in like states are equivalent to the <b>mean</b> waiting <b>times</b> calculated from the uncorrelated steady state detection rates, though like atoms are indeed correlated. The <b>mean</b> waiting <b>times</b> <b>between</b> detections of atoms in unlike states exhibit correlations. We evaluate the expressions for various detector efficiencies using numerical integration, reporting results for the standard micromaser arrangement in which the cavity is pumped by excited atoms and the excitation levels of the emerging atoms are measured. In addition, the atomic inversion and the Fano-Mandel function for the detection of de-excited atoms is calculated for comparison to the experimental results of Weidinger et al. [1], which reports the first observation of trapping states. ...|$|R
2500|$|High {{reliability}} was required of the D-17B. It controlled a key weapon {{that would have}} just one chance to execute its mission. Reliability of the D-17B was achieved {{through the use of}} solid-state electronics and a relatively simple design. Simpler DRL (diode-resistor) logic was used extensively, but less-reliable DTL (diode-transistor) logic was used only where needed. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the D-17B was designed, transistors lacked today's reliability. DTL provided, however, either gain or inversion. Reliability was also enhanced by the rotating disk memory with non-destructive readout (NDRO).

Once in service, the Viggen's software was regularly updated every 18 months.
