40|$|The {{concept of}} {{uncertainty}} in measurement stems {{from that of}} (probable) error and is intimately intertwined with it. Both concepts {{can be viewed as}} measures of the quality of a measurement or, better, of the corresponding estimate. There is an endless list of misunderstandings, false beliefs, and misinterpretations on this subject. People tend also to use the same word with different meanings. In this paper, while giving an overview of the evolution of the concept, from the initial unawareness of the need for a quality assessment (still present in many areas) to the present views, the author also tries to shed some light and some clarity on the most popular and debated misunderstandings, particularly about the concepts of error, true quantity value(s), and <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>value.</b> The author is the convener of the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology Working Group 1 (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement).

40|$|The {{goals of}} this paper fall into two closely related areas. First, we develop a formal {{framework}} for deterministic unital quantities in which measurement unitization is understood to be a built-in feature of quantities rather than a mere annotation of their numerical values with convenient units. We introduce this idea within the setting of certain ordered semigroups of physical-geometric states of classical physical systems. States are assumed to serve as truth makers of metrological statements about <b>quantity</b> <b>values.</b> A unital <b>quantity</b> is presented as an isomorphism from the target system’s ordered semigroup of states to that of positive reals. This framework allows us to include various derived and variable quantities, encountered in engineering and the natural sciences. For illustration and ease of presentation, we use the classical notions of length, time, electric current and mean velocity as primordial examples. The most important application of the resulting unital quantity calculus is in dimensional analysis. Second, in evaluating measurement uncertainty due to the analog-to-digital conversion of the <b>measured</b> <b>quantity’s</b> <b>value</b> into its <b>measuring</b> instrument’s pointer <b>quantity</b> <b>value,</b> we employ an ordered semigroup framework of pointer states. Pointer states encode the measuring instrument’s indiscernibility relation, manifested by {{not being able to}} distinguish the measured system’s topologically proximal states. Once again, we focus mainly on the measurement of length and electric current quantities as our motivating examples. Our approach to quantities and their measurement is strictly state-based and algebraic in flavor, rather than that of a representationalist-style structure-preserving numerical assignment...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{time and}} {{resources}} are used to determine the quality of goods and services. As a consequence, the quality of measurements themselves, e. g., the metrological traceability of the <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>values</b> is essential to allow a proper evaluation of the results with regard to specifications and regulatory limits. This requires knowledge of the measurement uncertainties of all <b>quantity</b> <b>values</b> involved in the measurement procedure, including measurement standards. This study shows how the uncertainties due to the preparation, as well as the chemical and compositional stability of a chemical measurement standard, or calibrator, can be estimated. The results show that the relative standard uncertainty of the concentration value of a typical analytical measurement standard runs up to 2. 8 % after 1 year. Of this, 1. 9 % originates from the preparation of the measurement standard, while 2. 0 and 0. 53 % originate from the chemical and compositional stability during storage at - 20 A degrees C. The monthly preparation of working calibrators stored at 4 A degrees C and used on a weekly basis, results in an additional standard uncertainty of the analyte concentration value of 0. 35 % per month due to compositional stability. While the preparation procedure is the major contributor to the total measurement uncertainty, the uncertainties introduced by the stability measurements are another important contributor, and therefore, the measurement procedure to evaluate stability is important to minimize the total measurement uncertainty...|$|R

The theory is applied to observational data obtained during a series of VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) experiments conducted between stations at Rosman, North Carolina, and Mojave, California, using the ATS- 3 satellite as a radio source.

40|$|The {{sources of}} the systematical {{uncertainties}} due to radiative correction procedure in measurements of the structure function g n 1 with 3 He target are considered. Their numerical estimations are presented. The relative systematical uncertainty does not exceed 5 %. The measurements of the spin-dependent structure functions performed {{in the last years}} (SMC, E 154 / 155) have the tendency to decrease essentially the statistical uncertainties comparing with previous ones (EMC, E 142 / 143). Thus the one of main problem is to decrease the magnitude of the systematical uncertainties or define more correct way of their calculation. In general systematical uncertainties come from <b>measured</b> <b>quantities,</b> namely: <b>values</b> of the beam and target polarizations, efficiencies of the coordinate detectors etc. There are also some contributions in total systematic uncertainty due to unmeasured quantities such as radiative corrections (RC) to be applied to extract the one-photon exchange cross section from the measured one.

40|$|Consistency of {{observed}} oceanographic salinity data {{is discussed}} {{with respect to}} contemporary metrological concepts. The claimed small uncertainty of salinity measurement results traceable to the conductivity ratio of a certified IAPSO Standard Seawater reference is not metrologically justified if results are compared on climatic time scales. This applies in particular to Practical Salinity SP, Reference Salinity SR, and the latest estimates of Absolute Salinity using the TEOS- 10 formalism. In climate time scales an additional contribution to the uncertainty that is related to unknown property changes of the reference material must be accounted for. Moreover, when any of these <b>measured</b> or calculated <b>quantity</b> <b>values</b> is used to estimate Absolute Salinity of a seawater sample under investigation, another uncertainty contribution is required to quantify {{the accuracy of the}} equations relating the actually <b>measured</b> <b>quantity</b> to the Absolute Salinity. Without accounting for these additional uncertainties, such results cannot be used to estimate Absolute Salinity with respect to the International System of Units (SI), i. e. to the unit chosen for the mass fraction of dissolved material in the sample, which is "g/kg". From a metrological point of view, such deficiencies in the calculations involving other quantities will produce SI-incompatible results. We outline how these problems can be overcome by linking salinity to primary SI measurement standards...|$|R

The physical processes of the energy transfer from the arc to the anode are discussed qualitatively...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{measured}} {{the economic impact}} of increased consumption of locally grown foods, and many advocates have set goals for increasing consumption of locally grown foods to a given percentage. In this paper, we first apply previously developed methods to the state of Vermont, to <b>measure</b> the <b>quantity</b> and <b>value</b> of food that would be consumed if the USDA Dietary Guidelines were followed. We also assess the potential of locally grown foods to meet these guidelines, finding that meeting dietary guidelines with a local, seasonal diet would bring economic benefit, in this case, US$ 148 million in income for Vermont farmers. A missing piece of information has been: what is the current percentage of locally grown food being consumed in a given city, state, or region? The Farm to Plate Strategic Plan, a 10 - year plan for strengthening Vermont’s food system, attempted to answer this question. To date, we know of no credible set of methods to precisely measure the percentage of food consumed that is locally grown. We collect data {{from a variety of sources}} to estimate current local consumption of food. We were able to measure and account for about US$ 52 million in local food expenditures, equal to about 2. 5 % of all food expenditures in Vermont. We then discuss limitations and suggestions for improving measurement methods moving forward...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} which {{was developed and}} investigated for the SMOS spaceborne imaging radiometer to be launched end of 2007. SMOS is an L-band Y-shaped aperture synthesis radiometer intended for global measurements of soil moisture and ocean salinity. Since the directly <b>measured</b> <b>quantities</b> are correlation <b>values</b> in the spatial frequency domain, a calibration procedure has to transform them to brightness temperatures, which are the typical radiometer output signals and specified as the SMOS level- 1 data products. Furthermore, the imperfect system response has to be corrected, for which some on-board implemented hardware tools are available. However, those are only able to correct part of the errors and, typically, the residual imperfections are more expensive to eliminate. Finally the map of correlation values has to be converted to an image in the spatial domain in order to assign the determined geophysical data to their corresponding geographical location. The here proposed image reconstruction and calibration approach {{is based on the}} in-space measurements of well-known calibration targets like point sources in a low-power background as it could be provided by the Moon and the deep space. The use of multiple scenes, where the point-source is located on different positions within the usable field of view, allows the determination of a G matrix describing the whole imperfect system. Once determined, the matrix can be used to compute efficiently the corrected and calibrated brightness temperature map of the actually observed scene. Simulation results for various realistic conditions in order to assess the performance of the approach are shown and discussed. ...|$|R
