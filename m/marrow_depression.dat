25|$|Sulfur mustard {{was used}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in World War I and more recently in the Iran–Iraq War. Sulfur mustard is a vesicant alkylating agent with strong cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. After exposure, victims show skin irritations and blisters. This agent also causes respiratory tract lesions, bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression,</b> and eye damage, the epithelial tissues of these organs being predominately affected. Inhalation of high doses of this gas causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi with inflammatory reactions and necrosis. The alkylating agent affects more the upper parts of the respiratory tract, and only intensely exposed victims showed signs like bronchiolitis obliterans in the distal part. Secondary effects of sulfur mustard exposure lead to chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis.|$|E
30|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is {{a severe}} connective tissue disease of unknown etiology. SSc {{is characterized by}} multivisceral fibrosis resulting from inflammation, vascular injury and excessive collagen deposition. Skin sclerosis can cause discomfort and organ involvements—such as pulmonary fibrosis—can be fatal. However, the mechanisms of fibrosis in SSc have not been fully elucidated and effective drugs are still scarce (Walker et al. 2012). Immunosuppressants, used to treat SSc, can also cause important adverse effects, such as hepatic and renal functional lesion, bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depressions</b> and infecting etc. Therefore, new therapy options need to be found.|$|R

5000|$|Mass {{casualties}} {{occurred in}} the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s when Fusarium-contaminated wheat flour was baked into bread, causing alimentary toxic aleukia with a 60% mortality rate. Symptoms began with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and prostration, and within days, fever, chills, myalgias and bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> with granulocytopenia and secondary sepsis occurred. Further symptoms included pharyngeal or laryngeal ulceration and diffuse bleeding into the skin (petechiae and ecchymoses), melena, bloody diarrhea, hematuria, hematemesis, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, pancytopenia and gastrointestinal ulceration. Fusarium sporotrichoides contamination was found in affected grain in 1932, spurring research for medical purposes and for use in biological warfare. The active ingredient {{was found to be}} trichothecene T-2 mycotoxin, and it was produced in quantity and weaponized prior to the passage of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. The Soviets were accused of using the agent, dubbed [...] "yellow rain", to cause 6,300 deaths in Laos, Kampuchea, and Afghanistan between 1975 and 1981.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of developing bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> and infections during azathioprine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with low or absent thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity have {{an increased}} risk of developing myelotoxicity. We describe a patient who developed pancytopenia combined with cytomegalovirus pneumonia after several years of azathioprine use. The bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> was probably caused by the viral infection, as all others causative factors were unlikely. Surprisingly, we observed grossly elevated TPMT activity (182 nmol/g/h) during the recovery phase, following the pancytopenic period. After complete recovery of the bone marrow suppression, TPMT activity returned to usual reference activity (43 nmol/g/h). This remarkable change in enzymatic activity of TPMT may be explained by differences in the age of red blood cells, as younger erythrocytes have a higher TPMT activity. Determination of a patient's TPMT status by phenotyping should therefore not be performed just after bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> or in cases of activated erythropoiese...|$|E
40|$|Benzene affects hematopoietic {{progenitor}} cells {{leading to}} bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> and genotoxic effects such as micronucleus fonnation. Progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation are inhibited by prostaglandins produced by macrophages. Administration of benzene to DBA/ 2 or C 57 BL/ 6 mice caused a dose-dependent bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> {{and a significant}} increase in marrow prostaglandin E level and both were prevented by the coadministration of indomethacin and other inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase component of prostaglandin H synthase. Levels of benzene that decreased bone marrow cellularity also caused genotoxic effects measured as increased micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in peripheral blood, which was also prevented by the coadministration of indomethacin. These results suggest a possible role for prostaglandin synthase in benzene myelotoxicity; a mechanism by which this might occur is presented...|$|E

40|$|Autologous marrow was {{collected}} from patients with acute leukemia {{during their first}} remission, and cryopreserved. In relapse, four of the patients were treated with remission-induction chemotherapy more intensive than the pre-vious treatment, followed by infusion of the cryopreserved autologous marrow.

All four patients achieved a second complete remission, but with no maintenance therapy leukemic relapses were observed in three of them. One patient survived without leukemic relapse for 19 months, 13 months longer than the previous remission period. Another effect of autoinfusion was reduction in blood products required during the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression.</b> These observations suggest that cryopreserved autologous marrow may retain its hemopoietic activity and autologous marrow infusion may be effective in providing early recovery or rescue from bone marrow failure...|$|E

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical study}} {{of patients with}} advanced epithelial ovarian cancer after debulking surgery showed that high-dose (120 mg/m 2) cis-platinum (DDP) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m 2) had a significantly higher response and survival rate than the low-dose DDP (60 mg/m 2) and cyclophosphamide combination. The 3 -year actuarial survival rate of the high-dose group was 60 % {{and that of the}} low-dose group was 30 %. Though moderate to severe marrow toxicity was evident in 80 % of the patients in the high-dose group and 40 % of the low-dose group, no serious sepsis or death developed {{as a result of the}} <b>marrow</b> <b>depression.</b> Mild neurotoxicity was observed in 55 % of the patients in the high-dose group and only 20 % in the low-dose group.

40|$|In man, {{chloramphenicol}} (CAP), induces {{two major}} haemotoxic effects. First, a reversible, dose-related reticulocytopenia and anaemia developing during treatment. Second, a non-dose-related aplastic anaemia (AA), developing weeks after treatment, is often irreversible and fatal. In previous studies, {{we developed a}} mouse model of the reversible reticulocytopenia/anaemia using CAP succinate (CAPS); attempts to induce AA in the mouse with CAPS were unsuccessful; in the rat, CAPS induced only minimal haemotoxicity. We therefore wished to investigate haematological changes caused by CAPS in a third rodent, particularly {{in relation to the}} induction of significant ‘late stage’ bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> (AA). Female guinea pigs were gavaged with CAPS in three experiments. In a dose ranging study, CAPS (at 2500 and 3500 mg/kg) was administered daily for 9 days, and blood examined at 1 day post dosing. CAPS induced increased erythrocyte values (an apparent haemoconcentration effect), and reduced reticulocytes and femoral marrow nucleated cell counts (FNCC). In a second experiment, CAPS was given at 333, 666 and 1000 mg/kg (13 days); haematological changes were compared with results from the initial study, with evidence of dose-related effects. In a final experiment, CAPS was administered (825 mg/kg, 16 days) and blood studied at 1, 12, 28 and 63 days post dosing. At day 1, erythrocyte values were decreased (NS), and reticulocytes and FNCC were reduced; the marrow was hypocellular with erythroid depletion. At 12 and 28 days, values returned towards the normal range. At 63 days, parameters were normal. Thus, CAPS (825 mg/kg for 16 days) induced changes comparable to the reversible bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression</b> seen in man; but {{there was no evidence of}} ‘late stage’ (i. e. at 63 days) <b>marrow</b> <b>depression,</b> as would be seen in a developing or overt marrow aplasia (AA).

40|$|Although most {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} known to cause primarily reduction or suppression of immune responses, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the influence of cytostatic agents on lymphoid tissue compartments such as the splenic marginal zone. The marginal zone plays an important role in the defence against encapsulated bacteria, which are potential candidates for postchemotherapeutic infections. We studied the effect of three different cytostatic agents (cisplatin, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide) on B cell subpopulations in a rat model. Rats received a single dose of a single cytostatic agent and were sacrificed at different time points after treatment. Bone marrow, blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were analysed by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. All three cytostatic agents showed severe bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression.</b> CP and MTX showed only mild reduction of cell populations in the spleen. CyPh showed a severe reduction of recirculating follicular B (RF-B) cells and marginal zone B (MZ-B) cells. At day 24 most populations were already recovered, but RF-B cells and MZ-B cells were still reduced. The reduction of the marginal zone and late recovery may imply that, beside the overall increased infection risk due to neutropenia, patients treated with chemotherapy are at risk for developing infections from encapsulated bacteria for a considerable period of time after treatment, extending beyond the period of bone <b>marrow</b> <b>depression...</b>|$|E
