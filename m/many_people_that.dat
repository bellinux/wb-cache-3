5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time the secret treaty was {{published}} in the Semanario, a Paraguayan weekly paper, and had the effect of convincing <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> López was right in making this war upon the Allies, and that Paraguay was compelled to fight for her very existence.|$|E
25|$|Broadnax {{recovered}} (although she ultimately {{suffered the}} effects {{for the rest}} of her life, and received some support from Jefferson). Broadnax told <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> she had seen Sweeney put a powder in their morning coffee. Other black witnesses saw Sweeney drop paper from the jail, which appeared to contain rat poison. However, both trial judges agreed that Virginia race laws prohibited blacks from testifying at the trial.|$|E
25|$|In {{the series}} of Fox Telecolombia, Alias El Mexicano (2013) by Diego Mejía and Monica Botero, Colonel Ramírez keeps his same real name and he is {{performed}} by actor Rafael Novoa.

25|$|According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), {{getting as}} many girls vaccinated as early and {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} will reduce the cases of cervical cancer among middle-aged women in 30 to 40 years and reduce the transmission of this highly communicable infection. Barriers include the limited understanding by <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> HPV causes cervical cancer, the difficulty of getting pre-teens and teens into the doctor's office to get a shot, and the high cost of the vaccine ($120/dose, $360 total for the three required doses, plus the cost of doctor visits). Community-based interventions can increase the uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The {{planchette}} {{is guided}} by unconscious muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or planchette) is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> spirits are truly at work... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state {{is one in which}} consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual's normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.|$|E
25|$|With {{the widely}} used {{alternative}} of penal transportation halted in the 1770s, the immediate {{need for additional}} penal accommodations emerged. Given the undeveloped institutional facilities, old sailing vessels, termed hulks, were the most readily available and expandable choice {{to be used as}} places of temporary confinement. While conditions on these ships were generally appalling, their use and the labor thus provided set a precedent which persuaded <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> mass incarceration and labour were viable methods of crime prevention and punishment. The turn of the 19th century would see the first movement toward Prison reform, and by the 1810s, the first state prisons and correctional facilities were built, thereby inaugurating the modern prison facilities available today.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> he was getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but {{was careful not to}} be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E
25|$|From the start, the new {{library was}} {{intended}} to be the focus of a large-scale mixed-use development which involved {{the creation of a new}} pedestrianised piazza and the reinstatement as a through route of Jubilee Street, severed when the surrounding derelict land became a makeshift car park. (The street was laid out in the 1840s across Jubilee Field, so named when a wealthy resident's free party for the town's poor people to celebrate George III's Jubilee in 1809 brought in so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> they spilled out of the Royal Pavilion stables and on to the adjacent field.) The name Jubilee Library was chosen to reflect this; a councillor's suggestion of Thabo Mbeki Library, in reference to the then incumbent South African President's period of study at the University of Sussex, was rejected.|$|E
25|$|Though {{his mother}} favored his {{retirement}} from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's {{close friend and}} adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that Roosevelt continue his political career. Roosevelt convinced <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again. He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs by swiveling his torso, supporting himself with a cane. He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability. However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became {{a major part of}} his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, the Social Democratic Party split, and as {{a result}} they {{suffered}} a huge loss in the 1995 parliamentary elections. While in theory the coalition government maintained its majority, it only consisted of one seat. Davíð Oddsson therefore decided to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The leader of the Progressive Party, Halldór Ásgrímsson, became Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the new government, privatisation was continued on a much greater scale than before: a big and important chain of fish processing plants was sold; part-public or public investment funds were merged and sold as a private investment bank; the two commercial banks under government control were sold in a few stages; The two coalition parties accepted the loud demand by <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> a charge would be imposed on the holders of fishing quotas.|$|E

Đôn was equally emphatic, saying [...] "I can state without equivocation that this was done by General Dương Văn Minh and by him alone."

[...] The film does not reference Viper's comic book history {{as an agent of}} Hydra, due to rights issues with Marvel Studios.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all historians {{agree that}} the Dvals were not Alans.

500|$|Sura Wood of The Hollywood Reporter {{called it}} [...] "an intelligent, moving film steeped in an {{authentic}} {{sense of time}} and place." [...] Her sentiments were echoed by Joe Leydon of Variety, who thought Drum was [...] "an intelligent and affecting take on political radicalization in 1950s Johannesburg." [...] According to Film Threat's Jeremy Matthews, Drum was [...] "a solid work of classical storytelling." [...] He observed that it was [...] "heartbreaking in its portrayal of Johannesburg {{at a time when}} its rulers had convinced <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> whites were born to command and blacks were born to obey and serve." ...|$|E
500|$|He was diffident by nature: Flora Litvinova {{has said}} he was [...] "completely {{incapable}} of saying 'No' to anybody." [...] This meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements, including a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in 1973; {{on the other hand}} he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of the Composers' Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet. Oleg Prokofiev commented that [...] "he tried to help so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that...</b> less and less attention was paid to his pleas." [...] When asked if he believed in God, Shostakovich said [...] "No, and I am very sorry about it." ...|$|E

What distinguished the UVA story from anything else ever reported was that the assault did not involve drugs or alcohol, required elaborate planning, and involved so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the perps could not have reasonably expected to get away with it—a confluence of factors that caused the allegations to have substantially more in common with ones that ultimately proved to be false, like the Duke lacrosse case and Tawana Brawley incident.|$|E
