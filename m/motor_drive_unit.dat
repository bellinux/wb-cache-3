50|$|In {{a typical}} {{diverter}} switch powerful springs are tensioned by a low power motor (<b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a vacuum bottle contact in parallel with the diverter switch. During a tap change operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the diverter switch contacts.|$|E

40|$|A dc {{brushless}} <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> mixer <b>unit</b> (a vaneaxial fan) {{was designed}} and evaluated for use in cryogenic fluids (liquids and gases).

The test fluids were liquid and gaseous helium, hydrogen in the liquid phase gas phase and mixtures of the two phases, and liquid nitrogen. It operated for over 100 hr at cryogenic temperatures without damage to the bearings and at the conclusion of testing the condition of the bearings was such that an operational life of 5000 hr appeared possible. The unit demonstrated that (with the brushless dc motor principle) useful pumping of cryogenic fluids could be accomplished with very small power inputs to the mixer motor. During test, the motor input power varied from approximately 0. 5 W to 2. 5 W, depending on fluid density. The high power input produced a mixer efficiency of over 49 percent. In an earlier program (see NASA Report CR- 72365), a mixer using an ac induction motor demonstrated an efficiency of 17. 7 percent under the same conditions, illustrating the advantage of the dc brushless <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> <b>unit.</b> The mixer also demonstrated its ability to automatically vary speed {{as a function of the}} density of the fluid being pumped.

40|$|In modern {{installations}} vertical crystallisers are now preferred over traditional horizontal units {{because of}} the significant benefits they offer, which include larger volumes and smaller floor space, suitability for outdoor installation, higher cooling surface to volume ratios and a better ability to handle highly viscous massecuite, amongst others. Since the first vertical crystallisers were introduced, nearly 40 years ago, {{there has been a}} steady increase in their unit size from initial volumes in the 50 to 200 m 3 range up to the present day where the most general unit size is now in the 300 to 400 m 3 range, with even larger units becoming increasingly common.

40|$|The {{importance}} of viscosity in determining plasma flow structures {{has been widely}} recognized. In laboratory plasmas, however, viscosity measurements have been seldom performed so far. In this paper we present and discuss an estimation method of effective plasma kinematic viscosity utilizing flow velocity field measurements. Imposing steady and axisymmetric conditions, we derive the expression for radial flow velocity from the azimuthal component of the ion fluid equation. The expression contains kinematic viscosity, vorticity of azimuthal rotation and its derivative, collision frequency, azimuthal flow velocity and ion cyclotron frequency. Therefore all quantities except the viscosity are given provided that the flow field can be measured. We applied this method to a rotating magnetized argon plasma produced by the Hyper-I device. The flow velocity field measurements were carried out using a directional Langmuir probe installed in a tilting <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> The inward ion flow in radial direction, which is not driven in collisionless inviscid plasmas, was clearly observed.

Spores were formulated in an oil emulsion and applied using a <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> spray <b>unit.</b> Surface temperatures of selected animals were monitored, as were the ambient temperature and relative humidity.

A significant reduction in egg production was recorded for engorged ticks collected in the 3 days post-treatment.

An electrical line connecting a dc power supply to <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> and sensor <b>units</b> is used for transmit-ting data {{as well as for}} delivering the dc power. Unlike conventional ac power line communication, the dc power bus has predictable noise and impedance characteristics that allow for large fanout and high bandwidth. First, the basic architecture of the dc power line communication is presented. Then, a design of a high-fanout mo-dem that uses a Guanella-type transmission line transformer (TLT) is presented. The serial windings and special resonance character-istics of the TLT coupled with a capacitor are exploited to minimize attenuation in high-fanout systems.
