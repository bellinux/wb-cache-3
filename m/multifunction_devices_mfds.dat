The procedure {{is to be used}} to obtain and evaluate the TEC of Standard-size IE products such as copiers, digital duplicators, fax machines, <b>multifunction</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>MFDs),</b> and printers that use high-temperature technologies such as Electrophotography (EP) and Solid Ink (SI), and those that provide comparable functionality.

40|$|According to the U. S. Department of Energy, {{electricity}} use by non-PC commercial office equipment {{is growing at}} an annual rate of nearly 5 percent (AEO 2003). To help address this growth in consumption, U. S. EPA periodically updates its ENERGY STAR specifications as products and markets change. This report presents background research conducted to help EPA update the ENERGY STAR specification for imaging equipment, which covers printers, fax machines, copiers, scanners, and <b>multifunction</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>MFDs).</b> We first estimated the market impact of the current ENERGY STAR imaging specification, finding over 90 percent of the current market complies with the specification. We then analyzed a sample of typical new imaging products, including 11 faxes, 57 printers and 19 copiers/MFD. For these devices we metered power levels in the most common modes: active/ready/sleep/off, and recorded features that would most likely affect energy consumption. Our metering indicates that for many products and speed bins, current models consume substantially less power than the current specification. We also found that for all product categories, power consumption varied most considerably across technology (i. e. inkjet vs. laser). Although inkjet printers consumed less energy than laser printers in active, ready and sleep-mode, they consumed more power on average while off, mostly due to the use of external power supplies. Based on these findings, we developed strategies for the ENERGY STAR program to achieve additional energy reductions. Finally, we present an assessment of manufacturer's ENERGY STAR labeling practices...|$|E

30|$|Though the above-reported {{absorbers}} and polarization converters {{are very}} efficient, these devices are a single function. They are not accommodated with terahertz systems that require portable, compact, and multi-functional devices. Therefore, multi-functional <b>devices</b> (<b>MFDs)</b> are significant. In this research, an MFD, capable of switching between absorption mode and polarization conversion mode, is proposed. The proposed MFD has a low-profile and simple structure by assembling a gold-based polarization conversion metasurface (PCM) and a graphene-based absorbing metasurface (AM). Then, by setting the chemical potential of graphene μc[*]=[*] 0  eV, the AM is neutralized and the PCM plays a dominant role, and the device rotates the polarization of an incident EM wave. By setting μc =[*] 0.7  eV, the AM takes the main role and the device absorbs the incident EM wave.|$|R

40|$|Intuitive myoelectric {{prosthesis}} control is difcult to achieve {{due to the}} absence of proprioceptive feedback, which forces the user to monitor grip pressure by visual information. Existing myo-electric hand prostheses form a single degree of freedom pincer motion that inhibits the stable prehension of a range of objects. Multi-axis hands may address this lack of functionality, but as with <b>multifunction</b> <b>devices</b> in general, serve to increase the cognitive burden on the user. Intelligent hierarchical control of multiple degree-of-freedom hand prostheses has been used to reduce the need for visual feedback by automating the grasping process. This paper presents a hybrid controller that has been developed to enable different prehensile functions to be initiated directly from the user’s myoelectric signal. A digital signal processor (DSP) regulates the grip pressure of a new six-degree-of-freedom hand prosthesis thereby ensuring secure prehension without continuous visual feedback...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The dynamic voltage restorer(DVR) is a <b>multifunction</b> <b>device</b> used in {{distribution}} system to control voltage disturbances. In this paper, a multifunctional DVR protects the load voltage by posi-cast and P+ Resonant controllers when {{the source of}} disturbance is the parallel feeders. This posi-cast and P+ Resonance controllers improve the transient response and eliminate the steady state error in DVR response, respectively. The DVR acts as a virtual impedance with the main aim of protecting the Point of common coupling (PCC) voltage during downstream fault. The proposed algorithm is applied to some disturbances in load voltage caused by induction motors starting, and a three-phase short circuit fault. Also, the capability of the proposed DVR has been tested to limit the downstream fault current.
