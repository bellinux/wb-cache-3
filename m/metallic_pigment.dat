Corrosion of reinforced steel in concrete structures is a significant problem for NASA structures at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) because of the close proximity of the structures to salt spray from the nearby Atlantic Ocean. In an effort to minimize the damage to such structures, coatings were developed that could be applied as liquids to the external surfaces of a substrate in which the metal structures were embedded. The <b>Metallic</b> <b>Pigment</b> Powder Particle technology was developed by NASA at KSC. This technology combines the metallic materials into a uniform particle.

40|$|The {{coloring}} {{of plastics}} {{is essential in}} parts design and in the promotion of new products. As such, <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> are used to color plastics aiming to replace the appearance of metals. However, the metallic look in plastics {{by the addition of}} <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> prone the visual appearance of weld lines and flow lines. These defects are caused by the anisotropic character of flake like <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> when there is the meeting of two flow fronts or there are melt flow disturbances caused when holes or castles are present in the part. There are some solutions to overcome this problem, but there are also numerous variables that constrain the elimination of these defects. Therefore, the coloration of plastics should be taken into account in part design. The number of gates, its position and type, abrupt changes in wall thickness and improper wall angles influence the melt flow, which in turn allows these defects. The effect of the amount, size and shape of the metallic particles in the appearance of weld lines and flow lines has been studied. Larger size of metallic particle and spherical/rounded particles attenuate these defects. However, the solution may consist in optimizing the injection process and in the appropriate selection of metallic particles or otherwise can even be necessary changing the mold design. This work aims at studying the influence of the physical characteristics of the <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> (size and shape of the particles) on the aesthetic appearance of defects and on the optimization of the processing conditions to minimize the defects caused by the use of metallic particles.

50|$|The initial {{application}} of any paint or varnish is similarly {{absorbed into the}} substrate, but because stains contain lower amounts of binder, the binder from a stain resides mainly below the surface while the pigment remains near the top or at the surface.

40|$|Powder coating, which {{utilizes}} {{polymer resin}} based powder, {{is a relatively}} young technology for decorative and protective purposes. It was first developed in the early 1950 s and gradually grew into automotive finishes. Compared to conventional liquid coating, powder coating is an environmentally friendly technology, given {{that there is no}} emission of harmful solvent throughout the entire operating process. It is also much more efficient, economical and energy saving {{as a result of the}} capability to reuse all the powder. However, there are still some problems in the powder coating process limiting its application. This thesis focused on studying some key aspects of the manufacturing and application processes of both coarse powder and fine powder. Several new techniques were developed during the process. The study started with an investigation of powder coating manufacturing processes. Most of the production is aiming at maximizing the productivity, while the produced powder has a wide particle size distribution, leading to a poor surface condition. In order to narrow the particle size distribution, a new design of classifying cyclone for an air classifying mill (ACM) with a reversed air inlet was studied. Experimental results indicated that this novel cyclone design could effectively reduce the span of the particle size distribution, without deteriorating the collection efficiency compared to conventional cyclones. In addition, the spraying properties of powder coatings were investigated during electrostatic spraying. In order to overcome the Faraday Cage effect, a modified corona spray gun with a multi-electrode design supplied by an alternating charging pattern was invented. Experimental results demonstrated that the Faraday Cage effect could be significantly mitigated by using the new spray gun at various gun voltages. Besides, the new design of spray gun could provide higher transfer efficiency compared to its conventional counterpart. Moreover, this study also improved the powder coating processing technique involving <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments.</b> To achieve better bonding between <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> and powder coating particles, a liquid bonding agent (bonder) was introduced into the blending process. It was found that the concentration of <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> changed minutely from the pre-sprayed and post-sprayed powder, indicating that the recycled powder could be reused. Therefore, this new bonding method of utilizing liquid bonder could provide a strong affinity between the powder coating and <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> so as to prevent separation of the two materials during spraying. At the end, a pre-heating method of applying powder coating onto thermoplastic substrates, which helps powder deposition and adhesion onto plastic substrates, was studied. Three widely used powder coatings have been tested for this method. The coating films were evaluated by both visual inspection and instrumental measurements. It was found that this new processing method could provide a smooth surface as well as a strong adhesion to the difficult substrate. Furthermore, for the purpose of protecting the thermoplastic substrate from deformation during the curing process, a UWO low-cure method was applied to these three powder coatings. Compared with commercial low-cure powder, the UWO low-cure coatings perform better in a few aspects. The discoveries and analysis in this thesis work are contributing to powder coating development. Several original techniques have been invented in this study and they could provide a good guideline for future work of modern powder coating technology...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{significance}} {{and nature of}} the object, analyses were restricted to non-sampling techniques. They were performed at the temporary off-site location of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Examination and time for the analyses was limited to approximately 5  days of Raman, 3  days of XRF analysis and 2  days of infrared imaging. For efficiency, locations of the colors of interest on each illumination were identified prior to transport to the Straus Center. Each passage of interest was examined with a stereomicroscope immediately prior to analysis, so that each pigment and colorant of interest were investigated. As Raman identifies specific molecules or compounds, it was performed first on all illuminations. Pigments that did not yield good Raman data were noted and then analyzed at a later date with XRF. XRF analysis was used in preference to Raman in areas suspected to have <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments,</b> such as gold and silver, to provide elemental information. Additional XRF analysis was conducted at the Weissman Preservation Center, as mentioned above.|$|R
30|$|The {{nature of}} the binder used with the {{pigments}} remains somewhat elusive. In part, this reflects the need to remove a small sample for FTIR analysis, and to follow this with additional analytical techniques such as gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GCMS) or matrix assisted laser desorbtion ionization (MALDI) for definitive identification. FTIR analysis of {{a small number of}} samples from works spanning the 14 th to 17 th century (from Table  1, # 4, 10, 15, 19, 27, 31, 32, 33) indicated gum-based binder in all samples, with only the occasional presence of minor proteinaceous material. All identification is currently based on FTIR analysis alone but work is on-going to improve characterization of the binders from a wider range of folios. Although it has been proposed that use of gum-arabic only began {{at the end of the}} 16 th century [2, 14, 18], 13 th to 19 th century recipes indicate mixing of pigment with gum-arabic for preparation and use, with only rare mention of egg or glue [6]. The exception is for <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> for which glue was recommended [6]. This dominance of gum-arabic is consistent with the presence of gum in all samples analyzed to date.

40|$|Traditional {{powder coating}} {{provides}} poor coating appearance. Fine powder coating can overcome this drawback since the smaller powder particles lead to much smoother finish. Nevertheless, fine powder has been experienced to cause more application problems. This study investigated fine powder coatings from different aspects and it provided solutions {{to solve these}} application problems. The investigation on fine powders conducted by this study concluded that the medium particle size and D 10 was not suitable for the flowability characterization of fine powder coatings. Instead, an index which represented the particle size distribution could correlate with the flowabilities of the fine powder coatings much better. In addition, several processing methods were developed {{for the production of}} fine powder coatings. The experiments disclosed that the revised designs of the cyclone and the grinder could obtain narrower particle size distribution of the powder coatings, which was desired. In addition, other performances of the processes were not sacrificed. The spraying method of powder coatings was also investigated in this study. The additional moisture on the surfaces of the fine powder particles was found to reduce the resistivity of the powder so as to enhance the transfer efficiency during the corona spraying. On the other hand, a new spray gun design with alternative charging pattern could reduce the Faraday Cage effect during corona spraying of fine powders. In addition, it also showed large potential on improving the transfer efficiency of coarse powders. Finally, new processing techniques for functional powder coatings were developed. Utilization of dry blended catalysts could solve the problems of pre-curing and short shelf life associated with the conventional low-cure powder coatings. Other than that, the complicated heat-blending process for processing metallic color powder coatings can be replaced by a new bonding technique with utilization of liquid bonder. The strong bond between powder particles and <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> provided by this new technique can solve the recyclability problem of the metallic color powder coatings during spraying. The discoveries from the thesis study contribute to further understandings of powder coatings.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the stages and the operations {{involved in the}} preservation and restoration of two icons on wooden support, from the XIX-th century, which {{are part of the}} heritage of the ”Sfinții Arhangheli Mihail and Gavriil” church, from Galați. The two icon have inventory numbers as part of the collection as followed: 112 for the first icon and 113 for the second one. Both icons have the same theme, ”The Grieving Mother from Rohia” and are made by anonymous painters in egg tempera, on lime wooden support, without ground. Being part of the same collection, they were deposited in the same place and as a direct consequence, they suffer from similar deteriorations and degradations that affect both the support and the painting layer. Both panels are attacked by xylophagous insects and the painting layer has detachments, gaps, cracks, clogged dirt and a cracked and degraded varnish layer. Ten samples taken from the already detached areas were analyzed by optical microscope, SEM-EDX and micro-FTIR. Based on the chemical elements identified in the EDX spectrums, the pigments used to create the painting layer are: ultramarine natural blue Na 8 - 10 Al 6 Si 6 O 24 S 2 - 4, carbon black, earth green, K[(Al,FeIII),(FeII,Mg) ](AlSi 3,Si 4) O 10 (OH) 2, ocher (FeO), burned or natural umber Fe 2 O 3 · H 2 O + MnO 2 ·n H 2 O+ Al 2 O 3, lead white (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and yellow iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 · 4 H 2 O). It was also determined that the gold leaf usually used in byzantine icons was replaced in the case of both icons: the icon number 112 has silver leaf covered with varnish, while the halo of the icon number 113 was created with yellow <b>metallic</b> <b>pigments</b> (realgar or orpigment). The pigments were also identified by determining specific peaks in micro-FTIR spectrums. For natural ultramarine blue the peaks between 628 - 724 cm- 1 were assigned; the peaks in the interval 795 - 887 cm- 1 confirm the presence of carbonates (calcium and lead based). The earth green pigment (aluminum - silicates) had the peaks between 1464 - 1599, while the carbon black pigment was confirmed by the peaks in the interval 921 - 1060 cm- 1. After the pigments and the materials used by the author were identified, the restoration process begun with the following stages: consolidation of the painting layer (fish glue 8 % and japanese paper), stopping the xylophagous attack (encapsulation with nitrogen), consolidation of the wood supports (colophon and wax, 1 : 1), cleaning the painting layer (ethylic alcohol and distilled water, 1 : 1), filling the gaps and reintegrating the fillings in tratteggio, all followed by the process of varnishing the two icons...|$|R
50|$|The crystal’s {{magnetic}} properties, {{derived from}} its ideal shape such as anisotropy which imparted high coercivity and remanent magnetization intensities, resulted in exceptional stability and efficiency for short wavelengths, {{and it almost}} immediately appeared in high performance audio tape used in audio cassette for which treble response and hiss were always problems. Unlike the spongy looking ferric oxides used in common tape, the chromium dioxide crystals were perfectly formed and could be evenly and densely dispersed in a magnetic coating; and that led to unparalleled low noise in audio tapes. Chrome tapes did, however, require {{a new generation of}} audiocassette recorders equipped with a higher bias current capability (roughly 50% greater) than that used by iron oxide to properly magnetize the tape particles. Also introduced was a new equalization (70 µs) that traded some of the extended high-frequency response for lower noise resulting in a 5-6 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over ferric-oxide audio tapes. These bias and EQ settings were later carried over to “chrome-equivalent” cobalt-modified tapes introduced in the mid 1970s by TDK, Maxell, and others. Later research significantly increased the coercivity of the particle by doping or adsorbing rare elements such as iridium onto the crystal matrix or by improving the axial length-to-deprecated ratios.
