6000|$|... "Yes, {{he is dead}} all right," [...] he said, [...] "but all <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> {{are down}} there. My guns, six-shooters and all my ammunition. And," [...] he added ruefully, [...] "I've {{heard so much about}} the brigands that infest these mountains." ...|$|E
60|$|Removing {{the blade}} {{from my body}} I also regained my own, and turning my back upon his ugly carcass, I moved, sick, sore, and disgusted, toward the chariots which bore my retinue and <b>my</b> <b>belongings.</b> A murmur of Martian applause greeted me, but I cared not for it.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the other}} would not, {{saying that it was}} better that things should take their course. Notwithstanding that Swetman importuned him, he only added, 'If I never come again, do with <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> as you list. In the pocket you will find a gold snuff-box, and in the snuff-box fifty gold pieces.' ...|$|E
60|$|My {{room was}} ready, <b>my</b> {{personal}} <b>belongings,</b> <b>my</b> clothes {{had been laid}} out, my photographs were on the dressing-table. I took up, mechanically, the evening newspaper, but I could not read it; I thought of Maude, of the children, memories flowed in upon me,--a flood not to be dammed.... Presently the club valet knocked at my door. He had a dinner card.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hand}} into his shirt, drew out the {{handkerchief}} containing <b>my</b> precious <b>belongings,</b> passed it in to me through the bars, and went on down the gallery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I {{be of any}} {{service to}} you?" [...] I asked the girl, as I {{collected}} <b>my</b> small <b>belongings.</b> [...] "I suppose, though, that your uncle is used to the journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|Olive laughed. [...] "They will annoy {{you less}} when I am not there. If {{you will be}} so good as to ask your maid to pack up <b>my</b> <b>belongings,</b> I will send for my trunk." [...] She glanced at the coachman. [...] "Would you mind taking a little walk with me along the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what it made me realise," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{drifting}} into a dangerous position. I am linking myself to a little world to whom, personally, I am as nothing and less than nothing. I am tolerated for <b>my</b> <b>belongings!</b> If by any chance I were to lose these, what would become of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] I said, as {{he handed}} me <b>my</b> <b>belongings.</b> [...] "I wish I could have induced {{you to come in}} also. The Dead Sea is now at your elbow, and, therefore, you think nothing of it; but in ten or fifteen years' time, you would be glad {{to be able to tell}} your {{children}} that you had bathed in it." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{went into}} exile in the dog-cart to Redwood station, with Jukes the coachman, coldly silent, driving me, and all <b>my</b> {{personal}} <b>belongings</b> {{in a small}} American cloth portmanteau behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heads it is!" [...] he said coolly. [...] "Now, my boy, do you run and I'll crawl after you. If I don't arrive, {{you know}} my people's address, and I {{bequeath}} to you all <b>my</b> African <b>belongings</b> in memory of a most pleasant trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|Very soon {{this was}} done, for I brought {{out most of}} <b>my</b> few <b>belongings</b> with me and the bag of jewels was in my pocket. Then {{it was that the}} officer of the guard, a thin and melancholy-looking person, said in a hollow voice, {{addressing}} himself to Goza-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are my brother, and I am {{ashamed to}} {{acknowledge}} you. I {{was willing to}} give my last sou, to sell <b>my</b> <b>belongings,</b> to take from the poor to help you--until you defamed a good man. You cannot make me believe," [...] she cried, unheeding the color that surged into her cheeks, [...] "you cannot make me believe that he would use this money. You cannot make me believe it." ...|$|E
60|$|I lingered, with {{a sinking}} heart {{watching}} <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> come aboard and chiding my weakness of will which prevented me from uttering the few words {{that would put}} a stop to it. As for the half-dozen men who were now carrying the luggage aft into the cabin, they were unlike any concept I had ever entertained of sailors. Certainly, on the liners, I had observed nothing that resembled them.|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} that all <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> {{had been stolen}} from me, and that the robber must have taken the token too; but they didn't believe me. As proof that I was one of Hooja's people, they pointed to my weapons, which they said were ornamented {{like those of the}} is-land clan. Further, they said that no good man went in company with a jalok--and that by this line of reason-ing I certainly was a bad man.|$|E
60|$|Awakening from my dream, I {{collected}} <b>my</b> few <b>belongings,</b> bade adieu to my erring {{parents and}} departed {{out of that}} land, pausing at the grave of my grandfather, {{who had been a}} priest, to take an oath that never again, Heaven helping me, would I earn an honest penny.|$|R
60|$|However, {{just then}} {{it made me}} feel rather uncomfortable to have mother {{gathering}} up <b>my</b> few <b>belongings,</b> and telling me what to do in event of receiving such or such a wound, and, with my brain all in a whirl, I went out of doors under the pretense that it was necessary I should have a talk with Darius and Jerry.|$|R
60|$|Apparently we had,--for the moment, at any rate. I claimed <b>my</b> own <b>belongings,</b> and {{had them}} sent down to the omnibus. Then I handed my {{companion}} in {{and was on the}} point of joining her, when I saw walking along the platform, within a few feet of us, the policeman to whom I had appealed. I turned back to him.|$|R
60|$|She insisted, and I insisted; {{but at last}} we compromised. I was {{to escort}} her {{as far as the}} country of the Kro-lu and then I was to go back after my own people and lead them north into a land where the dangers were fewer and the people less murderous. She brought me all <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> that had been filched from me--rifle, ammunition, knife, and thermos bottle, and then hand in hand we descended the cliff and set off toward the north.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. George, still composedly smoking, replies, [...] "If I had, I shouldn't trouble them. I {{have been}} trouble enough to <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> in my day. It MAY {{be a very}} good sort of penitence in a vagabond, who has wasted the best time of his life, to go back then to decent people that he never was a credit to and live upon them, but it's not my sort. The best kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away, in my opinion." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} his suggestion, and slept {{more or less}} fitfully {{all the way to}} Paris. I was awakened to find that the train had come to a standstill. We were already in the station, and as I hastily collected <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> I saw that Feurgéres had left me, and was standing on the platform talking earnestly to a pale, dark young Frenchman, sombrely dressed and of insignificant appearance. I joined him just as his companion departed. He turned towards me with a peculiar smile.|$|E
3000|$|... ……….. I {{feel more}} {{committed}} when I believe that whatever I do will {{sooner or later}} be part of <b>my</b> own English <b>belongings</b> and would become mine. That’s really {{a good sense of}} command over my own language learning process.|$|R
60|$|When I got {{out into}} the dark, where my hot face cooled in the wind, my relief equaled my other feelings. Sampson had told me to clear out, and {{although}} I did not {{take that as a}} dismissal I considered I would be wise to leave the ranch at once. Daylight might disclose my footprints between the walls, but even if it did not, my work there was finished. So I went to my room and packed <b>my</b> few <b>belongings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On May 7, 2013, Désilets again left Ubisoft. When asked why, Désilets replied, [...] "Contrary to any {{statements}} made earlier today, this morning I was terminated by Ubisoft. I was notified of this termination in person, handed a termination notice and was unceremoniously escorted {{out of the}} building by two guards without being able to say goodbye to my team or collect <b>my</b> personal <b>belongings.</b> This was not my decision. Ubisoft's actions are baseless and without merit. I intend to fight Ubisoft vigorously for my rights, for my team and for my game." ...|$|R
60|$|Behold me {{then about}} six o'clock on the said Saturday evening being once more whirled by a splendid pair of horses through the gateway arch of Ragnall Castle. The {{carriage}} stopped beneath the portico, the great doors flew open revealing {{the glow of}} the hall fire and lights within, the footman sprang down from the box and two other footmen descended the steps to assist me and <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> out of the carriage. These, I remember, consisted of a handbag with my dress clothes and a yellow-backed novel.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>belongings</b> {{were packed}} snugly in a sea-chest, and I was {{all ready to}} buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil Partington arrived in Benicia. The Reindeer was needed {{immediately}} for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run straight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was {{to live with his}} family while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I should not put my chest aboard and come along.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{obstruction}} which I {{could offer}} against {{the captain of}} a ship and his crew {{would be a waste}} of energy," [...] Jocelyn observed, with fine sarcasm. [...] "At the same time, I protest most bitterly against my things being touched. Any search you deemed necessary could be undertaken at Liverpool by the Customs officers in the usual way. I consider that this entrance into my stateroom on the high seas, and this arbitrary resolve of yours to acquaint yourself with the nature of <b>my</b> <b>belongings</b> is indefensible and a gross insult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{system of}} espionage here," [...] he remarked, [...] "is painfully primitive. It lacks finesse and judgment. The fact that I have taken {{expensive}} {{rooms on the}} Campania, and that I have sent many packages there, that <b>my</b> own <b>belongings</b> are still in my rooms untouched, seems to our friends conclusive evidence that I am going to attempt to leave America by that boat. They have, I believe, a warrant for my arrest on some ridiculous charge which they intend to present at the last moment. They {{will not have the}} opportunity." ...|$|R
40|$|Somewhere in a cobwebby {{corner of}} my computer’s hard disk are a few manuscripts I wrote 15 years ago on my first PC. The word-processing {{software}} I used then was grandly named The Final Word. It was anything but. I’ve gone through a dozen word processors since then, and nearly as many computers. To keep older documents accessible, I’ve had to transfer and transform them repeatedly, from one disk to the next and from one file format to another. And still I {{have yet to find}} the Final Word. Sooner or later I’ll be gathering up <b>my</b> digital <b>belongings</b> yet again and converting them to some new format. This time I’ll have 12, 000 files in tow. I can’t wait. But my personal data-migration problems ar...|$|R
60|$|Only once in my {{recollection}} did Mrs Sheppey pay my own quarters a visit. I was kneeling on my balcony {{and out of}} sight, and could watch her unseen. She stood there--tub-shaped, a knob of dingy hair sticking out from her head, her skirts suspended round her boots--passively examining my bed, my wardrobe, and <b>my</b> other <b>belongings.</b> Her scrutiny over, she threw up her hands and the whites of her eyes as if in expostulation to heaven, turned about in her cloth boots, and waddled out again. Pollie told me, poor thing, that her children had been thorns in her side. I brooded over this. Had I not myself, however involuntarily, been a thorn in my mother's side? I despised and yet pitied Mrs Sheppey.|$|R
60|$|Thomaso {{replied that}} he {{understood}} very clearly indeed, and that, Heaven helping him, all should be kept safe and sound. Still, I was sure that in his manly heart he was promising great gifts to the saints if they would so arrange matters that Umslopogaas and his axe were never seen at Strathmuir again, and reflecting that after all the Amahagger had their uses. However, as I did not trust him in the least, much against their will, I left my driver and voorlooper to guard <b>my</b> <b>belongings.</b>|$|E
6000|$|LESBIA. I'm {{a regular}} old maid. I'm very {{particular}} about <b>my</b> <b>belongings.</b> I {{like to have}} my own house, and to have it to myself. I have a very keen sense of beauty and fitness and cleanliness and order. I am proud of my independence and jealous for it. I have a sufficiently well-stocked mind {{to be very good}} company for myself if I have plenty of books and music. The one thing I never could stand is a great lout of a man smoking all over my house and going to sleep in his chair after dinner, and untidying everything. Ugh! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, old boy, if {{that bear}} takes a fancy {{to call on}} you, it will be as well {{to be able to}} say, `Not at home,' for he could make short work of you, much though you think of yourself. Yes, this ledge is high enough to bid you defiance, mister bear, and it's long and broad enough to hold me and <b>my</b> <b>belongings.</b> The knobs by which to climb to it, too, are easy--too easy--but I'll soon rectify that. Now, then, look alive, Benjy, boy, for if that bear don't catch that seal he'll be sure to look you up." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} five years after this that I decided to live in Paris for a while. I was growing stale in London. I was tired of doing {{much the same thing}} every day. My friends pursued their course with uneventfulness; they had no longer any surprises for me, and when I met them I knew pretty well what they would say; even their love-affairs had a tedious banality. We were like tram-cars running on their lines from {{terminus}} to terminus, and it was possible to calculate within small limits the number of passengers they would carry. Life was ordered too pleasantly. I was seized with panic. I gave up my small apartment, sold <b>my</b> few <b>belongings,</b> and resolved to start afresh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{much like}} the look of things, Doctor," [...] {{he said as he}} helped me to pack <b>my</b> few <b>belongings,</b> [...] "for the fact is I can't trust that Shadrach man. His pals call him 'Cat,' a good name for him, I think. Also, he is showing his claws just now, the truth being that he hates the lot of us, and would like to get back into Purr or Mur, or {{whatever}} the name of the place is, having lost us on the road. You should have seen the way he looked at the Professor just now. Oh! I wish the Captain had let me punch his head. I'm sure it would have cleared the air a lot." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{week later}} Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her {{existence}} {{was removed from}} my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy. Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred {{what was left of}} our correspondence from among <b>my</b> scattered <b>belongings</b> and had burned it. At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was at Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and was deep in lover's talks and walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should be married at the end of June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I did, I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been, at that time, the happiest man in India.|$|R
