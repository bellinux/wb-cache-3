40|$|A {{method for}} {{predicting}} methane (74828) emissions on extended longwall faces in coal mines was developed. Methane emissions at the active faces of two coal mines were measured by sensors {{attached to the}} shields over the pass line while a continuous mining machine made three 76 meter (m) passes at the faces. One sensor was placed near the headgate and the other close to the tailgate. Air flows at the <b>methane</b> <b>monitoring</b> sites at the faces were also measured with a handheld anemometer. The <b>methane</b> <b>monitoring</b> data were analyzed by logistic regression techniques to develop an empirical equation {{that could be used}} to predict methane emissions at coal faces that were extended to 305 m. A power curve which expressed the average methane release rate as a function of each 76 m pass made by the continuous miner raised to the 0. 179889 th power fit the measured emission data best at the first coal mine. Projecting the regression curve to a fourth 76 m longwall pass predicted that methane would be released at an average rate of 0. 14 cubic meters per second (m 3 /sec). This was equivalent to a 7 % increase in methane emission for a 305 m wide coal face. A linear regression curve fit the data obtained at the second mine the best. Projecting the regression curve to a fourth 76 m pass predicted that methane would be released at an average rate of 0. 27 m 3 /sec, equivalent to a 13 % increase in methane emission for a 305 m wide face. It was noted that the relatively low predicted increase in methane emission at the face of the first mine should not result in additional methane control problems. The predicted methane emission at the face of the second mine falls within the general range where methane control problems have been experienced. Larger, 305 m wide, face widths have not been developed at the first mine. Panels with 305 m wide panels have been developed at the second mine. The measured methane emissions were less than those predicted by the empirical formula. This was attributed to an improved methane drainage program that had been implemented at the mine.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} degradation of polymeric materials was studied in batch tests by {{determination of the}} conversion yields to volatile fatty acids (acidogenesis) or to methane (methanogenesis). By both methods, filter paper, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and two starch‐containing plastic materials (low and high starch contents) were examined with glucose and polyethylene as positive and negative control, respectively. Conversion yields were {{expressed in terms of}} Theoretical Oxygen Demand (ThOD). Methanogenesis and acidogenesis are basically analogous with respect to the final conversion yield. PHB and filter paper show a high conversion yield, comparable to glucose. The material with low amount of starch additive presents very low conversion yields, whereas the starch‐based material is significantly degraded, even if in percentages not higher than starch content. Acidogenic tests are always quicker than methanogenic tests. The rate determining step is generally the hydrolysis of the particulate substrate in the case of acidogenesis and the methane formation in case of methanogenesis. Moreover, acidogenesis appears less sensitive to inhibition in the presence of sulphate.

40|$|A key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share application of chilled water sprays for prevention of frictional ignitions in coal mines to provide a safe occupational environment. Frictional ignitions in underground mines if not managed adequately may lead to major explosions. Historic statistics have indicated that the greatest explosion risk originates from frictional ignitions. Methane and dust related to explosions have resulted in over 7500 lives lost in the last ten years worldwide. The experiences of chilled water sprays used for managing heat in deep metal mines in South Africa is highly relevant to frictional incendive/face heat management in Australian coal mines. Mine ventilation and water sprays (used for dust suppression and dilution ventilation) are established technologies that are widely used in coal mines for the prevention of frictional ignitions. However, greater benefits of cooling or the sharp reduction in incendive heat from cutting picks by the use of chilled water sprays outweighs cooling using the current practice of using warm service water. Chilled water spray droplets have the potential to become „improved last line of defense‟ against gas ignitions. For example, introduction of chilled water sprays with millions of fine chilled water droplets around picks and face area would provide a simple, reliable and rapid cooling power of 210 kW and 1 005 kW for continuous miners faces and Longwall shearer face respectively. A US study has noted that 90 % of all frictional ignitions occurred in coal mines that liberated at least 0. 39 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. However, analyses of South African statistics indicate that frictional ignition have occurred in coal and gold mines that liberated even with lower emissions between 0. 02 % to 0. 05 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness that frictional ignition risks are ever present in coal mines regardless of gas contents or gas emissions.

40|$|Until {{the early}} 1980 s, mine face {{ventilation}} systems {{were designed for}} ventilating cutting depths up to 20 feet. Since that time, use of remotely operated mining machines have allowed cutting depths to increase to 40 ft, increasing concerns about the effects on methane levels at the mine face area. The principles for efficient methane control during deeper cutting remained the same, namely: 1. Move a sufficient quantity of intake air {{from the end of}} the tubing or curtain to the face. 2. Mix intake air with methane gas liberated at the face. 3. Move methane contaminated air away from the face. However, when cutting to depths greater than 20 ft (known as deep-cut mining), airflow quantities reaching the face area often decreased because it was difficult to maintain tubing or brattice setback distances. Earlier research showed that use of machine-mounted scrubbers and water sprays increased airflow at the face area during deep cutting. NIOSH research examined how these and other factors affected face airflow. A full-scale ventilation test gallery was used to study how different operating conditions caused airflow patterns and methane distributions near the face to vary. The research results showed that during deep-cut mining: 1. Without additional controls, only a small percentage of the air delivered to the end of the tubing or curtain reached the face area. 2. Operation of a machine-mounted scrubber increased airflow and reduced methane levels at the face area as long as the quantity of intake air delivered to the end of the curtain or tubing was not reduced. 3. Operation of water sprays did not significantly increase the volume of air reaching the face but did improve mixing of methane and intake air at the face. <b>Methane</b> <b>monitoring</b> requirements remained the same for deep cutting, but the possibility of rapidly changing conditions at the face increases the need for accurate estimates of face methane concentration. Research examined currently available instrumentation and sampling methods for monitoring methane at the face. The results from this NIOSH research program demonstrate how existing and new engineering controls can be used to (educe face methane levels. The sampling methods that were investigated can provide better ways to measure methane levels near the front of the continuous mining machine. In this report several practical guidelines are recommended for controlling and monitoring methane levels in the face areas of underground coal mines. Most of the recommendations were based on studies conducted in the NIOSH ventilation test gallery. 1. Free-standing fans can be used to ventilate empty headings in coal mines; a) The fan nozzle should be designed to provide maximum throw distance. b) Recirculation should be minimized by proper placement of fan inlet and or by placing curtains partway across the entry. 2. With blowing systems, the single most important factor on face methane dilution is the velocity of the air directed toward the face; a) For the same airflows, use of tubing rather than a curtain usually provides better control of face methane, especially at longer setback distances. 3. With blowing and exhausting systems, and with the mining machine at the face, use of scrubbers increases the amount of intake airflow reaching the mining face; a) Scrubber and spray systems should be designed to achieve efficient face ventilation for the effective removal of gas from the face. 4. Measurement of airflow speed and direction between the curtain and the face helps to predict methane concentrations in the face area; a) In empty entries, airflow velocity is much lower in narrower entries. More airflow should be provided during box cuts to prevent higher methane levels. 5. Regardless of intake flow quantity, increasing scrubber flow will reduce face methane levels if recirculation is controlled. Recirculation can be controlled by; a) Minimizing leakage around the ventilation curtain; b) Directing scrubber exhaust away from the blowing curtain. With exhaust systems the mouth of the curtain should always be outby the scrubber exhaust. 6. Water sprays on the mining machine should be directed to provide the best airflow across the entire face. 7. Methanometer response times can be measured using either of two techniques developed by NIOSH. Instruments with shorter response times more accurately measure current methane levels. Dust cap design has the greatest effect on response times; a) When selecting a methanometer the dust cap design should be examined. The cap should protect the methane sensor from dust and water but not significantly increase the response time. 8. Alternative methane sampling locations on the mining machine should be compared and selected based on the relative protection provided to the face workers. 9. Mine personnel should be provided with methane monitors that can be worn while working in areas that cannot be regularly monitored. Audible, visual, and vibratory alarms for the monitors should be evaluated based on the environment in which the instruments are used. 10. Miners must be safely removed from a mine without exposure to excessive methane following stoppage of a main fan; a) Mines should be evaluated for the most likely area where methane gas can accumulate following stoppage of a main mine fan. 11. In areas between the mouth of the ventilation curtain and the face, airflow direction is constantly changing and it is difficult to accurately measure flow velocity with a single-axis anemometer (e. g., a vane anemometer); a) Following approval for underground use, multi-axis anemometers should be used to monitor airflow direction and velocity between the mouth of the ventilation curtain or tubing and the face. Multi-axis instruments should also be used to monitor flow at locations outby the mining face. 12. During roof bolting, if it is not practical to monitor methane levels at the mining face, methane levels should be measured with a bolter machine-mounted monitor and a detector held 16 ft inby the last row of bolts using a extensible pole.

40|$|At {{coal mine}} working faces, {{simultaneous}} application of three basic elements reduces the methane explosion hazard: (1) adequate ventilation, (2) regular monitoring of gas concentrations, and (3) {{the elimination of}} ignition sources. This paper reviews the application of these elements in a manner relevant to Chinese coal mines. Adequate ventilation is provided by using the mine entries to convey air for the long distances between the mine portal and the working sections (main ventilation systems) and then using line brattice or ventilation duct (face ventilation systems) to convey air the last hundred meters to the working face where coal is broken and removed. The air quantity provided is enough to safely dilute methane and the air velocity is enough to prevent layering. Gas concentrations are regularly monitored in accordance with regulations using knowledge of {{the circumstances under which}} the highest concentrations are likely to be found. Ignition sources are eliminated by ensuring that electrical equipment does not ignite methane, that sparking from cutter picks is minimized, and that smoking by workers is strictly forbidden.

40|$|In This Chapter [Where methane is emitted at {{longwall}} faces Where methane accumulates at longwall faces Using {{the modified}} shearer-clearer to eliminate ventilation eddy zones Using a walkway curtain to reduce methane buildup during the headgate cutout Control of frictional ignitions and The best {{location for the}} methane monitor] The methane released along a longwall face represents only 10 %- 20 % of the total methane emitted from the entire longwall panel. Nevertheless, in very gassy coal seams, this methane released at the face can pose a problem because the shearer is a ready ignition source. Preventing methane ignitions at longwall faces requires four actions. The first is to provide better ventilation around the shearer to eliminate the ventilation eddy zones at the drums where methane builds up. These eddy zones are eliminated by mounting additional water sprays on the shearer to direct air into them. The second action to prevent methane ignitions is to install a water spray behind each cutter bit and regularly replace worn bits. Water sprays behind each cutter bit act to quench the hot metal streak that follows a worn bit when it strikes rock. The third {{is to ensure that}} no ventilation eddy zones are inadvertently created by poor placement of water sprays. The fourth is to ensure that the <b>methane</b> <b>monitor</b> on the shearer is in the best location to detect methane accumulations. ADDRESSING METHANE ACCUMULATIONS AT LONGWALL FACES 3 Cecala et al. [1985 a, 1989] and Denk and Wirth [1991] studied methane emission and ventilation patterns at longwall faces to find where methane accumulations are most likely. Although not always the case, the major source of methane at longwall faces is usually the breakage of coal by the shearer. Stress-related fracturing of the coal seam at the face, called bumps or bounces, can cause the release of additional gas (Figure 4 - 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{characteristics}} in a lean coal reservoir in the Gucheng block, southern Qinshui Basin, {{are discussed in}} this study. Relational models among the stress, burial depth and permeability in coal reservoir No. 3 in the Shanxi Formation were built, and the relationships among the coal fractures, coal permeabilities and distribution of the modern stress were analyzed. In the Gucheng block of the southern Qinshui Basin, the distribution of modern stress and its control on coal fractures and coal permeability have been determined using geological and statistical methods applied to subsurface observations of coal rocks, log interpretations of 50 coalbed methane wells, in situ stress data from 8 coalbed <b>methane</b> wells, <b>monitoring</b> data on fractures and seismic results from 14 coalbed methane wells.

Hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers (HC-PBF) have emerged as a promising technology {{in the field of}} gas sensing. The long interaction pathlengths achievable with these fibers are especially advantageous for the detection of weakly absorbing regions of methane. In this paper, a novel methane sensor based on HC-PBF capable of measuring CH 4 concentrations down to 0. 1 % in air has been demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Due to its environmental, {{economical}} {{and safety}} implications, methane leak detection {{is a crucial}} task to address in the biogas production industry. In this paper, we introduce Gasbot, a robotic platform that aims to automatize <b>methane</b> emission <b>monitoring</b> in landfills and biogas production sites. The distinctive characteristic of the Gasbot platform {{is the use of}} a Tunable Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor. This sensor provides integral concentration measurements over the path of the laser beam. Existing gas distribution mapping algorithms can only handle local measurements obtained from traditional in-situ chemical sensors. In this paper we also describe an algorithm to generate 3 D methane concentration maps from integral concentration and depth measurements. The Gasbot platform has been tested in two different scenarios: an underground corridor, where a pipeline leak was simulated and in a decommissioned landfill site, where an artificial methane emission source was introduced. I...|$|R

TROPOMI will <b>monitor</b> <b>methane</b> and carbon monoxide concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere by measuring spectra of back-scattered sunlight in the short-wave infrared (SWIR). S 5 P will be the first satellite mission to rely uniquely on the spectral window at 4190 - 4340 cm- 1 (2. 3 μm) to retrieve CH 4 and CO. In this study, we investigated if the absorption features of the three relevant molecules CH 4, CO, and...|$|R
