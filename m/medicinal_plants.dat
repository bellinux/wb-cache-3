5|$|Many <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> produce {{chemical}} compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> that contain them.|$|E

40|$|A survey {{research}} was conducted on some <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> species envisaged of having the potential for preservation of herbal preparations. The aim {{was to determine whether}} there is an interspecific relationship among some selected <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> species using their total extracts as the basis for computerization. To this end, statistical model comprising the Duncan’s Multiple Range Test and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to the total extract obtained from the <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> species harvested from Mampong- and Mamfe-Akuapem environs to determine the existence of variations. The results showed the existence of variation and some of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> species were more influential or weighted more than others...|$|R

5|$|<b>Medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> {{are widely}} used in non-industrialized societies, not least because they are far cheaper than modern medicines. The annual global export value of {{pharmaceutical}} plants in 2012 was over US$2.2 billion. In many countries there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization is coordinating a network to encourage safe and rational usage. <b>Medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> face both general threats such as climate change and habitat loss, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.|$|E

5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants,</b> starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants.</b> Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants,</b> as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E

5|$|Where <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> are {{harvested}} {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants,</b> or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E

5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants,</b> and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants.</b> The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
5|$|Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof {{argue that}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> provide three main kinds of benefit: health {{benefits}} {{to the people who}} consume them as medicines; financial benefits to people who harvest, process, and distribute them for sale; and society-wide benefits such as job opportunities, taxation income, and a healthier labour force.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
