5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E

During the 1930s there were a number of projects undertaken on Darby Creek by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dikes along the southern end of the creek were repaired by a joint force of the Works Progress Administration, the Pennsylvania legislature, and Delaware County. A series of ditches in the Tinicum marshland were constructed by the Corps in 1935 as a means of <b>mosquito</b> <b>control.</b> The dredged material was deposited throughout the marsh over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, <b>mosquito</b> <b>control,</b> and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with <b>mosquito</b> <b>control</b> measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Manipulation of the {{mosquito}} gut microbiota can lay {{the foundations for}} novel methods for disease transmission <b>control.</b> <b>Mosquito</b> blood feeding triggers a significant, transient increase of the gut microbiota, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms by which the <b>mosquito</b> <b>controls</b> this bacterial growth whilst limiting inflammation of the gut epithelium. Here, we investigate the gut epithelial response to the changing microbiota load upon blood feeding in the malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii. We show that the synthesis and integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which physically separates the gut epithelium from its luminal contents, is microbiota dependent. We reveal that the peritrophic matrix limits the growth and persistence of Enterobacteriaceae within the gut, whilst preventing seeding of a systemic infection. Our results demonstrate that the peritrophic matrix is a key regulator of mosquito gut homeostasis and establish functional analogies between this and the mucus layers of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree field {{populations of}} Cx. pipiens (L.) {{mosquitoes}} {{were collected from}} three different localities in Riyadh city. They were tested for developing resistance against commonly used insecticides to <b>control</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> in Riyadh. Two populations from Wadi Namar (WN 1 and WN 2) were highly resistant to deltamethrin (187. 1 - and 161. 4 -folds respectively). The field population from AL-Wadi district (AL-W) showed low resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin (3. 8 -folds) and moderate resistance to beta-cyfluthrin and bifenthrin (14 - and 38. 4 -folds respectively). No resistance to fenitrothion was observed in WN 1 population. Fenitrothion concentrations required to inhibit 50 % of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in both WN 1 population and the laboratory susceptible strain (S-LAB) were 0. 073 and 0. 078 ppm respectively. Piperonyl butoxide suppressed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides (> 90 %) in field populations indicating that oxidases and/or esterases {{play an important role}} in the reduction of pyrethroids toxicity.

40|$|More {{focus is}} given to <b>mosquito</b> larval <b>control</b> due to the {{necessity}} to use several control techniques together in integrated vector management programmes. Botanical products {{are thought to be}} able to provide effective, sustainable and cheap <b>mosquito</b> larval <b>control</b> tools. However, bio-larvicides like Azadirachta indica (neem) could repel adult mosquitoes from laying their eggs in the treated larval habitats. In this study the response of Anopheles gambiae s. s. mosquitoes towards varying doses of crude aqueous neem extracts was examined. Non-choice oviposition tests were used to measure the proportion of mosquitoes laying on the first or second night, or not laying at all, when compared to the control. For each individual mosquito, the number of eggs laid and/or retained in the ovary was counted to determine the relationship between wing length and egg production. Larger female mosquitoes produced larger egg batches. The results show that at a dose of 0. 1 g/l, a concentration previously found to be effective at <b>controlling</b> <b>mosquito</b> larvae, the oviposition behaviour of adult female mosquitoes was not significantly affected. The results indicate that the mosquitoes would expose progeny to this neem control tool, making the use of these simple neem wood extracts effective and potentially sustainable...|$|R

25|$|The Palo Alto Flood Basin was {{constructed}} in 1956 {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator-controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for <b>mosquito</b> <b>control.</b> Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however this is precisely when steelhead trout in-migrations should occur. In 2002 a small opening was cut in the trash grate on the tidal gate to permit fish passage but local fisherman in the Flood Basin no longer report catching steelhead trout in recent years.|$|E
500|$|Other {{insecticides}} {{are available}} for <b>mosquito</b> <b>control,</b> {{as well as physical}} measures, such as draining the wetland breeding grounds and the provision of better sanitation. Pyrethrum (from the flowering plant Chrysanthemum [...] cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting. The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 BCE. Pyrethrins are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.|$|E
