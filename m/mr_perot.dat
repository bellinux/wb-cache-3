Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas met in Texas to sign NAFTA, {{which would}} create a trilateral trade bloc and {{financial}} zone in North America. To take effect, NAFTA had to be ratified by the legislatures in the three countries. Long before the signing ceremony, Donahue was already leading a massive campaign by the AFL-CIO against US ratification. As early as February, 1991, “the AFL-CIO has made blocking a Mexican agreement its No. 1 legislative priority,” the New York Times reported. The main reasons for AFL-CIO opposition were that “it would {{pave the way for}} tens of thousands of… jobs to be exported to Mexico, and it would bump hundreds of thousands down the economic ladder to underemployment and low wages,” Donahue wrote. He condemned its “powerfully regressive effect” and noted, “The jobs that are most easily exported to Mexico are not those of probate attorneys, stockbrokers, economists, and editorial writers; they are the jobs of assembly-line workers and others who can least afford a massive disruption of their work lives.” [...] The AFL-CIO was certainly not the only opponent of NAFTA. Others included Ross Perot (among the most vocal critics of NAFTA), the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the National Farmers Union, the National Council of Senior Citizens, Ralph Nader’s Public Citizen, Jerry Brown’s We the People, and Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition. However, a pro-NAFTA editorial in the Washington Post complained that “it’s not Ross Perot but the labor movement that’s the central force in the campaign to kill NAFTA - the North American Free Trade Agreement. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Perot</b> has little following in Congress, but the unions have been working ferociously to line up their friends and campaign beneficiaries against the agreement.” [...] Donahue succeeded in mobilizing the entire trade union movement against NAFTA. The New York Times reported that “within the labor movement, the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions…’Our self-interest is very similar,’ said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. When factories close, he said, community tax revenues plunge, so teachers lose wages and jobs.” [...] Beyond the AFL-CIO, Donahue oversaw what the New York Times described as the federation’s “lobbying, petition drives and $3.2 million in billboard and radio advertising.” [...] He testified before Congress against NAFTA at least nine times. He appeared on such TV shows as NBC’s Meet the Press [...] and CNN’s Late Edition. He frequently wrote articles, letters to editors, and op-ed pieces for leading newspapers. And he built an unprecedented working coalition between the AFL-CIO and leading environmentalists, notably the Sierra Club and the National Toxics Campaign - the strongest relationship {{in the history of the}} two movements. All of it was not enough. By September, 1993, NAFTA’s supporters “seem to have the stronger hand: the prestige of the White House as well as five of its former occupants; a slew of eminent economists; the nation’s most powerful business lobbies, including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers; and even the Christian Coalition. The Mexican government, as well, has poured millions of dollars into U.S. lobbying,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Two months later, NAFTA passed the House by a vote of 234-200 and the Senate by a vote of 61-38. It was signed by President Clinton on December 8, 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Nine years later, an Economic Policy Institute briefing paper on NAFTA’s effects pointed out that “the rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico through 2002 has caused the displacement of production that supported 879,280 U.S. jobs. Most of those lost jobs were high-wage positions in manufacturing industries.” It continued, “The loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy. In fact, NAFTA has also contributed to rising income inequality, suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened workers' collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions, and reduced fringe benefits.” ...|$|E
