40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} decade, Kriging-based {{sequential}} algorithms like EGO [2] and its variants have become reference optimization methods in computer experiments. Such algorithms {{rely on the}} iterative maximization of a sampling criterion, the expected improvement (EI), which takes advantage of Kriging conditional distributions to make an explicit trade-off between promizing and uncertain search space points. We have recently worked on a <b>multipoints</b> EI criterion meant to simultaneously choose several points, which is useful for instance in synchronous parallel computation. The research results that we wish to present in this paper concern sequential procedures with a fixed number of iterations. We show that maximizing the 1 -point criterion at each iteration (EI algorithm) is suboptimal. In essence, the latter amounts to considering the current iteration as the last one. This work formulates the problem of optimal strategy for finite horizon sequential optimization, provides {{the solution to this}} problem in terms of <b>multipoints</b> EI, and illustrates the suboptimality of the usual EI algorithm {{on the basis of a}} first counter-example. ...|$|R

5000|$|Philippe Gaucher {{proposed}} an alternative formalisation {{of the notion}} of directed space which is, roughly speaking, based on the category of directed graphs enriched in topological spaces i.e. the collection of arrows from x to y is endowed with a topology. This approach gives rise to the so-called category of Flows, which admits a nontrivial model category structure. He introduced a topological version (here a topological category means a category equipped with a topological forgetful functor towards the category of sets) using a variant of Marco Grandis' d-spaces, the <b>multipointed</b> d-spaces. In recent papers, he constructed similar model category structures on cubical higher-dimensional transition systems (whose a reflective subcategory is the one of Cattani-Sassone higher-dimensional transition systems) [...] and on labelled symmetric precubical sets. The common points of all these model category structures is 1) the presence of the cofibration {0,1}→{0} identifying two states, 2) the non-contractibility of the directed segment, 3) the strong relationship with the computer-scientific notion of bisimulation. The cylinders of the category of flows and of the category of <b>multipointed</b> d-spaces make the globes oscillate by keeping the set of states constant. All objects of the model categories of flows and <b>multipointed</b> d-spaces are fibrant. It can be checked that the cylinders of these model categories satisfy the homotopy exchange property introduced by Lafont-Métayer-Worytkiewicz in their work about globular omega-categories. The cylinders of the category of cubical transition systems and of labelled symmetric precubical sets make the cubes oscillate by keeping the set of states constant as well. These latter model category structures are constructed using M. Olschok's PhD which generalizes Cisinski's work on the homotopy theory of toposes. In these latter model category structures, all objects are cofibrant.|$|R

The {{study of the}} branching and merging homologies of a time flow requires a very specific feature: the mapping taking an object to its set of non-constant execution paths must be functorial. The first model I studied is the one of non-contracting Kan strict globular omega-categories consisting of the category of strict globular omega-categories C such that PC=C_ 1 U C_ 2 U [...] . is a strict omega-groupoid (hence the word ''Kan'', C_n being the set of n-morphisms) and of omega-functors f:C -> D inducing a map of strict omega-groupoids Pf:PC->PD (hence the word ''non-contracting''). The second model I studied is {{a version of the}} preceding model in which the path space PC is topologized, hence the notion of flows (small category without identities enriched over topological spaces). The third and last model I am studying now is a variant of M. Grandis' notion of d-space, the <b>multipointed</b> d-spaces, in which not only the path space is topologized, but also the direction of time. The three models are locally presentable, by working with Delta-generated spaces. The last one of <b>multipointed</b> d-spaces is also topological.
