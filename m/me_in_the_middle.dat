500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. An examination {{of some of the}} lyrics from bands such as these show a lack of any explicitly negative themes. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] could just as well be a conversation between husband and wife, as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; Meet <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please meet me with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} April 2009, Berlusconi's wife Veronica Lario, {{who would}} divorce him several years later, wrote an open letter expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, {{attractive}} female candidates—some {{with little or no}} political experience—to represent the party in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had [...] "done this to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an election campaign", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing. [...] On 3 May, Lario announced she was filing for divorce.

2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.) Harlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his [...] "CIA source" [...] for his column [...] "Mission to Niger".|$|E
