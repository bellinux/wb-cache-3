In July 2008, Iraq had formally requested an order for 24 light attack and reconnaissance helicopters. The aircraft would either be the U.S. Army's new ARH-70 helicopter or the MH-6 Little Bird.|$|E

25|$|To {{the back}} of the church stood the Oldham Corporation Tram Depot. In 1907 the church bought from the Corporation a strip of land between the two {{buildings}} measuring 196 square yards at a cost of £61.5.0. In 1910 the congregation considered whether it <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> the Depot as well but nothing came of this. In 1912 the church committee wrote to the Tramways Manager complaining that the grinding of trams often disturbed worship. The Manager was asked to instruct drivers to go very slowly past the church and to stop ringing the bell at the terminus during service time.|$|E
25|$|Lüneburg {{had been}} {{captured}} by the British forces on 18 April 1945 with Montgomery establishing his headquarters at a villa {{in the village of}} Häcklingen. A German delegation arrived at his tactical headquarters on the Timeloberg hill by car on 3 May, having been sent by Großadmiral Karl Dönitz who had been nominated President and Supreme Commander of the German armed forces by Adolf Hitler in his last will and testament on 29 April. Dönitz was aware of the allied occupation zones intended for Germany from a plan that had fallen into German hands. He therefore hoped that protracted partial and local surrender negotiations <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> time for troops and refugees in the east to seek refuge from the Red Army, whilst holding open a pocket to provide sanctuary on {{the west bank of the}} River Elbe.|$|E

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} exist of how Lennon met Ono. According to the first, {{told by the}} Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono {{was preparing}} her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's [...] "Hammer A Nail": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, [...] "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> it." [...] Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five , to which Lennon replied, [...] "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in." [...] The second version, told by McCartney, is that in late 1965, Ono was in London compiling original musical scores for a book John Cage was working on, Notations, but McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts for the book, suggesting that Lennon might oblige. When asked, Lennon gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to [...] "The Word".|$|E
500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Behold This Dreamer was {{followed}} by the publication of Poetry Concerto, also in 1961. Meanwhile, Bartlett had published more than 200 poems in literary reviews and anthologies, and felt encouraged to bring out a collection of her poetry. She sent the manuscript of the new work to Moore, who wrote: [...] "You have here what is indeed a conspectus of experience, and I thank you for the book. It seems an anomaly that it is not in 'hard covers,' in shops where all <b>might</b> <b>buy.</b> This must be corrected.

2500|$|Early {{the next}} year, on 16 January 1809, Franchise {{captured}} the French {{letter of marque}} Iphigenie after a chase of 30 hours. She was pierced for 18 guns but only carrying six, all of which, together with her anchors, she had thrown overboard during the chase. She and her crew of 26 were sailing from Bayonne, {{where she had been}} launched two months earlier, to Guadeloupe with a cargo of naval stores and provisions, with the intent of taking up privateering once in the West Indies. Dashwood, {{in the hope that the}} navy <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> her, described Iphigenie as [...] "... coppered, and sails remarkably fast, having been pursued several Times during her Passage".|$|E

2500|$|Buyers {{often use}} the diplomas to claim {{academic}} credentials {{for use in}} securing employment. For example, a schoolteacher <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to superintendent. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months {{from the time of}} enrollment, and back-dating is possible. Academic credit may be offered for [...] "life experience," [...] a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution. This {{should not be confused with}} legitimate programs offering recognition of prior learning, which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{campaign}} and upon dropping of the writs, opinion polling indicated the Liberals were ahead of the Conservatives by 2–10% popular support (November 30, 2005: Liberals 35%, Conservatives 30%). However, the Liberal lead did not last. [...] They did not plan much serious campaigning during December, allowed the Conservatives {{to take the initiative}} in rolling out policy ideas. [...] Several early gaffes were picked up by an unsympathetic media. One notable gaffe was Liberal Party strategist Scott Reid's suggestion that parents <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> beer and popcorn with the Conservative's child care subsidy, although Martin declined to apologize. Martin was also criticized for portraying himself as the defender of Canadian unity; some opponents pointed that this election was not a referendum while others pointed to the Sponsorship Scandal.|$|E
2500|$|As Minister of State and Defence in 2004, Portas was {{responsible}} for the decision to buy two submarines for the Portuguese Navy after reducing from three (with an option to buy a fourth) the original number of submarines that the previous government had indicated Portugal <b>might</b> <b>buy</b> from Germany's Ferrostaal industrial group. Paulo Portas also personally authorized that the agreed equipment for the two submarines be downgraded (without any reduction in price) by 30 million euros, which, coincidentally or not, was the same amount as paid to ESCOM (see above). [...] The purchase was conducted through a sales intermediary named German Submarine Consortium (GSC) and the price of the submarines was between 712 million to 1.2 billion euros depending on calculations. The bill came due in 2010 and was {{a major factor in the}} budgetary crisis that erupted that year and led to political finger-pointing in what came to be known as [...] "the submarines affair" [...] (in Portuguese: [...] "caso dos submarinos"). The deal also had an obscure [...] "counterparts" [...] provision for the German side to purchase Portuguese goods and provide equipment, that may have been overvalued by hundreds of millions of euros (again depending on calculations) giving plenty of margin for embezzlement schemes. Moreover, the deal was shown in Germany to involve corruption and two German executives were prosecuted and convicted in 2011 of bribery, including of the Portuguese consul in Munich, who said during the trial he had met with Paulo Portas in the context of the submarines' negotiations. A similar submarines deal in Greece was also shown to involve corruption and resulted in 2010 in the exoneration of the chief executive of Ferrostaal and in 2012 in the arrest of Paulo Portas's Greek Defence Minister counterpart Akis Tsochatzopoulos. In Portugal, a Navy commander and a former PSD leader (who was one of Portas's favourite targets when he was director of the newspaper [...] "O Independente") have been implicated of receiving at least 1 million euros.|$|E
