5|$|The Engineers, {{also known}} as space jockeys, are an ancient race of large humanoids which created {{humanity}} from their own DNA during Earth's primordial era. In Alien, the fossilized corpse of an Engineer is discovered in the pilot's seat of the derelict alien spacecraft; its suit and helmet {{were thought to be}} bones, and is the first victim of the Aliens identified onscreen. The Engineers {{play a central role in}} the first prequel, Prometheus, which reveals their biology and intention to infect the human race with an alien contagion and <b>mutagen.</b> In the film, the last surviving Engineer on LV-223 is awakened and immediately tries to resume his mission of delivering the substance to Earth, but he is subsequently stopped by the survivors of the human expedition. The android David 8 pilots an Engineer ship to the species' home world, where he unleashes the <b>mutagen</b> against the population, which kills all the Engineers and all other non-floral life on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black <b>mutagen,</b> tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from the lander, Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne <b>mutagen</b> to enter his ear canal. His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to the lander by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine in the room, where the first Neomorph bursts out of his spine, killing him.|$|E
50|$|Different <b>mutagens</b> {{act on the}} DNA differently. Powerful <b>mutagens</b> {{may result}} in {{chromosomal}} instability, causing chromosomal breakages and rearrangement of the chromosomes such as translocation, deletion, and inversion. Such <b>mutagens</b> are called clastogens.|$|R
40|$|Antimutagenic {{activities}} of live and killed cells of 6 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 9 strains of bifidobacteria and of organic acids usually produced by these probiotic bacteria were determined using 8 potent chemical <b>mutagens</b> and promutagens. The <b>mutagens</b> and promutagens used were N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine; 2 -nitroflourene; 4 -nitro-O- phenylenediamine; 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide; Aflatoxin-B; 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 3 H-imidazoquinoline; 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenyl-imidazo (4, 5 -b) pyridine, and 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 9 H-pyrido (3, 3 - 6) indole. The mutagenicity of these <b>mutagens</b> and antimutagenic activity of probiotic bacteria against the <b>mutagens</b> were determined {{according to the}} Ames TA- 100 assay using a mutant Salmonella typhimurium. Efficiency of bacterial cells in binding or inhibiting these <b>mutagens</b> was also investigated. Live cells of probiotic bacteria showed higher antimutagenic activity and their efficiency in inhibiting the <b>mutagens</b> was better than killed bacterial cells. Live bacterial cells bound or inhibited the <b>mutagens</b> permanently, whereas killed bacteria released <b>mutagens</b> upon extraction with dimethyl sulfoxide. Among the organic acids, butyric acid showed highest inhibition of <b>mutagens</b> followed by acetic acid. Lactic and pyruvic acids did not show appreciable levels of inhibition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Germ cell <b>mutagens</b> are {{currently}} classified {{into three categories}} in the German List of MAK- and BAT-Values. These categories have been revised and extended in analogy to the new categories for carcinogenic chemicals. Germ cell <b>mutagens</b> produce heritable gene mutations, and heritable structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in germ cells. The original categories 1 and 2 for germ cell <b>mutagens</b> remained unchanged. Two new categories 3 A and 3 B are proposed for chemicals which are suspected to be germ cell <b>mutagens.</b> A new category 5 is proposed for germ cell <b>mutagens</b> with low potency which contribute negligibly to human genetic risk provided the MAK value is observed. The following categories are presented for further discussion. 1. Germ cell <b>mutagens</b> which {{have been shown to}} increase the mutant frequency among the progeny of exposed humans. 2. Germ cell <b>mutagens</b> which have been shown to increase the mutant frequency among the progeny of exposed animals. 3 A. Substances which have been shown to induce genetic damage in germ cells of humans or animals, or which are mutagenic in somatic cells and have been shown to reach the germ cells in their active forms. 3 B. Substances which are suspected of being germ cell <b>mutagens</b> because of their genotoxic effects in mammalian somatic cells in vivo or, in exceptional cases in the absence of in vivo data, if they are clearly mutagenic in vitro and structurally related to in vivo <b>mutagens.</b> 4. not applicable (Category 4 was introduced for carcinogenic substances with nongenotoxic modes of action. By definition, germ cell <b>mutagens</b> are genotoxic. Therefore, a Category 4 for germ cell <b>mutagens</b> cannot exist.) 5. Germ cell <b>mutagens,</b> the potency of which is considered to be so low that, provided the MAK value is observed, their contribution to genetic risk is expected not to be significant...|$|R
5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition {{to the source of}} Shaw's signal. At the entrance of the crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne <b>mutagen</b> to be inhaled through his nose. By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make their way back to the lander, Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching the lander, which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Static Shock is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} {{based on the}} Milestone Media/DC Comics superhero Static. It premiered on September 23, 2000, on The WB Television Network's Kids' WB! block programming. Static Shock ran for four seasons, with 52 half-hour episodes in total. The show revolves around Virgil Hawkins, an American boy of African descent, who uses the secret identity of Static after exposure to a <b>mutagen</b> gas during a gang fight gave him electromagnetic powers. Part of the DC animated universe, the series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation from a crew composed mostly {{of people from the}} company's past shows but also with the involvement of two of the comic's creators, Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of <b>mutagen.</b> For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
40|$|From a {{chemical}} point of view, the following subjects are important areas in studies on <b>mutagens</b> and carcinogens in broiled foods. In addition to heterocyclic amines which need microsomal activation, the structural elucidation of more labile direct-acting <b>mutagens</b> is necessary. It {{is known that}} there are still various unknown minor <b>mutagens</b> in broiled foods. Although the structural characterization of such compounds is more difficult, it is important since they might be hazardous in spite of their low mutagenicity. A more feasible and easier method for quantitative analysis of <b>mutagens,</b> in addition to HPLC and GC/MS methods presently employed, must be developed. The mechanism of formation of <b>mutagens</b> by broiling of food should be studied. An effective chemical method to prevent formation of <b>mutagens</b> or to destroy them, once formed, should be developed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{carcinogenic}} metabolites of the carcinogen 2 -acetyl-aminofluorene, especially 2 -nitrosofluorene and N-hydroxy- 2 -aminofluorene, are potent frameshift <b>mutagens</b> for Salmonella typhimurium. 2 -Nitrosonaphthalene, 2 -nitrosophenanthrene, 4 -nitroso-trans-stilbene, 4 -nitrosobiphenyl, and 4 -nitrosoazobenzene, all {{of which}} are metabolites or likely metabolites of carcinogenic aromatic amines, are also potent frameshift <b>mutagens.</b> These compounds may be frameshift <b>mutagens</b> of the class that intercalates into DNA and then reacts covalently with the DNA; various ultimate carcinogens may be of this type. The utility of a set of bacterial strains for detecting carcinogens as <b>mutagens</b> is shown...|$|R
25|$|Point {{mutations}} {{may arise}} from spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication. The rate of mutation may be increased by <b>mutagens.</b> <b>Mutagens</b> can be physical, such as radiation from UV rays, X-rays or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). <b>Mutagens</b> associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.|$|R
5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and the dreams of the crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken the Engineer. He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and the Engineer decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her {{that he would like to}} help her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises to take her to the Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the <b>mutagen</b> on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the <b>mutagen</b> to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at the Engineer temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the human embryos and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the <b>mutagen,</b> resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{breakthrough}} publications, {{and support}} from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a <b>mutagen.</b> Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E
40|$|For use in {{screening}} for environmental <b>mutagens</b> and carcinogens, a highly fluorescent derivative of guanosine, 2 '-deoxy- 2 '-(2 ", 3 "-dihydro- 2 ", 4 "-diphenyl- 2 "-hydroxy- 3 "-oxo-l"-pyrrolyl) guanosine (FG), was synthesized. When incubated with FG in aqueous solution, <b>mutagens</b> form adducts {{that can be}} analyzed with an HPLC-fluorescence detector-system. By this method, <b>mutagens</b> such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 2 -(2 -furyl) - 3 -(5 -nitrofuryl) acryl-amide and 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide, used as model compounds, were detected rapidly with high sensitivity. Reaction with isopropylideneguanosine (IPG), followed by isolation and characterization of the mutagen-IPG-adduct {{was found to be}} a useful method for identifying unknown <b>mutagens</b> in crude samples. This method was success-fully applied in identification of the <b>mutagens</b> in heated glucose (200 °C, 20 min); glyoxal-IPG and 8 -hydroxy-IPG were identified in the reaction mixture...|$|R
5000|$|Chemical <b>mutagens</b> {{were not}} {{demonstrated}} to cause mutation until the 1940s, when Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson found that mustard gas can cause mutations in fruit flies.

There she learns of Phazon, a mysterious <b>mutagen</b> that can alter the genetic material of any organism. Samus is eventually able to access {{the source of the}} planet's Phazon contamination, a meteor impact crater, where she defeats the Phazon-infused creature Metroid Prime. In Metroid Prime Hunters, Samus competes against six rival bounty hunters in a race to recover an alien ultimate weapon. In , Samus is sent to the planet Aether, a Phazon meteor-ravaged planet split into light and dark dimensions. There she battles the Ing, creatures that are able to possess other organisms, and Dark Samus, an evil doppelgänger of herself formed from the remains of her Phazon Suit and Metroid Prime itself. In , Dark Samus infects Samus with Phazon, which slowly corrupts her and further forces her to prevent it from spreading to other planets. By the end of the game, she renders all Phazon inert by destroying its original source, the planet Phaaze, and permanently destroys Dark Samus. In , Samus is tasked by the Galactic Federation to investigate the Space Pirates' presence in the Bermuda System and provide intelligence to the Federation Force. However, after the Force abruptly loses contact with her, they later discover that she had been captured by the Pirates and is brainwashed into fighting them while in her Morph Ball form. After the Federation Force reluctantly defeat her, they proceed to help their fleet destroy the Pirates' massive battleship before narrowly escaping death {{with the help of a}} recovered Samus.|$|E
