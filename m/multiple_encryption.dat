30|$|To gain a {{resistance}} against KPA and CPA, a CS-based cryptosystem normally operates in an OTS manner, by renewing the sensing matrix at each encryption. As the renewal requires the additional complexity and can quickly waste up the cryptographic resource for generating each sensing matrix, a CS-based cryptosystem reusing the sensing matrix during <b>multiple</b> <b>encryptions</b> {{has also been}} of interest. However, it is insecure against KPA and CPA, since an adversary can easily recover the sensing matrix with N linearly independent plaintexts by solving the system of linear equations [15]. While reusing the same sensing matrix, the BLP-CS [30] attempted to overcome the weakness and to achieve a CPA-resistance by ensuring a RIPless reconstruction for an adversary.|$|R

40|$|Most cryptosystems {{are defined}} over finite {{algebraic}} structures where arithmetic operations are performed modulo natural numbers. This applies to private key {{as well as}} to public key ciphers. No secure cryptosystems defined over the field of real numbers are known. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of constructing secure symmetric key ciphers defined over the field of real numbers. We consider the security of ciphers introduced in a previous work and based on solving linear and non-linear equations numerically. We complement the design of those ciphers to satisfy the requirements of secure systems and, consequently, extend them into composite ciphers with <b>multiple</b> <b>encryptions.</b> We show security enhancements by estimating the uncertainty in finding the keys using a measure based on Shannon's entropy function.

50|$|The meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is {{a generic}} space-time {{tradeoff}} cryptographic attack against encryption schemes which rely on performing <b>multiple</b> <b>encryption</b> operations in sequence.

40|$|Traditional {{cryptography}} system {{shares the}} keys between senders and receivers for encryption and decryption {{purpose to achieve}} the data security, where these key sharing was done through the certificate exchange and signature storage. But it did not scale well as number of users get increased key distribution and signature storage was the great challenge. To overcome this problem of traditional cryptography system Identity Based Encryption has been proposed, where instead of IDs itself were used for encryption, which again leads to the limitation of only one-to-one communication was possible. To solve this problem multicast communication can be made possible through the Attribute Based Encryption. Single mediator and key policy ABE was used, which was not so efficient and failed for providing revocation. So MAMM concept with CP-ABE was proposed which gives more security by <b>multiple</b> <b>encryptions</b> through hierarchical mediators.

This format can contain H.264 video compression and MP3 or AAC audio compression. In addition, F4V file format can contain data corresponding to the ActionScript Message Format and still frame of video data using image formats GIF, JPEG and PNG.Microsoft Corporation announced in 2009 a file format based on the ISO base media file format — ISMV (Smooth Streaming format), also known as Protected Interoperable File Format (PIFF). As announced, this format can for example contain VC-1, WMA, H.264 and AAC compression formats. Microsoft published a Protected Interoperable File Format (PIFF) specification in 2010. It defined another usage of <b>multiple</b> <b>encryption</b> and DRM systems in a single file container. PIFF brand was registered by the MP4 registration authority in 2010.
