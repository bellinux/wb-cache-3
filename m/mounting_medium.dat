50|$|The <b>mounting</b> <b>medium</b> is the {{solution}} in which the specimen is embedded, generally under a cover glass. Simple liquids like water or glycerol can be considered mounting media, though the term generally refers to compounds that harden into a permanent mount. Popular mounting media include Permount, glycerol jelly, and Hoyer's <b>mounting</b> <b>medium.</b> Properties of a good <b>mounting</b> <b>medium</b> include having a refractive index close to that of glass (1.518), non-reactivity with the specimen, stability over time without crystallizing, darkening, or changing refractive index, solubility in the medium the specimen was prepared in (either aqueous or non-polar, such as xylene or toluene), and not causing the specimen stain to fade or leach.|$|E

5000|$|Removable {{media have}} become very common with {{microcomputer}} platforms. They allow programs and data to be transferred between machines without a physical connection. Common examples include USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.

50|$|A {{relatively}} recent use (as of 2006) of thiodiglycol is as a <b>mounting</b> <b>medium</b> in microscopy.

50|$|For {{pathological}} {{and biological}} research, the specimen usually undergoes a complex histological preparation that involves fixing it to prevent decay, removing any water contained in it, replacing {{the water with}} paraffin, cutting it into very thin sections using a microtome, placing the sections on a microscope slide, staining the tissue using various stains to reveal specific tissue components, clearing the tissue to render it transparent and covering it with a coverslip and <b>mounting</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Karlite {{possesses}} moderate optical relief, {{the degree}} to which the mineral grains stand out from the <b>mounting</b> <b>medium.</b> This mineral is orthorhombic and sphenoidal, exhibiting symmetry on 222. Karlite is also enantiomorphic and dihedral. It is a member of the P212121 space group. This mineral forms optically negative biaxial birefringent crystals, meaning that the 2V angle between the optic axes is bisected by the refractive index direction. Because this mineral possesses birefringence, we know it is anisotropic and will display double refraction; it breaks light into two different rays traveling at different speeds in the mineral.|$|E
50|$|QEMSCAN is {{routinely}} {{employed in the}} analysis of rock- and ore-forming minerals. Sample preparation requirements include a level, dry specimen surface, coated with a thin electrically conductive layer (e.g. carbon). The sample must be stable under high vacuum conditions and the electron beam, typically 15 to 25 kV. Common sample types include 30 mm resin-impregnated blocks of drill cuttings and ore, thin sections of drill core and rocks, as well as soil samples. Very small particles such as atmospheric dust have been measured on carbon tape or filter paper. Coal samples are generally mounted in carnauba wax, providing sufficient contrast to allow for separation of the sample from the <b>mounting</b> <b>medium,</b> and subsequent measurement of coal and macerals.|$|E

Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user.

50|$|Fluckite's mineral {{crystallography}} is triclinic {{meaning it}} has three axis of different length and three different interior angles {{that do not}} equal 90°. Because fluckite possesses three axes with different angles and lengths it is an anisotropic mineral. This means that {{it has more than}} one optic axis. This mineral {{is a member of the}} P space group meaning that it can be rotated 360° degrees and inverted to obtain the original figure. Optically, this mineral has positive biaxial birefringence, which can be shown obtaining an interference figure that is blue in the upper right and lower left quadrants of the figure while looking down the c- axis. Fluckite possesses moderate optical relief which is the degree to which the mineral stands out from the <b>mounting</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Its {{crystal system}} is {{trigonal}} hexagonal scalenohedral with symbol 2/m. It {{belongs to the}} space group Rm. Shandite is an anisotropic mineral, which means it has different properties when being viewed from different directions. In cross-polarized light it appears as gray blue or yellow-brown colors. It also has very distinct relief, which means it stands out against its <b>mounting</b> <b>medium</b> and can be easily seen. It has an index of refraction of 1.54, which is {{the measure of the}} speed of light through the substance. In plane polarized light, shandite has a creamy white color and distinct pleochroism, which is the property that makes it appear to be different colors at different angles. It has strong birefringence, which is the decomposition of light into two rays, and appears dark blue and gray.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{configurations}} {{have the same}} requirements for {{the preparation of the}} sample to be examined. First, the substance of interest must be in intimate contact with the known reference material. In other words, the clean solid must be mounted in a reference liquid, one mineral phase must be in intimate contact with the reference mineral phase, or the homogenous liquid must contain the reference solid. Most applications involve a solid mounted in a reference liquid (referred to as the <b>mounting</b> <b>medium).</b> Second, dispersion colors will only be present if the two materials have the same refractive index for some wavelength in the visible spectrum (referred to as λo) and they have very different dispersions curves for the refractive index. Finally, the sample must be properly mounted under a coverslip to minimize any other optical effect that could complicate the interpretation of the color seen. Once these criteria are met the sample is ready to be examined.|$|E
