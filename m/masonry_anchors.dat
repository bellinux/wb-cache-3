5000|$|The Socialist Hall {{building}} is a two-story building which [...] "is {{an excellent example of}} craftsmanship and design in a two-part commercial block style building." [...] It faces east onto Harrison Avenue with a chocolate colored and beige brick facade. When nominated, it had about fifty <b>masonry</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts stabilizing the front facade.|$|R
5000|$|In 1887, {{the company}} {{moved from the}} corner of Tremont and Court Streets to Copley Square, into a new {{building}} designed by architect S. Edwin Tobey. Architecture critic Robert Campbell has observed of the building: [...] "It's no masterpiece of architecture, but it's great urban design. A heap of dark Romanesque <b>masonry,</b> it <b>anchored</b> a corner of Copley Square as solidly as a mountain." [...] The building was demolished in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system was}} first {{introduced}} by David Biggs, PE in 2007 at the 10th North American Masonry Conference and was based on historical masonry construction [...] {{and the practice of}} <b>anchoring</b> <b>masonry</b> walls in steel frames for out of plane strength.|$|R
500|$|On the church's northeastern {{elevation}} {{there are}} three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod <b>masonry</b> <b>anchor</b> plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation [...] high, due to its location on sloping ground. At {{the center of this}} elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} advanced FE Model experimental tests on masonry wall panel specimens in shear {{as well as}} on some panels strengthened by ductile steel are used. Application of finite element material models to simulate the behavior of masonry is summarized. By using the ABAQUS FE code, a particularly modeling technique has been applied in order to evaluate the nonlinear behavior of masonry walls sheeted with steel plates. The connection between steel plate and <b>masonry</b> (chemical <b>anchors)</b> was simplified in sequence of node to node internal constraints and by using a spring elements.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{presents}} the results of two series of in situ pull-out tests of injected anchors embedded in existing yellow tuff <b>masonry</b> walls. <b>Anchors</b> are made of steel and GFRP bars with diameter of 12 and 20  mm and were embedded by means of two types of grout: a cement-based and a pozzolana-based grout. The results were examined in terms of both maximum load and displacement to determine the most efficient bar-grout coupling. The experimental pull-out forces are also compared with the predictions given by several literature formulas. The second part of the paper is devoted to verify the efficiency of the tested injected anchor systems for avoiding out-of-plane damage mechanisms in masonry walls having varying slenderness and subjected to horizontal forces; to this aim parametric analyses were performed to calculate the seismic acceleration required to activate several out-of-plane mechanisms and to verify the effectiveness of injected anchors similar to those experimentally tested into avoiding them...|$|R
5000|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod <b>masonry</b> <b>anchor</b> plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation 4 ft high, due to its location on sloping ground. At the center of this elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|R
500|$|Repairs of the {{earthquake}} damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost. The church and the Old Chemistry building {{were the only two}} buildings in the university's Inner Quad that were repaired. [...] The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored. [...] "To assure permanence" [...] in case of further earthquakes, the <b>masonry</b> was <b>anchored</b> to its thick, concrete-reinforced walls. [...] The stones were securely bolted to each other, [...] "making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton". [...] The tile floor was replaced with cork. [...] The building's crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before {{the earthquake}}. [...] The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style {{of the rest of the}} buildings in the Inner Quad.|$|R
