40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{investigate}} drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of 17 steroids by examining their inhibitory effects towards 6 major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isoforms. Inhibitory effects of 17 steroids (aldosterone, androstenedione, corticosterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, 11 -deoxycortisol, dexamethasone, estrone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, <b>medroxyprogesterone,</b> megestrol <b>acetate,</b> methylprednisolone, methyltestosterone, prednisolone, prednisone, pregnenolone, and testosterone) at 100 mu M (25 mu M for estrone) were tested towards 6 major P 450 isoforms including CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 E 1, and CYP 3 A 4 in human liver microsomes. The results demonstrated that CYP 3 A 4 was mostly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the steroids. CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 1 A 2 were moderately affected. CYP 2 A 6 and CYP 2 D 6 were the least inhibited. Instead of inhibition, activation was observed towards CYP 2 E 1 by some steroids. Given the limited inhibition and the potential maximal physiological concentrations, these steroids were considered less likely to lead to serious DDI via the inhibition of P 450 in vivo...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, {{accurate}} and sensitive method for simultaneous determination of 15 steroidal hormones including four estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, estriol) and eleven progestogens (17 beta-estradiol- 3 -benzoate, 19 -norethindrone, gestodene. levonorgestrel, <b>medroxyprogesterone,</b> cyproterone <b>acetate,</b> megestrol- 17 -acetate, progesterone, norethindrone acetate, chlormadinone- 17 -acetate, and hydroxy progesterone caproate) in environmental waters {{was developed by}} coupling solid-phase disk extraction (SPDE) to ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization. Among three types of extraction tested (C(8) SPDE, C(18) SPDE and C(18) SPE), the most satisfactory result was achieved using C(18) SPDE for its satisfactory recovery (75. 6 to 101. 4 %) and short extraction time (15 min for 1 L deionised water). The validity of this method was investigated and good analytical performance for all the analytes was obtained, including low limits of method detection (0. 5 - 3. 4 ng/L) and excellent linear dynamic range (1. 0 - 50. 0 ng/L). The method was applied to determine the steroidal hormones in 10 environmental waters including tap water, river water, lake water and waste water in Beijing. No progestogen was detected in all samples and estrone, estriol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol were found in most samples at levels between 1. 8 and 127. 9 ng/L. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Objective: To {{screen the}} {{inhibitory}} effects of 17 steroids on 6 major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Methods: The inhibitory effects of 17 steroids at 100 μM (25 μM for estrone) were tested towards 6 major CYPs including CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 3 A 4. 17 steroids included aldosterone, androstenedione, corticosterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, 11 -deoxycortisol, dexamethasone, estrone, 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone, <b>medroxyprogesterone,</b> megestrol <b>acetate,</b> methylprednisolone, methyltestosterone, prednisolone, prednisone, pregnenolone and testosterone. Results: Of these isoforms tested, CYP 3 A 4 was most affected; {{nearly all the}} 17 steroids inhibited it in certain degree. Dehydroepiandrosterone and methylprednisolone were strongest inhibitors of all steroids tested; CYP 3 A 4 activity was strongly inhibited by 62. 9 % and 61. 9 % respectively. Cortisol, estrone and corticosterone also inhibited CYP 3 A 4 activity by more than 50 %; the activity was inhibited by 57. 4 %, 53. 0 % and 52. 4 % respectively. CYP 2 C 9 and were moderately inhibited, the strongest inhibition was observed by 100 μM corticosterone, 47. 1 % of the orginal activity was inhibited. The activity of CYP 2 C 9 was inhibited by dehydroepiandrosterone by 29. 9 %, methylprednisolone by 26. 7 %, megestrol acetate by 21. 3 %. CYP 2 A 6 and CYP 2 D 6 were the least inhibited. Interestingly, several steroids showed certain degree of activation toward CYP 2 E 1, including androstenedione, estrone (25 μM), medroxyprogesterone, 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone and methyltestosterone, the activity was 150. 8 %, 147. 6 %, 145. 4 %, 133. 7 %, 127. 4 % and 126. 3 % of the control level. Conclusion: Given the limited inhibitory effect and the maximal plasma concentration, these steroids were generally safe; the potential of in vivo metabolim-based drug-drug interactions is quite remote.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: In April 2005 a phase III {{randomized}} {{study was}} started to establish {{which was the}} most effective and safest treatment of cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome and oxidative stress in improving identified primary endpoints: increase of lean body mass, decrease of resting energy expenditure (REE), increase of total daily physical activity, decrease of interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and improvement of fatigue assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventoty-Short Fom (MFSI-SF). Methods: All patients were given as basic treatment polyphenols plus antioxidant agents alpha-lipoic acid, carbocysteine, and vitamins A, C, and E, all orally. Patients were then randomized to one of the following five arms: 1) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate; 2) pharmacologic nutritional support containing eicosapentaenoic acid; 3) L-carnitine; 4) thalidomide; or 5) <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate/megestrol <b>acetate</b> phis pharmacologic nutritional support Plus L-carnitine plus thalidomide. Treatment duration was 4 mo. The sample comprised 475 patients. Results: By January 2007, 125 patients, well balanced for all clinical characteristics, were included. No severe side effects were observed. As for efficacy, an interim analysis on 125 patients showed an improvement of at least one primary endpoint in arms 3, 4, and 5, whereas arm 2 showed a significant worsening of lean body mass, REE, and MFSI-SF. Analysis of variance comparing the change of primary endpoints between arms showed a significant improvement of REE in favor of arm 5 versus arm 2 and a significant improvement of MFSI-SF in favor of arms 1, 3, and 5 versus arm 2. A significant inferiority of arm 2 versus arms 3, 4, and 5 for the primary endpoints lean body mass, REE, and MFSI-SF was observed on the basis of t test for changes. Conclusion: The interim results obtained thus far seem to suggest that the most effective treatment for cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome and oxidative stress should be a combination regimen. The study is still in progress and the final results should confirm these data...|$|R
40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{may lead}} to oxidative stress (OS) in cancer patients. The first one is the altered energy metabolism which may account for symptoms such as anorexia/cachexia, nausea and vomiting which prevent a normal nutrition and thereby a normal supply of nutrients such as glucose, proteins and vitamins, leading eventually to accumulation of free radicals, which are known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and others. The second mechanism is a nonspecific chronic activation {{of the immune system}} with an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn may increase the ROS production. Indeed, a chronic inflammatory condition associated with increased OS has been suggested as one of the triggering mechanisms behind the tumor-induced immune suppression. A third mechanism {{may be the result of}} antineoplastic drugs administration: many of these drugs, particularly alkylating agents and cisplatin, are able to produce an excess of ROS and therefore lead to OS. In turn, OS plays a significant role in inducing and worsening cancer cachexia. Consistent experimental and clinical data indicate that OS is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia, although the extent of its contributory role remains to be established. Therefore, OS should be addressed when developing a therapeutic approach for cachectic cancer patients. To counteract ROS and OS several approaches have been tried both in experimental systems and in humans. Among the most used antioxidant agents there are alpha lipoic acid, cysteine-containing compounds, amifostine, reduced glutathione(GSH) and vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins, which include vitamin C, are hypothesized to decrease cancer risk and prevent cancer progression by trapping organic free radicals and/or deactivating reactive oxygen molecules. Indeed, in our previous experimental and clinical studies in advanced-stage cancer patients we demonstrated: 1) the ability of antioxidant agents alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and N-acetyl cisteine (NAC) to restore in vitro several important T cell functions, and 2) the ability of different antioxidant agents, including vitamin C, used alone or in combination, to reduce in vivo ROS levels and to increase the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. In particular, in two recent studies vitamin C was used as a part of an antioxidant treatment in a combined treatment approach for cancer cachexia. In the first, a Phase II study, the combined treatment approach consisting of antioxidants, including Vitamin C, pharmaconutritional support, progestagen, and an anti-cyclooxygenase- 2, resulted in a significant improvement of symptoms of cancer cachexia. In the second, a phase III randomised study, all patients received a basic antioxidant treatment including Vitamin C plus polyphenols, alpha-lipoic acid, carbocysteine, and vitamins A and E, all orally. Patients were then randomized to one of the following five arms: 1) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate; 2) pharmacologic nutritional support containing eicosapentaenoic acid; 3) L-carnitine; 4) thalidomide; or 5) <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate/megestrol <b>acetate</b> plus pharmacologic nutritional support plus L-carnitine plus thalidomide.

25|$|Progesterone {{was first}} {{isolated}} in pure form in 1934. It first became {{available as a}} medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP), which first allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of manufactured progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> and norethisterone.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion, but oral bioavailability of progesterone {{is low and}} injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with ethisterone, followed by other progestins as they became available: northynodrel (Enovid) and norethisterone (Norlutin) in 1957, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (Provera) in 1959, norethisterone acetate (Norlutate) in 1961, and dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity.

25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone.

Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{specific}} dangers of conjugated equine estrogens were well understood, standard therapy was 0.625mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (such as Premarin). There are, however, {{risks associated with}} conjugated equine estrogen therapy. Among the older postmenopausal women studied {{as part of the}} Women's Health Initiative (WHI), an orally administered conjugated equine estrogen supplement was found to be associated with an increased risk of dangerous blood clotting. The WHI studies used one type of estrogen supplement, a high oral dose of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin alone and with <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> as PremPro).|$|E
25|$|The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI {{reported}} {{an increased risk}} of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and {{an increased risk of}} dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using 0.625mg of Premarin conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI {{reported an}} increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli and DVT in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625mg of CEE with 2.5mg of the progestin <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MPA).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} notable drug {{interactions}} with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline {{may increase the}} GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, as well as inhibitors of 3α-HSD such as <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate,</b> inhibit the conversion of progesterone into its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites, and for this reason, may {{have the potential to}} block or reduce its sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of Cushing's {{syndrome}} is the taking of glucocorticoids prescribed by a health care practitioner to treat other diseases (called iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome). This can be an effect of corticosteroid treatment of a variety of disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, or in immunosuppression after an organ transplant. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Although rare, Cushing's syndrome can also be due to the use of <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate.</b> In this form of Cushing's, the adrenal glands atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, since glucocorticoids downregulate production of ACTH. Cushing's syndrome in childhood usually results from use of glucocorticoid medication.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate).</b> However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked at the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside {{estrogen}} and antiandrogens, progesterone {{is used as}} a component of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for transgender women. However, the addition of progestogens to HRT for transgender women is controversial. Some clinicians and patients believe that progesterone is necessary for full breast development, and for this reason, it is often used with the intention of enhancing breast development. However, a 2014 review stated that [...] "Current evidence does not provide evidence that progestogens enhance breast development in [...] women. Neither do they prove the absence of such an effect." [...] Progestogens are not otherwise known to be involved in physical feminization. In addition, they can produce undesirable side effects, although bioidentical progesterone may be safer and better tolerated than progestins like <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Progesterone, a progestogen, is {{the other}} {{of the two major}} sex hormones in women. Unlike estrogen, {{progesterone}} is not overtly involved in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, and is instead involved mainly in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. For this reason, progestogens are not commonly prescribed for transgender women. However, there may be a role of progestogens in breast development (though controversial and disputed) and in regulation of skin and hair, and progesterone specifically may have positive effects on sex drive, sleep, and levels of anxiety. Moreover, due to their antigonadotropic and/or antiandrogen effects, progestogens can be useful in helping to suppress the effects of androgens in the body. The most common progestogens used in transgender women include progesterone and progestins (synthetic progestogens) like [...] and <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MPA). These drugs are usually taken orally, but may also be administered by intramuscular injection.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{neither the}} WHI nor the Million Women Study {{differentiated}} {{the results for}} different types of synthetic progesterones used.

[...] This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT for menopause. [...] In fact, primate research indicates that {{the side effects of}} MPA may be much worse than those of other synthetic progesterones, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. [...] Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more precisely what the differences in effects are when other synthetic progesterones are used versus natural progesterone in HRT for menopause, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT for menopause.|$|E
