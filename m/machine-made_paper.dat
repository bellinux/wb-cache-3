30|$|As a {{simulation}} of the Elmendorf tearing test, a tearing test method using a tensile tester was proposed {{with the same}} mode of fracture, mode III. Tear indices by both tests were highly correlated for various <b>machine-made</b> <b>papers</b> and laboratory handsheets. The relation between tensile strength and tear strength using the tensile tester {{was similar to that}} between tensile and Elmendorf tear strengths in single-ply mode for both softwood and hardwood pulp sheets. The proposed tearing test is convenient especially for imaging techniques such as thermography, and can help give new insights into the tearing process of paper.|$|R

50|$|<b>Machine-made</b> {{continuous}} <b>paper,</b> just invented, {{was not yet}} {{commercially available}} when Dufour undertook his project. Instead, small rectangular handmade sheets were joined at the edges to form long rolls, which were later cut to the desired length (approximately 24 by 98 inches or 61 × 249 cm). A toned, water-based ground layer was then applied by brush to the entire panel {{to act as an}} undercoat for subsequent printing. This light blue layer also served as the sky tone in unprinted areas. Designs for each color were carved on separate blocks, and as many as sixty were required to print a single panel. The design was then enhanced with stenciled hand-painted gouache.|$|R

30|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy was applied to visualize inside fibers stained with a fluorescent dye, and the fiber orientation distribution in the thickness direction was determined by image analysis from optically sliced images. Fiber orientation angle and anisotropy were determined by the fast Fourier transform method, which holds advantages over the conventionally applied Hough transform with regard to evaluation of fiber width-weighted contribution and intrafiber segmental contribution. An orthogonally layered Japanese paper handmade by the flow-sheet forming method resulted in a clear change of fiber orientation angle from 0 ° to 90 °. <b>Machine-made</b> wood-containing printing <b>paper</b> showed the highest anisotropy, while copier paper showed a low anisotropy. Thick papers like the wood-free paperboard and recycled packaging board showed that the maximum measured thickness was about 150 μm. The depth limit to detect fluorescence was considered {{to depend on the}} apparent density of the paper and the light absorption character of the fibers.|$|R

50|$|China's {{more than}} 1,500 paper mills, {{produced}} approximately 45.4 million tons and over 500 {{different types of}} <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> in 1986. Approximately 1 million tons of pulp and paper were imported annually. In 1986 China focused on pollution control, increased product variety, less use of fiber and chemical ingredients, and more efficient use of energy as measures to improve production. However, China also sought foreign assistance to achieve these goals.|$|E
50|$|Shrinkage is a {{characteristic}} of paper {{because of the nature}} of cellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber is hygroscopic and acts like a sponge when immersed in water. The fibers expand in their width and not in their length. With handmade paper, because there is no direction associated with the fibers, the paper expands and shrinks unevenly in both the length and width of the finished sheet. With <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper,</b> because there is a direction to the fibers, the paper shrinks unevenly, that is, less in its length (in the direction of the fibers) and more in its width (in the direction opposite of the fibers). This characteristic is important to the printer because certain printing techniques required the paper to be dampened prior to printing. As such, when the paper dried, the uneven shrinkage of <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> would produce an image of different proportions than the die that created it. The differences in appearance between wet and dry printed stamps can sometimes be quite noticeable, with dry printed stamps generally having sharper images on stiffer and thicker paper.|$|E
50|$|The first {{postage stamp}} {{issue of the}} Empire of Austria {{was a series of}} {{imperforate}} typographed stamps featuring the coat of arms. At first they were printed on a rough handmade paper, but after 1854 a smooth <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> was used instead. Issues between 1858 and 1861 used a profile of Emperor Franz Josef, then switched back to the coat of arms, in an oval frame. Four clichés of the 1850 issue had St. Andrew's crosses printed per pane so that an even multiple of gulden were paid per pane sold.|$|E
5000|$|A quire {{of paper}} {{is a measure of}} paper quantity. The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality: [...] of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper,</b> while quires of 24 sheets are often used for {{handmade}} or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets.) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, {{depending on the type of}} paper.|$|E
50|$|Watermarks {{are created}} in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or bits, either {{attached}} to the mould or attached to the Dandy roll of <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper.</b> The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods. In {{the case of the}} mould, the watermark is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper. In the case of the Dandy Roll, the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp. The papermaker closely adjusts the pressure the Dandy Roll exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper. Too little pressure and the watermark may not be detectable.|$|E
5000|$|Inherent vice is [...] "the {{quality of}} a {{material}} or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain". Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of this. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries. However, in the mid-19th century, <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of lignin in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the cellulose, which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time. In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone {{to the growth of}} mold, fungi, and bacteria.|$|E
50|$|One {{characteristic}} of <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> {{is that it}} creates a direction or an alignment of the fibers, which directly impacts its strength. This is of particular importance when tearing the paper, as one would do to separate a stamp for use. When the tear is aligned with {{the direction of the}} fibers, the paper will tear evenly. When the tear is opposed to the direction of the fibers, the paper will tear unevenly, in a jagged line. Handmade paper disperses the fibers in unpredictable directions and therefore yields a paper with the most overall strength. A paper’s strength had an influence on the separation methods used for a stamp. For example, a stronger paper may have needed a higher number of perforations per inch to best facilitate the separation of the stamps. Similarly, many stamps have two different standards of perforation for its length and width to optimize the ease of separation while minimizing the cost of manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|A {{change in}} fiber length {{is known to}} change fiber {{flocculation}} and formation of <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper,</b> {{but it has been}} unclear how a change in formation through fiber length affects strength efficiency. (The strength efficiency reflects how well the furnish strength, as indicated by the handsheet strength, is utilized in the <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper.)</b> The effect of fiber length on strength efficiency in twin-wire roll forming was presently investigated by examining two furnishes with different average fiber length, prepared from the same batch of softwood kraft pulp, over a wide range of headbox consistencies on a pilot machine. An increase in fiber length resulted not only in worse Ambertec formation over the whole range of headbox consistencies but also in faster relative deterioration of the formation with increasing consistency. Tensile strength efficiency and Z-strength efficiency were both reduced when the formation was impaired through increased fiber length, and the effect was similar to the effect of a corresponding change in formation through headbox consistency. A given change in formation, through fiber length or headbox consistency, had a larger relative effect on Z-strength efficiency than on tensile strength efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and four previously published articles. The joint empirical focus is papermaking based on textile rags as fibre raw material. Furthermore the physical environment is central in the studies. The relationship between continuity and change is a prevailing theme. The thesis also pays attention {{to the use of}} different sorts of rags and to the connection between this kind of papermaking and the textile industry. The overall purpose is to throw new light upon the paper industry based on rags – a part of early industry seldom mentioned in historical surveys of the industrialization process in Sweden. The aim is also to question the prevalent Swedish historical writing commissioned by the branch, characterized by set divisions between different phases of technical and industrial development, from simple craft to modern industry. One of these borderlines has been drawn between papermaking by hand and papermaking by machine, with the 1830 s as the selected transition period. By studying and analysing changes in the traditional and seemingly static papermaking as well as the opposite: the traditional that has lingered in the new, this thesis shows that the course of events was much more complicated than that. An outcome of the studies is that the industrialization of the rag based paper industry has been a complex, uneven and prolonged process. The first main part of the thesis {{consists of}} two Swedish regional studies centred on the province of Östergötland in a long-time perspective. The focus is mainly on the long continuity of papermaking by hand, which was carried out between 1628 and 1968. The study shows that a variety of types and sizes of mills regarding ownership, forms of production, location, paper qualities and techniques can be identified. Continuity was the dominating feature but within this framework technological and industrial change also took place. The second main part of the thesis has a Nordic perspective and deals with a shorter period, mainly 1830 - 1870. One study examines the introduction of the paper-machine and the establishment of the first <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> mills in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland with special attention given to the Swedish mill Holmen in Norrköping and the Finnish Tammerfors mill, both situated in textile mill towns. A second Nordic study surveys hand-made paper mills founded during and after the time when the paper-machine technology had been established. As the studies show, two parallel development tracks were prevalent in the paper industry in the Nordic countries during the period 1830 - 1870 – papermaking by machine and papermaking by hand. The first paper machines were imported from Britain to some of the oldest and largest paper mills. The introduction of the new technology led to changes in for instance the paper mill buildings and the organization of work regarding the papermaking process. In the preparatory and finishing work manual methods remained, and as before it employed mostly women. At the same time, papermaking by hand continued to change and new hand-made paper mills were founded until as late as the 1890 s. The study discusses possible explanations, among them growing markets for special qualities and combinations with other branches of industry. All the studies show a connection between hand-made paper mills and wool mills on one hand, and <b>machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> mills and cotton and linen mills on the other hand. The paper industry based on rags could in fact be characterized as a kind of textile industryQC 2010112...|$|E

40|$|In my {{work for}} the Index Muscorum it became {{apparent}} that dating problems existed for publications of the years 1825 - 1827, which were important for the nomenclature of Musci. The article by Arnott, Nouvelle disposition méthodique des espèces de mousses, was indicated from 1825 in some sources, but the copy of the periodical consulted had the title—date 1827 and the fascicle conderned probably was issued in 1826, Bridel, Bryologia universa, had the internal date 16 Dec. 1826 in the preface, usually bound with vol. 1 the year 1826 for this volume, therefore, could be doubted. Moreover a supplement to the same volume was apparently published later than the main text, but the date 1827, assigned to this part in the preparation of Index Muscorum, was not fully confirmed. Some of the 11 parts of Schwaegrichen, Species Muscorum [...] . Supplementum, had to be dated with more precision, in connection with other works, th than was possible during the {{work for the}} Index Muscorum. Within the framework of the project Bibliographic Huntiana of the Hunt Botanical Library, Pittsburgh, Pa., it was possible to select a chapter of botanical bibliography, and the bryological publications of these three years were chosen with the literature related thereto. An effort was made to trace every book containing names of Musci. Articles in periodicals were not checked as thoroughly as the books. To bridge the gap between 1825 and 1821, the last year studied by Dr. Sayre in her Dates of publications treating Musci [...] ., bryological publications of the years 1822 - 1824 were studied too, but no effort was made to treat this period exhaustively. The publications included in this thesis are described according to the method of descriptive bibliography, as developed by W. W. Greg, F. Bowers, and for botanical books by Allan Stevenson. This method is adapted to the problems of the books of the period, by omitting the description of some features (binding, type-font) and by using page references in the descriptions of the contents instead of signature references. Some refinements in the method are proposed and applied. A new key for determination of books of handmade paper, especially laid paper, is included, Information concerning the dates of publication was derived from the references to reviews and announcements in contemporaneous periodicals, collected by a team of workers of the Hunt Botanical Library; I checked the original sources in many cases which might be critical. Moreover I studied several manuscript collections in botanical libraries and in archives. Completeness in these two fields, reviews and manuscripts, of course, is impossible, but some important sources remained untapped because of time restrictions. The result is the first analytical bibliography of all publications on a plant group of a certain period, at least to my knowledge. A considerable number of dates of publication are given with more precision than was the case up to now. Some of the important solutions to special problems or new points which came to light are enumerated below. 1. The article of Arnott was published in no less than 5 variants. The first one certainly is the quarto separate, which has the title-date 1825. My research made it probable that this was issued in January 1826. The later variants may be of importance because of indirect references to Schwaegrichen and Gaudichaud. 2. The two volumes of Bridel: Bryologia universa, were indeed published in 1826 and 1827, as the titles indicate; however, the supplement to vol. 1 and the preliminaries were published together with vol. 2. 3. The several parts of Schwaegrichen’s supplements are placed in the chronological order with the other important publications. For some parts, however, more accurate dates would be welcome. 4. The relative dates of Greville: Flora Edinensis, and the relevant fascicle of his Scottish cryptogamic flora were better established than those used in the Index Muscorum. 5. The contents, of the fascicles of a number of books and periodicals were determined, mainly with the help of internal bibliographical evidence. These were in several cases not known to the last details, e. g. Hooker: Musci exotici and Exotic flora. Off-sets of fascicle-titles in a particular copy of the latter work were helpful in establishing the breaks and dates of some fascicles. 6. Some publications were found, of which the new names of Musci were overlooked in the bryological literature (Cambessèdes, Chevallier). 7. The first color prints of mosses, to my knowledge, are indicated: of protonema in T. F. L. Nees von Esenbeck, 1824, and of complete plants in Sommerfelt, 1826, and Chevallier, 1826. 8. Of several books cancellantia are described which were not yet indicated before, including some in the starting-point book, Hedwig: Species Muscorum frondosorum. 9. Wove paper, originally used for expensive paper states of books, apparently became available in larger quantities and at relatively lower prices in the period treated, since several books show a shift from laid to wove paper. <b>Machine-made</b> <b>paper</b> was not yet often used for books; I only saw this paper type with certainty in the Transactions of the Linnean Society [London] of 1827 (see Greville n. 9). As a general result of this research I can discuss the development of bryology in the first three decades of the 19 th century, stressing the application of the natural classification to bryophytes, and the diverse opinions on the life cycle of mosses...|$|E
