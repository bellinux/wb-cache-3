2500|$|The van was {{commonly}} {{said to be}} all-black, but {{the section}} above the red stripe was <b>metallic</b> <b>gray.</b> The angle of the rear spoiler {{can also be seen}} to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts (and including the one displayed in the aforementioned Cars of the Stars Motor Museum) do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third season's [...] "The Bells of St. Mary's", in a scene where Face (his double) jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof. Moments later, in an interior studio shot, Face climbs in through the sunroof. Also, in many stunts where the van would surely be totaled, other makes have been used, such as a black Ford Econoline with red hubcaps painted to simulate the original red turbine mag wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three most}} common arsenic allotropes are <b>metallic</b> <b>gray,</b> yellow, and black arsenic, with gray {{being the most}} common. Gray arsenic (α-As, space group Rm No. 166) adopts a {{double-layered}} structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low Mohs hardness of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73g/cm3. Gray arsenic is a semimetal, but becomes a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.2–1.4eV if amorphized. Gray arsenic {{is also the most}} stable form. Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus (...) [...] Both have four atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least dense, and most toxic. Solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor, [...] It is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97 g/cm3. Black arsenic is similar in structure to black phosphorus.|$|E
