5|$|Electron <b>microscopy</b> {{offers a}} higher {{resolution}} image. In an electron microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional <b>microscopy.</b> In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron <b>microscopy</b> has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron <b>microscopy</b> than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron <b>microscopy</b> is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron <b>microscopy.</b> This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron <b>microscopy</b> techniques. The sample {{is prepared for}} normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light <b>microscopy</b> or transmission electron <b>microscopy.</b> Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron <b>microscopy</b> to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, new {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} study of plants, including methods of optical <b>microscopy</b> and live cell imaging, electron <b>microscopy,</b> analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion <b>microscopy</b> and scanning tunneling <b>microscopy.</b> By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract useful information regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both mechanistic and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion <b>microscopy</b> experiments.|$|E

40|$|Among {{all of the}} {{applications}} of scanning probe <b>microscopies,</b> those that focus specifically on oxides have shown the most growing interest {{during the past three}} years. Notable advances have been made in four fields of applications: the imaging of the topography of oxides with high vertical resolution, the identification of the catalytic sites at the atomic scale, an understanding of the catalytic behavior of oxides at the micrometric scale and the analytical application of scanning probe <b>microscopies</b> to oxides...|$|R
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence <b>microscopy</b> and conventional transmission electron <b>microscopy</b> (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|The use of antigen-based malaria rapid {{diagnostic}} tests (RDTs) {{emerged in the}} 1980s.

David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for biolabels {{that can be used}} in both optical and {{electron}} <b>microscopies,</b> are non-cytotoxic, and do not photobleach. Such biolabels could enable targeted nanoscale imaging of sub-cellular structures, and help to establish correlations between conjugation-delivered biomolecules and function. Here we demonstrate a subcellular multi-modal imaging methodology that enables localization of inert particulate probes, consisting of nanodiamonds having fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy centers. These are functionalized to target specific structures, and are observable by both optical and electron <b>microscopies.</b> Nanodiamonds targeted to the nuclear pore complex are rapidly localized in electron-microscopy diffraction mode to enable "zooming-in" to regions of interest for detailed structural investigations. Optical <b>microscopies</b> reveal nanodiamonds for in-vitro tracking or uptake-confirmation. The approach is general, works down to the single nanodiamond level, and can leverage the unique capabilities of nanodiamonds, such as biocompatibility, sensitive magnetometry, and gene and drug delivery.

40|$|Vibrations {{can cause}} noise in {{scanning}} probe <b>microscopies.</b> Relative vibrations between the scanning sensor and the sample are important {{but can be}} more difficult to determine than absolute vibrations or vibrations relative to the laboratory. We measure the noise spectral density in a scanning SQUID microscope as a function of position near a localized source of magnetic field, and show that we can determine the spectra of all three components of the relative sensor-sample vibrations. This method is a powerful tool for diagnosing vibrational noise in scanning <b>microscopies.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

C.craniiformis features small, well-separated verrucae (wartlike projections) up to 0.2μm tall with rounded tips. In comparison, C.gigantea has larger verrucae (up to 0.4μm tall) that are more irregularly arranged.|$|E

5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron <b>microscopy.</b> As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron <b>microscopy</b> (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

25|$|Optical <b>microscopy</b> and {{electron}} <b>microscopy</b> {{involve the}} diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light <b>microscopy</b> and transmission electron <b>microscopy)</b> or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning <b>microscopy</b> and scanning electron <b>microscopy).</b> Scanning probe <b>microscopy</b> involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of <b>microscopy</b> revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
