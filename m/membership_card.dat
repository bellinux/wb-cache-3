5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's <b>membership</b> <b>card,</b> and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man of integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.|$|E
25|$|However, the 'Bandić problem' {{escalated}} in {{the coming}} months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying {{that he was one of}} the founders of SDP emphasizing that he stood with the party through the good and the bad times. Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> number was 38159.|$|E

25|$|Despite exaggerated {{claims by}} the Temple of 20,000 or more members, one source claims its {{greatest}} actual registered membership was around 3,000. However, 5,000 individual <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> photos {{were located in}} Temple records after its dissolution. Regardless of its official membership, the Temple also regularly drew 3,000 people to its San Francisco services alone, {{whether or not they}} were technically registered members. Of particular interest to politicians was the Temple's ability to produce 2,000 people for work or attendance in San Francisco with only six hours' notice.|$|E

25|$|A {{government}} committee {{delivered in}} June 2011 a report about Cannabis to the Dutch government. It includes {{a proposal that}} cannabis with more than 15 percent THC should be labeled as hard drugs. Higher concentrations of THC and drug tourism have challenged the current policy {{and led to a}} re-examination of the current approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops from end of 2011 was proposed but currently only the border city of Maastricht has adopted the measure in order to test out its feasibility. According to the initial measure, starting in 2012, each coffeeshop was to operate like a private club with some 1,000 to 1,500 members. In order to qualify for a <b>membership</b> <b>card,</b> applicants would have to be adult Dutch citizens, membership was only to be allowed in one club.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, , {{membership}} {{is restricted to}} certain groups only. Trade {{membership is}} available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a <b>membership</b> <b>card.</b> A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K., and as such, {{it would be possible}} for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.|$|E

In July 1958, the Detroit Tigers held a Hall of Fame Day at Briggs Stadium honoring the team's inductees into the Baseball Hall of Fame and also honoring Detroit's two surviving charter {{members of the}} BBWAA. Batchelor appeared in person to accept a plaque from Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick. By 1962, Batchelor was the oldest {{active member of the}} BBWAA and held <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> No. 1 with that organization. In 1965, the Tigers celebrated their 10,000th game in the American League.

25|$|In April 1994, Valley View Center added a frequent-shopper rewards {{program called}} the Smart Shoppers Club. Mall {{management}} said {{they planned to}} spend roughly $500,000 over {{the first two years}} of the program in a bid to increase mall traffic while collecting invaluable demographic data about mall shoppers. Within five months, 9,000 shoppers had joined the club and the mall announced a goal of 20,000 members by the end of 1994. Shoppers logged their visits by swiping their <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> and entering a personal identification number at one of the mall's three touch-screen kiosks. Member benefits included special discount coupons, free gifts, and the chance to win prizes. Club members also received a periodic Shopping Smart newsletter, a Valley View Center shopping bag, plus a birthday card and gift. The Smart Shoppers Club was terminated in late 2000 when it was replaced by a cardless web-based system called Centerlinq. Customers were then able to redeem their old Smart Shoppers Club cards at the mall's customer service desk for a Valley View Center T-shirt.|$|E
25|$|The label was {{originally}} known as The Shinoda Imprint, named after Mike Shinoda. Machine Shop {{was born in}} drummer Rob Bourdon's living room in 1999 when the band was packing CDs and stickers into boxes to send to their very first fans. The label only {{had the potential to}} release the extended plays for the bands fan club annually. Shinoda wanted to release albums of Linkin Park under the label, but the albums were already managed by the parent company Warner Bros. Records, and managing the albums on his alone basis was a difficult job. The first release under the label was for the fan club, LP Underground 2.0, which was released on November 18, 2002. The label also made available some enhanced features, such as T-shirts, sticker, key-chain, a band picture, guitar pick and <b>membership</b> <b>card.</b> The album was co produced by Don Gilmore with Shinoda. On November 17, 2003, the label released another extended play for the LPU fan club, entitled LP Underground 3.0, which featured the unreleased songs in the live album Live in Texas (which was released on November 18, 2003 through the record label).|$|E
25|$|The {{war ended}} in May 1945 and after nearly {{twelve years of}} exile, Ewald Munschke {{returned}} in September {{of the same year}} to Berlin, where there was no longer anything left of his parents' house. The eastern part of the city was under Soviet control: Munschke re-registered his Communist Party membership and was almost immediately given a job within the local party organisation before being appointed, in April 1946, to a position as Communist Party Secretary in the Berlin Police. He remained with the Berlin police department till 1949. In the meantime the German Communist Party was abolished later in April 1946 {{as a result of a}} controversial merger with the more moderately left-wing SPD (party). Within the Soviet occupation zone this established the basis for a return to one-party government. Communist Party members, along with those from the SPD, were invited to sign their membership across to the new SED party, and many did so. Ewald Munschke's own SED Party <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> is dated 1 May 1946. He took a position in the new party's Berlin regional leadership team, later during the decade becoming head of the important personnel department (Kaderabteiling).|$|E

25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special <b>membership</b> <b>card</b> {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's cash card, debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Since {{leaving for}} Spain at age 13, Messi has {{maintained}} {{close ties to}} his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, {{as well as a}} family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text {{with a small group of}} confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of [...] "The Machine of '87" [...] at Newell's Old Boys. Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.

Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it."
