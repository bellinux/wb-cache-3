40|$|This conference {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} extension to a recently published piece of drawing research titled; Nine Drawings (JVAP, 2017). Based around {{a series of}} nine drawings, Nine Drawings forms part of a larger, on-going body of work titled; Metronome Drawing Series (2012 -). As research, {{the aim of this}} work is describing the shape of time using pens, graph paper and a mechanical metronome. The methodology combines a process of repetitively drawing lines ‘in time’ to three different metronome tempos with the phenomenological <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations.</b> The tempos drawn-to are 60, 120 and 180 bpm, represented via green, blue and red lines respectively, while the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> is used to seek the possible beyond the contingency of the given (Ihde, 2012). In Nine Drawings, the objective was using this methodology to investigate Bergson’s idea that time acts as a force, found within the philosophy of la durée (duration). In practical terms, this means Bergson’s idea forms the ‘possible’ understanding that could emerge once the ‘given’ experience of time as duration is taken into account. As a drawing researcher, my interest is in questioning {{the extent to which the}} drawings themselves show evidence of this understanding emerging. 	The extension being discussed here pushes the scope of the Metronome Drawing Series in a more playful direction. The result is a new series of drawings titled; Eighteen Drawings (2017). Made using the same methodology, this series of 18 drawings serves a slightly different objective: the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> is employed to vary the climatic (atmospheric) conditions under which the serial drawing is produced. The inspiration for this idea comes not from Bergson, but from Tim Ingold, who states; “in becoming a linealogist, it is necessary to become something of a meteorologist as well” (Ingold 2015, 53). Without wishing to describe myself as a linealogist, I am interested in Ingold’s idea of necessity in connecting the study of lines (linealogy) with meteorology. As a standalone assertion, it appears similar to Bergson’s notion that time necessarily acts as a force once duration is taken into account – both rely on wedding the experiential to the empirical understanding in order to function. In practical terms, Eighteen Drawings works by varying two things: first, one of a number of possible atmospheric conditions under which drawing can be produced (in this case, humidity) and second, the manner in which the tempos drawn-to are decided, via the agency of chance. The level of humidity is controlled by a household dehumidifier, while chance is employed to select which tempo (60, 120 or 180 bpm) to draw lines ‘in time’ to. Treating this new series as an investigation, or test of Ingold’s idea, means asking the question whether or not the drawings bear any form of witness to it via a study of the lines themselves. As a continuation of my research through drawing describing the shape of time, such a notion is - and remains - an open question...|$|E
40|$|This book {{is based}} on lectures from a one-year course at the Far Eastern Federal University (Vladivostok, Russia) {{as well as on}} {{workshops}} on optimal control offered to students at various mathematical departments at the university level. The main themes of the theory of linear and nonlinear systems are considered, including the basic problem of establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions of optimal processes. In {{the first part of the}} course, the theory of linear control systems is constructed on the basis of the separation theorem and the concept of a reachability set. The authors prove the closure of a reachability set in the class of piecewise continuous controls, and the problems of controllability, observability, identification, performance and terminal control are also considered. The second part of the course is devoted to nonlinear control systems. Using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> and the Lagrange multipliers rule of nonlinear problems, the authors prove the Pontryagin maximum principle for problems with mobile ends of trajectories. Further exercises and a large number of additional tasks are provided for use as practical training in order for the reader to consolidate the theoretical material...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a piece of}} practice-led drawing research titled: Nine Drawings (2016). Treated as a first-person investigation combining serial drawing, Bergsonian philosophy and a postphenomenological methodology, {{the purpose is to}} test the idea of research through drawing by seeking to represent the enigmatic Bergsonian notion that time acts as a force. The methodology employs serially developed drawing to ‘record’ (represent) the drawers experience of time ‘passing’. Treated as a form of praxis which is reflected upon in the drafting of this paper, the process of drawing centres around the effort to draw biro lines ‘in time’ to a ticking metronome. The metronome is set ticking at various increasing tempos, each represented by a different coloured biro ink, and the results displayed across a series of nine graph paper sheets. In conceptual terms, time is interpreted according to Bergson’s philosophy of la durée (duration), while the series is largely assessed using the phenomenological <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations.</b> Considered in terms of research, the assessment seeks both an invariant and a multistable understanding of the phenomenon under consideration – the experientially derived idea that time acts as a force. The nine drawings are presented individually after the conclusion for the reader to refer to, whilst being presented once as a full series. The results of this multifaceted investigation are reported at the end, and offer potential insights into the way in which research through drawing might operate when art and philosophy are combined...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> {{parameters}} {{was introduced}} by the Swiss-born mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) and completed by the Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). [...] A forerunner <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> a celestial body's orbital elements appeared in Euler's work in 1748, while he was studying the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn. [...] In his 1749 study of the motions of the earth, Euler obtained differential equations for the orbital elements; and in 1753 he applied the method to {{his study of the}} motions of the moon. [...] Lagrange first used the method in 1766. [...] Between 1778 and 1783, Lagrange further developed the method both in a series <b>of</b> memoirs on <b>variations</b> in the motions of the planets and in another series of memoirs on determining the orbit of a comet from three observations. [...] (It should be noted that Euler and Lagrange applied this method to nonlinear differential equations and that, instead of varying the coefficients of linear combinations of solutions to homogeneous equations, they varied the constants of the unperturbed motions of the celestial bodies.) During 1808-1810, Lagrange gave the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> parameters its final form in a series of papers. The central result of his study was the system of planetary equations in the form of Lagrange, which described the evolution of the Keplerian parameters (orbital elements) of a perturbed orbit.|$|R
