5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age.|$|E
5|$|Except {{for a few}} {{visits to}} other monasteries, his life was spent in a round of prayer, {{observance}} of the monastic discipline and study of the Sacred Scriptures.

5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit for a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which {{he had in the}} United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|Shiva {{instantly}} agrees {{and drives}} her to Mumbai. Shiva {{tries to get}} into a conversation with Charulatha. She initially refuses to talk, but eventually gives in and tells him about her background. It comes to light that Charulatha's mother, who had always supported her daughter, died after a violent altercation with her father; since then her father has tried to force Charulatha to marry an unknown <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choice. Not willing to bow to her father's wishes, she had escaped from home, but was later found by her father's business partner, Jayaraman, her supposed uncle. He was about to take her to register the marriage arranged by her father when Charulatha tried to escape, leaving him behind at the filling station. Now she wants to head to Mumbai to stay at her grandmother's home.|$|E

5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} also names {{two other}} sons; however, Matheson considered the manuscript {{to be of}} dubious authority, {{since it is the}} only source for these names. It lists Leod's third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. The manuscript continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name there, his descendants were known not as MacLeods, but as MacElliots. The manuscript states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland is a mistake, since John's daughter couldn't have married later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod's fourth son is listed by the manuscript as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod.|$|E

25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future.
