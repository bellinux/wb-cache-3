Oxygen Gen eration Assembly (OGA) and Water Processor Assembly (WPA), critical c omponents of ALSS, {{make use of}} series of granular material packed beds for generation and recycling of oxygen and water. Several granular m aterials {{can be used for}} generation, recycling, processing and recovery of oxygen and water. For example, they may include soft <b>bed</b> <b>media,</b> e. g. ion exchange resins for oxygen generation assembly and hard <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> such as, activated alumina, magchem (Magnesium oxide) and activa ted carbon to remove organic species like ethanol, methanol, and urea from wastewater in Water recovery/processing assembly. These beds are generally packed using a plate-spring mechanism to provide sufficien t compaction to the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> throughout the course of operation. This paper presents results from an experimental study of a full-scale, 3 8. 1 cm (15 inches) long and 3. 7 cm (1. 44 inches) diameter. activated alumina bed enclosed in a cylinder determining its force-displacement behavior, friction mobilizing force, and axial normal stress distribu tion under various axially applied loads and at different levels of packing. It is observed that force-displacement behavior is non-linear for low compaction level and becomes linear with increase in compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> Axial normal stress distribution {{along the length of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> decreased non-linearly with increase in depth from the loading end of the granular media. This paper also presents experimental results on the amount of particulates generated corresponding to various compaction levels. Particulates generated from each of the tests were measured using standard US sieves. It was found that the p articulates and the overall displacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> increased with decrease in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> This effect could be attributed to the greater tendency for inter-particle sliding/rub bing due to smaller internal friction angles, as seen from the shear tests, at lesser initial compacted levels. Upon unloading, it was obse rved that there was no change in displacement (especially rebounding) in the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> This effect could be attributed to the fact that th e porous activated alumina particles fracture/break upon increase in applied load (during loading phase) and occupy void spaces in between the material grains; thereby leading to settling of the media. The lo ad-displacement curve becomes more linear with increase in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> It is concluded that compaction considerabl y affects the load-displacement behavior of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> A series of tests were also conducted on the packed <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> to determine the f orce required to mobilize the friction between the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> and the housing cylinder. The results from these tests showed the existence of significant friction between the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> and the encasing stainles s steel cylinder. Further, it was found that friction effects were more pronounced for media with higher initial compaction. Internal frict ion of the granular media was measured using direct shear apparatus. It was observed that the internal friction increased with increase in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> In this study, a computational m odel (CM) is also developed using finite element software ANSYS to verify experimental results obtained for the distribution of the axial n ormal stress and axial displacement along the length of the full-scal e activated alumina <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> In the computational model, the granular material is considered to have appropriate failure and frictional c ontact exists between the wall and the granular media. It is observed that the model predicts results closely with the experimental method. The compational results show that the axial normal stress distribution along the length of the activated alumina media decreases non-linea rly from the loading end and is negligible beyond a certain depth.

Two different types of configurations were designed for the filter bed. Single <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> consisted of 150 mm depth of silica sand with average particle diameter of 0. 5 mm. Dual <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> consisted of 100 mm depth of granulated charcoal with average particle diameter of 1. 0 mm and 50 mm of silica sand with average particle diameter of 0. 5 mm. Design considerations important to achieving this level of treatment include; pretreatment, media characteristics, hydraulic and organic loading rates and filter dosing techniques. Each sand filter configuration was operated daily for a period of 12 days. The following data were collected on a daily basis: Volume of effluents (mm 3), hydraulic residence time (Hours), unit filter run volume (m 3 /m 2), filtration rate or filtration velocity (mm/hr). Head loss on the filter was calculated using Carmen-Kozeny equation for uniform sand bed. Laboratory investigations showed that effluent from the filter had biological oxygen demand (BOD 5), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity range between 1. 98 – 12. 08 mg/L, 20. 75 – 30. 20 mg/L, 29. 40 – 34. 40 mg/L and 5. 10 – 6. 20 NTU...|$|E

The coagulant was dosed immediately prior to the filter inlet, with subsequent flocculation and deposition occurring in the filter bed. This single stage treatment option was considered appropriate for developing countries, due to observed treatment performance, robustness of operation and reduced treatment costs. This work extends and complements previously successful studies on the treatment of medium to high turbidity raw waters using M. oleifera seed.;Laboratory studies using twin 100 mm diameter filter columns, were undertaken with the following variables: turbidities of 5 - 75 NTU; filtration rates of 5 - 20 m/h; filter depths of 70 and 120 cm; dual and single <b>media</b> <b>beds,</b> and <b>media</b> sizes of 0. 50 - 1. 00 mm and 0. 85 - 1. 70 mm. Deeper <b>beds</b> and smaller <b>media</b> were found to considerably reduce filtrate turbidity when using M. oleifera seed. The consequent headloss increase was only significant with the higher turbidity waters; dual <b>media</b> <b>beds</b> were most effective on such waters. Turbidity removal was reduced at higher filtration rates (10 m/h), due to lower retention times in the bed, and increased detachment of retained particles causing early turbidity breakthrough. Higher filtration rates with another natural coagulant, chitosan, increased turbidity removal and prolonged the time to breakthrough, due to the reduction in surface removal in the filter. At lower loading rates (5 NTU at 5 m/h), removal with M. oleifera seed was comparable with chitosan and aluminium sulphate, with the additional advantage of a lower headloss. Optimisation of the hydraulic variables for a specific coagulant was considered necessary to ensure maximum output and filtrate quality.;Field trials on a low turbidity natural raw water indicated that M. oleifera reduced the turbidity by > 95 % and bacterial numbers by 100 % at the optimum dose.

Tire derived rubber particles (TDRPTM) and other rubber material (ORMTM) are recycled waste rubber products distributed by Envirotech Systems, Inc (Lawton, IA). They {{were found to}} be effective at removing H 2 S from biogas in a previous study. A scrubber system utilizing TDRPTM and ORMTM was tested at the Ames Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) to determine operational conditions that would optimize the amount of H 2 S removed from biogas in order to allow for systematic sizing of biogas scrubbers. Operational conditions tested were empty bed contact time, mass of the <b>media</b> <b>bed,</b> compaction of the <b>media</b> <b>bed,</b> and temperature of the biogas and scrubber media. Additionally, siloxane concentrations were tested before and after passing through the scrubber. The two different types of products, TDRPTM and ORMTM, differed in metal concentrations and particle size distribution. A scrubber system was set up and maintained in the Gas Handling Building at the WPCF from February to December 2009. Results showed that longer contact times, compaction, and higher inlet H 2 S concentrations improved the amount of H 2 S that was adsorbed by the TDRPTM and ORMTM. The inlet H 2 S concentration of the biogas was found to be variable over time and was affected by large additions of fats, oils, and grease (FOG). The effect of temperature was not found to be significant. In excess of 98 % siloxane reduction was observed from the biogas.

The first layer of media is a carbon monoxide catalyst and the second layer of media is universal carbon. During development of Fire Cartridge prototypes, the two <b>media</b> <b>beds</b> were noticed to have shifted inside the cartridge. The movement of media within the cartridge can cause mixing of the bed layers, air voids, and channeling, which could cause preferential air flow and allow contaminants to pass through without removal.

40|$|The Fire Cartridge is {{a packed}} bed air filter with two {{different}} and separate layers of media {{designed to provide}} respiratory protection from combustion products after a fire event on the International Space Station (ISS). The first layer of media is a carbon monoxide catalyst made from gold nanoparticles dispersed on iron oxide. The second layer of media is universal carbon, commonly used in commercial respirator filters. Each layer must be optimally packed to effectively remove contaminants from the air. Optimal packing is achieved by vibratory agitations. However, if post-packing movement of the media within the cartridge occurs, mixing of the bed layers, air voids, and channeling could cause preferential air flow and allow contaminants to pass. Several iterations of prototype fire cartridges were developed to reduce post-packing movement of the media within each layer (settling), and to prevent mixing of the two media types. Both types of movement of the media contribute to decreased fire cartridge performance. Each iteration of the fire cartridge design was tested to demonstrate mechanical loads required to cause detrimental movement within the bed, and resulting level of functionality of the <b>media</b> <b>beds</b> after movement was detected.

These parameters are critical to the engineering of aerobic bioconversion systems and were measured for a straw-manure mixture before and after 13 days of in-vessel composting. Porosity was measured using air pycnometry at four (day 0) and five (day 13) moisture levels, with each moisture level tested at a range of different densities. Tested wet bulk densities varied with moisture level, but dry bulk densities generally ranged from 100 to 200 kg m(- 3). At each moisture/density combination, pressure drop was measured at airflow rates ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 05 m sec(- 1), representing the range of airflow rates found in both intensive and extensive composting. Measured air-filled porosities were accurately predicted from measurements of bulk density, moisture, and organic matter content. Reductions in air-filled porosity at increasing moisture content were accompanied {{by an increase in}} permeability, apparently due to aggregations of fines. This aggregation was quantified by calculating an effective particle size from the Ergun permeability relationship, which increased from 0. 0002 m at 50 % moisture to 0. 0021 m at 79 % moisture. The range of airflow velocities reported in composting systems requires consideration of the second-order drag force term, particularly at velocities approaching 0. 05 in s(- 1) for the higher moisture treatments tested.

40|$|Biological aerated filters {{operate as}} fixed film systems in which {{micro-organisms}} grow on a submerged fixed structured or granular inert support media within an aerated reactor (Stephenson et al., 1993). Periodic backwashing of the filter is required as the <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> gradually clogs {{due to the}} growth of biomass and retention of solids. The advantage of the BAF process is the small footprint it occupies relative to comparable processes such as activated sludge and trickling filters. The small footprint {{is due to the fact}} that the fixed film of biomass on the support material (media) leads to a high concentration of active bacteria per unit volume of the media and thereby to relatively small reactors. Another advantage is the retention of suspended solids that eliminate the need for final sedimentation tanks (Hagedorn et al., 1994). For the same degree of treatment, biofilters require approximately three times less aeration volume than activated sludge units, and twenty times less than trickling filters (Smith et al., 1992).

(MEL™), meets or exceeds all of the design criteria specified by the AWWA for traditional slow sand filtration (TSSF) and TSSF performance expectations. The ability to operate the filter as required and ease of cleaning greatly expands slow sand filter applications. The MEL filter systems (MFS™) include two distinct types – the MEL Biological Filter (MEL-BF™) that is intended to replace TSSF’s and the MEL Polishing Filter (MEL-PF™) that exploits the unique ability of slow sand filtration to remove particulate material and reduce turbidity without reliance on any biological processes. The ability to operate the MEL-BF on a demand basis while retaining the treatment characteristics of TSSF is made possible by recognizing that the biological layer {{on the surface of}} the <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> (schmutzdeke and the active or biolayer) is aerobic. The MEL-BF is designed such that there is always sufficient oxygen available to the biological layer even when there is no flow through the filter thereby keeping it alive. The ability to backwash the MEL-BF without destroying the biolayer is achieved by recognizing that the biological layer consists of the to...|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic <b>media</b> use before <b>bed</b> may interfere with sleep.|$|R
30|$|Many {{species of}} {{mushroom}} are cultivated primarily using sawdust <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> After {{a certain period}} of cultivation, the media cannot be used for mushroom production because the productivity of fruiting body declines even under the optimal conditions of cultivation environment. Related with current energy issue, the potential of mushroom cultural wastes is increasing to utilize as a material for bio-ethanol production [1, 2]. In fact, the spent culture media (SCM) can be converted into sugars, and then they were fermented into ethanol.|$|R
