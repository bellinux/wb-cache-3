5|$|In 1901, Fisher {{was elected}} to the new federal {{parliament}} representing the Division of Wide Bay. He served as <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade</b> and Customs for a few months in 1904, in the short-lived government of Chris Watson. Fisher was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1905, and replaced Watson as leader in 1907. At the time, Labor supported the Protectionist Party minority government of Alfred Deakin. Deakin resigned as prime minister in November 1908 after Labor withdrew their support, and Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own. It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister {{at the head of the}} new Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger of the Protectionists and the Anti-Socialist Party).|$|E
5|$|Returning from Europe in October 1921, he {{was invited}} by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his {{government}} as <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade</b> and Customs. Bruce was not interested he {{was the head of}} one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} seven races in the game, but only TetraCorp (representing the human race) is playable. Upon {{discovering}} an alien race, diplomacy can be initiated in order to arrange actions such as non-aggression pacts and joint-combat treaties, as well as accuse them of spying or trading with the Mauna (Trading with the Mauna is illegal under Federation law). If a faction {{is found to be}} trading with the Mauna, Jane Fong (Federal <b>minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> relations in addition to her role as Terran ambassador for the Fragmented Sectors) can be informed, who will in turn tell the Federation, which could result in increased hostility towards the offending faction from all others or, they can be threatened with blackmail and forced to pay a tribute in return for the players silence. Each race has a unique look and diplomatic strategies and everything happens in real time with highly detailed characters that are well animated and lip-synced. One of the factions — The Mauna, are not members of the Federation and are unable to be negotiated or traded with.|$|E
