This research describes and analyzes a United States Navy Satellite Communications (SATCOM) performance monitoring model in providing status {{information to a}} network monitoring console to support naval operations. The environment is characterized by potentially adverse conditions that affect satellite performance. Current SATCOM systems are unable to provide performance information to the network's performance monitor {{because they are not}} Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enabled and not integrated into the routable network. A network monitoring model defined by sense, decide, and act is central to this study. It represents enhanced monitoring by the subscriber station's <b>monitor</b> <b>console</b> for naval shipboard operations. This model delivers operational and RF environmental information to the SNMP MIB environment so that commonly used SNMP agents can request and send information for sending proper messages to the network's performance monitoring system.

40|$|Dynamic {{testing is}} very {{useful in the}} design and {{development}} of products and systems. Although designers employ most powerful analysis tools, using the most elaborate electronic computers, actual testing is required in order to ensure the proper functioning of the designed system. For the structures that are extremely small such as the Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) or that are very large such as civil and aerospace structures complex dynamic tests can be carried out on a replica of the system, called the model, made to larger or smaller scale, respectively, for reasons of economy, convenience and saving in time. Similitude theory is employed to develop the necessary similarity conditions (scaling laws) for dynamic testing of scaled structures. Scaling laws provide relationship between a full-scale structure and its small scale model, and can be used to predict the response of the prototype by performing dynamic testing on inexpensive model conveniently. Such scaled models have been extensively used in wind tunnel testing of large structures such as automobiles, buildings and aircrafts structures. The difficulty of making completely similar small scale models often leads to certain types of relaxations and distortions from exact duplication of the prototype (partial similarity). Both complete and partial similarities are discussed. These scaling laws are then validated both by carrying out finite element analysis using ANSYS 7. 1, and by performing experiments in the laboratory for a simple structures. The above methodology has also been applied to the design validation of a shipboard <b>monitor</b> <b>console.</b> The console is required to isolate the monitor from the shock and vibration inputs and ensure its proper functioning. The shipboard console and its scale model have been investigated for their dynamic response subjected to sinusoidal and shock loads and a good correlation has been found between the prototype and the model...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{architectural}} design, implementation, configuration and integration of a cyber-security module for a supervision system. A rather standard solution has been followed for the intrusion-detection architecture, comprising a Network-based IDS and a Host-based IDS. While {{the choice of the}} HIDS has been straightforward, the selection of the NIDS required a more in-depth analysis of current technology solutions, and {{has been one of the}} main objectives of this work. The selection of the NIDS has been accomplished by first identifying a few candidate open-source tools using qualitative criteria. Then, a quantitative benchmarking has been performed in two rounds of tests, the first with a test set already used for previous older works, and the second with more specific attacks. This allowed a sound choice of the NIDS. It has been then demonstrated how the chosen tools can be integrated by normalizing their outputs to a standard format and performing correlation having a more comprehensive view of the network. Finally, the cyber-security software module that integrates the IDS architecture with the supervision system has been developed. This module processes the security alerts coming from the intrusion-detection architecture and sends them to the supervision system for displaying onto a central <b>monitoring</b> <b>console...</b>|$|R
