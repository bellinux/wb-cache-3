5|$|The 2s {{electrons}} of beryllium {{may contribute}} to chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding. This <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> burrow near cacti or thistles, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} cactus itself. These thorny plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food. In areas without cacti, the lizards make their burrows in dead trees, hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E

5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> way into the copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of}} the circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 {{miles from the}} nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii {{is one of the most}} geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

5|$|September 10, 1960– Hurricane Donna strikes near Cape Sable after {{crossing}} the Florida Keys, and after briefly moving emerging into the Gulf of Mexico <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> final landfall near Fort Myers. It leaves {{a path of}} destruction across the entire peninsula, including destroying 30% of the state's grapefruit crop and leveling {{over half of the}} mangrove trees in the Everglades. The passage of the hurricane results in 2,156destroyed homes, 3,903severely damaged houses, and 281 boats destroyed or left with major damage. Throughout the state, Donna causes over $300million in damage (1960USD, $2.19billion 2008USD) and 13direct deaths.|$|E
5|$|Significant mammals {{endemic to}} {{forests in the}} bioregion include various species of glider, such as Sugar Gliders (Petaurus breviceps), Feathertail Gliders (Acrobates pygmaeus) and Squirrel Gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) as well as Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) A wide variety of birdlife <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> home in {{wetlands}} in the Riverina, including many migratory species. Competition from introduced species {{and the effect of}} clearing, grazing and pasture improvement has led to a decline in the diversity of native flora and fauna in the area.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{distributed}} throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by Cuban crocodiles. As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana often <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> home within or near prickly-pear cacti.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E

Liu Shanying, {{a political scientist at the}} Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship might be being loosened.|$|E

US223 meets its former routing and turns northwesterly along Lansing Road, crossing {{a branch of the}} Indiana & Ohio Railway. US223 runs parallel to the Adrian & Blissfield Railroad that branches off southwest of the highway. Both the highway and rail line run northwesterly into Blissfield. The two cross while US223 runs along Adrian Street through downtown, and the highway <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> first crossing of the River Raisin before leaving downtown. The second crossing is in Palmyra northwest of Blissfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river <b>makes</b> <b>its</b> wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
