5|$|Multiple {{standards}} {{exist for}} defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC).

5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
50|$|Fetal HSCs are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to SCF <b>than</b> HSCs from adults. In fact, fetal HSCs in {{cell culture}} are 6 times <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to SCF <b>than</b> adult HSCs {{based on the}} {{concentration}} that allows maximum survival.|$|R

5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, which is much <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|The {{modality}} {{of choice}} is computed tomography (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA recent {{paper by}} Knorr et al. (2005 a) {{suggested}} that the decomposition of resistant soil organic matter is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> labile organic matter. In Knorr et al.

Under these conditions, a similar fit to measured data can be obtained without invoking {{the assumption that the}} resistant C pool is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the labile pool. Other published evidence does not unequivocally support Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) hypothesis of increased temperature sensitivity of resistant pools of soil carbon. Because of the lack of experimental data, Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) conclusion that the decomposition of the resistant SOM is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the labile pool is premature...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors {{have been found to}} be {{associated}} with sodium sensitivity. Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race, gender, and age. One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly <b>more</b> salt <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> Caucasians. Women are found to be <b>more</b> sodium <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> men; one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight, as women weigh less than men on average. Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Maus are <b>more</b> {{temperature}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> most breeds—they {{are fond of}} {{very warm}} temperatures. They are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to medicines and anesthesia.

This ice sheet acts like an open refrigerator door, stunting the growth of vegetation along the coastal regions and making recovery a slow process.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{spraying}} of insecticides {{has often}} proven disastrous, as predators of the pests are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the pests themselves.
