40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens.</b> The points covered by this thesis include the principle of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending maritime property in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime lienholders aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the Arrest of Ships!. Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens,</b> is given. The second chapter deals with <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against maritime property. In the third chapter, the enforcement of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the arrest of ships. The right to arrest a sister ship is also considered as well as the issue of arresting a ship chartered by demise charterers. The actual procedure of arrest is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> are discussed -such as the extinction of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens,</b> the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens.</b> The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> and Mortgages and the Arrest of ships. In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with. Finally, in the sbcth Chapter, a brief summary of the project and its scope is made and conclusions are drawn...|$|R

2500|$|In July 1895 {{the board}} of {{directors}} of the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, known as the IR, voted to lease Ocean Wave to the Columbia River and Puget Sound Transportation Company, also known as the CR & PSN and commonly referred to as the White Collar Line. At that time the CR & PSN had on the Columbia River two fast and well-known sternwheelers Telephone and the Bailey Gatzert. [...] One of the IR company directors, Jacob Kamm, did not agree with this decision, and he placed a <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> (called a “libel”) on Ocean Wave for $17,851 for services provided by Kamm’s firm, the Vancouver Transportation Company. [...] While Kamm and Loomis were both on {{the board of}} directors of the IR, a disagreement between them had arisen, reportedly because Ocean Wave, designed by Kamm, had proven to be a slower boat than Loomis had wanted.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{significant}} differences between <b>maritime</b> <b>liens,</b> which only exist in admiralty law, {{and the right to}} keep that exist in general civil law are (1) that in general civil law, [...] "Prior in time is prior in right", i.e., the rights of the lienholder with the earliest lien are superior to those of later lienholders, whereas in maritime law the rights of the most recent lienholder are superior, and (2) all <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> are superior to all non-maritime liens. For instance, in the United States, a federal tax lien, which is a non-maritime lien, is subordinate to every lien for supplies, fuel, repairs, etc., which are all <b>maritime</b> <b>liens.</b>|$|R

Part II analyzes the dominant approach, which applies admiralty principles when the sale of a vessel is mandated. Part III {{argues that a}} better approach uses bankruptcy principles, which enable a bankruptcy court to maintain jurisdiction over vessels subject to <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> and to sell these vessels free of such liens. This Note concludes that the proper courseis to refer pending maritime foreclosures to, and consolidate a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets under, the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court...|$|R
5000|$|Under English law, no <b>maritime</b> <b>lien,</b> {{as defined}} by the US courts, exists on the vessel, so the ship is not subject to a Rule C arrest.|$|E
50|$|Normally, a <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> {{relates to}} the {{different}} marine transactions in the admiralty jurisdiction and creates the maritime claims. It will be created by the statute such as the Ship Mortgage Act.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lienholder}} {{could give}} up the right of <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> either by expressed or implied intention. The intention to waive the lien should be shown clearly required by the court and the credit of the lienholder will be considered.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "super priority" [...] {{status is}} {{construed}} broadly, {{and has been}} held to even defeat statutory deemed trusts (such as those concerning pension plan deficiencies and vacation pay that exist in Ontario), {{as well as in}} rem claims such as <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> that are found in maritime law.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} clauses under the sales form {{protecting}} {{the interest of}} the buyer of ship. For example, clause 9 of Sale Form 1993 has provided some limited protection for the buyer. Under the clause 9, the seller warrants that the vessel is free from all charters, encumbrances, mortgages and <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> or any other debts whatsoever at the time of delivery. The buyer can claim against the seller for all consequences of claims make against the vessel which have been incurred prior to the time of delivery. If the ship cannot settle down all the mortgages and other claim attached to the ship before the delivery, the buyer can discharge the purchase price to cover this part of claim. Normally, the buyer would also retain part of the payment for around six months to secure there is no any claims and <b>Maritime</b> <b>Liens</b> of the ship.|$|R
25|$|Admiralty {{law and the}} Law of the Sea lay a basic {{framework}} for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as salvage, <b>maritime</b> <b>liens,</b> and injuries to passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Although the <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> is {{attached}} to the maritime property whoever the shipowner is, it is possible to discharge or eliminate the lien by several ways. They include payment of the claims, waiver, laches, foreclosure, and sale or destruction of the res.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{proprietary}} lien where interest {{is about the}} property. It should be understood that “res” may be the vessel (including its appurtenances and equipment), the cargo, the freight or even the proceeds of sale. The rights include jus in re (right on the property) and jus in rem (right against the property). The doctrine of <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> is that a ship will {{be treated as a}} wrongdoer, not the owner, that the loss, damage or harm is caused by the maritime property, itself, and it has to make good for the loss. The attachment of <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> will start when the cause of action arises and will not be eliminated even by change of ownership in a good faith purchase.|$|E
50|$|The {{claim is}} {{enforceable}} in personam and in rem. The ship or the sister ship {{can be held}} in lien to enforce the claim. A property salvage attracts a <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> against all property saved; however, the liability salvage (special compensation under Article 14) does not.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{with the}} {{protection}} clause to the buyer in Norwegian Sales Form 1993, [...] "the Sellers warrant that the Vessel, {{at the time}} of delivery, is free from all charters, encumbrances, mortgages and <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> or any other debts whatsoever." [...] For buyers, registration of ships with mortgages is particularly important to avoid future litigation after sales due to claims related to unregistered mortgages.|$|R
5000|$|However, it is {{difficult}} for the buyer to terminate the contact even if the vessel still has some encumbrances, mortgages or <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> at the time of delivery. Under the English law, the [...] "warranty" [...] is a contractual promise which is not the condition of the contract, so the innocent party can only claim damages but not terminate the contact if there is breach of warranty. Thus, it {{is difficult}} for the buyer to terminate the contract.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{plea for}} the {{adoption}} of the broad generalization laid down in The Bold Buccleugh, that all <b>maritime</b> <b>liens,</b> from whatever source arising, are to be paid in the inverse order of their accrual. It was said in that case that 2 ̆ 2 This rule which is simple and intelligible, is in our opinion applicable to all cases. 2 ̆ 2 Yet though The Bold Buccleugh has been approved in principle both by the House of Lords and by our own Supreme Court, the generalization logically deducible from that principle has not been formally adopted by either of those high tribunals. The result is that much uncertainty still exists in the decisions and the textbooks as to the underlying principle controlling priorities among <b>maritime</b> <b>liens.</b> An exception to the above generalization should probably be made in favor of liens for mariners 2 ̆ 7 wages, not only for the traditional and sentimental reasons intimated in the John G. Stevens, but on the more solid ground that such liens cannot be treated as secret liens since everybody knows that mariners are not paid in advance. Local rules for arbitrarily determining what liens for supplies and repairs shall be deemed contemporaneous, and so of equal rank, are also excepted...|$|R
50|$|In {{admiralty}} law, a <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> is {{a privileged}} claim upon sea-connected property, {{such as a}} ship, for services rendered to, or the injuries caused by that property. In common law, a lien is {{the right of the}} creditor to retain the properties of his debtor until the debt is paid.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} a list {{recognized}} by the admiralty jurisdiction, the definitions and criteria {{are not the same}} under the maritime law of differing jurisdictions. For example, bunker suppliers are not protected by <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> under UK law. However the supplier of bunker goods has the right of lien in the US.|$|E
50|$|A <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> is a lien on a vessel, {{given to}} secure the claim of a {{creditor}} who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are {{sometimes referred to as}} tacit hypothecation. Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|The {{sale and}} {{purchase}} of ship {{is one of}} the most complicated procedures in the shipping industry - far more complicated compared to a new building contract of a ship for example. The S&P contract involves different kinds of professional knowledge as well as strong negotiation skills. Furthermore, due to the legal effect raised by the <b>Maritime</b> <b>liens</b> attach to the second-hand ship, the buyer should check the history and any court writs to reduce any future loss from the purchased ship. Thus, with regard to the complicated issues of this market, a professional shipbroker takes an important role during the transaction.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is common}} but {{inaccurate}} {{to use the}} terms [...] "stevedore" [...] and [...] "longshoreman" [...] interchangeably. [...] However, even the U.S. Congress has done so in the Ship Mortgage Act, 46 app. U.S.C. section 31301(5)(C) which designates both [...] "crew wages" [...] and [...] "stevedore wages" [...] as preferred <b>maritime</b> <b>liens.</b> The intent of the statute was to give the wages of the seamen and longshoremen {{the same level of}} protection. Nevertheless, sometimes the word [...] "stevedore" [...] is still used to mean [...] "man who loads and unloads a ship" [...] as the British [...] "docker".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Admiralty and {{maritime}} law {{has a significant}} element of internationality. It takes meaningful form not only in national laws {{but also as a}} body of principles largely common to shipping and trading nations. Admiralty law there are some unique concepts such as admiralty jurisdiction, charter parties, demurrage, dispatch, bill of lading etc. Admiralty jurisdiction generally refers to the authority of a nation to hear certain types of cases arising from actions that occur on the high seas or other navigable waters. The jurisdiction might also extend to contract disputes that relate to {{maritime law}}, such as contracts concerning payment of wages to seamen, transportation of persons or cargo, <b>maritime</b> <b>liens...</b>|$|R

50|$|However, the US {{courts will}} choose the factors {{which could be}} applied to protect the American. If the {{relevant}} factors direct to select international law, the case may be dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens.

50|$|Attachment is not dependent, as is {{arrest in}} rem, on the {{existence}} of a <b>maritime</b> <b>lien</b> or preferred mortgage lien, but necessitates merely an in personam claim against the defendant which falls within U.S. admiralty jurisdiction. It does not require the applicant to show that the attachment is necessary to satisfy a potential judgment. Unlike in rem proceedings, the property that can be attached is not restricted to maritime property, and it may be either tangible or intangible.|$|E

The question concerned is whether the Standard Oil were entitled to <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> for fuel oil delivered to Dannebrog's vessels. Dannebrog had chartered two ships - the 'Stjerneborg' and the 'Brand' - to W. L. Comyn & Sons in May 1933.

It provides an overview of the related international conventions as well as the developments of maritime law in Estonia. First,the study introduces two conventions on the arrest of ships:the Brussels Convention of 1952 and the Geneva Convention of 1999 ① and two conventions on <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> & mortgages:the Brussels Convention of 1926 and the Geneva Convention of 1993 as well as relevant developments in the national law of Estonia. Second,it analyzes the different nature and qualities of maritime liens,sometimes called privileged claims and respective enforcement procedures. Through this paper some practical problems are discussed in relation to the arrest of vessels and their release in Estonia which of course are of importance for any flag State or person involved in maritime business. ［文摘］本文旨在考察诉讼前船舶扣押的国际法律框架和爱沙尼亚相关国内立法以及实践,介绍相关国际公约和爱沙尼亚海商法发展的概况。第一,本文介绍了关于船舶扣押的两部国际公约———《 1952 年统一海船扣押某些规定的国际公约》和《 1999 年国际扣船公约》,①以及《 1926 年统一船舶优先权和抵押权某些法律规定的国际公约》和《 1993 年船舶优先权和抵押权国际公约》这两部有 关船舶优先权和抵押权的国际公约,以及爱沙尼亚相关国内法的发展情况。第二,本文分析了有时被称为“有特权的请求”的船舶优先权的性质、所包含项目以及执行程序。本文也讨论了爱沙尼亚法下船舶扣押和释放被扣押船舶的一些实践问题,这些问题对于海事业务中所涉船旗国或个人有重要参考价值...|$|R

The final version is available from Kluwer via the links in this record. This monograph covers transportation law in Greece. It {{is part of a}} unique series of looseleaf publications by Kluwer, currently comprising of 25 distinct reference works in various areas of law / subjects (one of which is Transport Law). Each of the subsets is itself encyclopaedic in nature, covering a major field of law with penetrating country-by-country monographs that describe how each national legal system governs the relevant field. These national monographs are supplemented where relevant with international monographs which detail the workings of supranational organisations that affect the field of law in question, or offer an overview of the field from a comparative perspective. The International Encyclopaedia for Transport Law contains national monographs in this subset of the International Encyclopaedia of Laws. For each jurisdiction transport law in its broadest sense is examined. IN relation to Greece, jurisdiction, state immunity, and the main sources of transport law is set out. With reference to maritime law, the reader will find information on the legal status of the vessel, its acquisition, ownership and registration. Other topics discussed are <b>maritime</b> <b>liens</b> and mortgages, the position of master and crew, liability and limitation of liability (L. L. M. C. Convention 1976), charter parties and Transport under Bill of Lading (Hague-Visby Rules), transport by air (Warsaw Convention and related conventions), transport by rail (C. O. T. I. F.
