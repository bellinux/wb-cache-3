The beneficial effects of DR involve a <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> toward increased triglyceride usage. The regulatory mechanism and the tissue specificity of this metabolic switch remain unclear. Here, we show that the IRE 1 /XBP 1 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling module mediates <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> upon DR in flies by promoting triglyceride synthesis and accumulation in enterocytes (ECs) of the Drosophila midgut. Consistently, IRE 1 /XBP 1 function in ECs is required for increased longevity upon DR. We further identify sugarbabe, a Gli-like zinc-finger transcription factor, as a key mediator of the IRE 1 /XBP 1 -regulated induction of de novo lipogenesis in ECs. Overexpression of sugarbabe rescues metabolic and lifespan phenotypes of IRE 1 loss-of-function conditions.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of metabolic activity by tuning enzyme expression levels {{is crucial to}} sustain cellular growth in changing environments. Metabolic networks are often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and optimization techniques. However, <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptations</b> driven by changes in gene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not account for temporal changes in biomass composition. Here we present a dynamic optimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics of biomass production and composition, explicitly taking into account enzyme production costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic flux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both the metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptations.</b> We applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake network, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the minimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical Monod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic processes, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptations,</b> such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for different nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the original substrate, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> to an impending nutrient depletion.

Growth is gradually recovered as the organism adapts to the new condition. This adaptation can be modeled as a process of repeated met-abolic adjustments obtained through the resilencings of the non-essential metabolic reac-tions, using growth rate as selection probability for the phenotypes obtained. The resulting <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> process tends naturally to steer {{the metabolic}} fluxes towards high growth phenotypes.

Author Summary In modeling metabolic networks, concepts like biomass optimization are often used to determine flux distributions of simple organisms such as E. coli. Although they often give good results in practice, they normally rely on heuristic considerations like “evolution has tuned metabolic fluxes to optimize growth, hence optimizing growth gives reasonable fluxes”.

Chronic respiratory uncoupling of HepG 2 cells induced an increase in cellular oxygen consumption, oxidative capacity and cytochrome c oxidase activity. This was associated with an upregulation of COXIV and ANT 3 gene expression, two nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Glucose consumption, lactate and pyruvate production and growth rate were unaffected, indicating that <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> of HepG 2 cells undergoing chronic respiratory uncoupling allows continuous and efficient mitochondrial ATP production without the need to increase glycolytic activity. In contrast, 3 days of dinitrophenol treatment did not change the oxidative capacity of human 143 B. TK− cells, but it increased glucose consumption, lactate and pyruvate production. Despite a large increase in glycolytic metabolism, {{the growth rate of}} 143 B. TK− cells was significantly reduced by dinitrophenol-induced mitochondrial uncoupling.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli, the posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr was postulated {{to influence the}} transition from glycolysis to gluconeogene-sis. Here, we explored {{the role of the}} Csr system in the glucose-acetate transition as a model of the glycolysis-to-gluconeogenesis switch. Mutations in the Csr system influence the reorganization of gene expression after glucose exhaustion and disturb the timing of acetate reconsumption after glucose exhaustion. Analysis of me-tabolite concentrations during the transition revealed that the Csr system has a major effect on the energy levels of the cells after glucose exhaustion. This influence was demonstrated to result directly from the effect of the Csr system on glycogen accumulation. Mutation in glycogen metabolism was also demonstrated to hinder <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation</b> after glucose exhaustion because of insufficient energy. This work explains how the Csr system influences E. coli fitness during the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switch and demonstrates the role of glycogen in maintenance of the energy charge during <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation.</b> IMPORTANCE Glycogen is a polysaccharide and the main storage form of glucose from bacteria such as Escherichia coli to yeasts and mammals. Although its function as a sugar reserve in mammals is well documented, the role of glycogen in bacteria is not as clear. By studying the role of posttranscriptional regulation during <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation,</b> for the first time, we demonstrate the role of sugar reserve played by glycogen in E. coli. Indeed, glycogen not only makes it possible to maintain sufficient energy during metabolic transitions but is also the key component in the capacity of cells to resume growth. Since the essential posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr is a major regulator of glycogen accumulation, this work also sheds light on the central role of posttranscriptional regulation in <b>metabolic</b> <b>adaptation...</b>|$|R

It {{is not a}} diet, but rather a nutritional concept that refutes any diet that promotes cutting out entire foods or food groups as a method to lose weight. It is a structured and science-based method of eating that involves tracking calories through monitoring the three main macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Flexible dieting is a disciplined method of eating that teaches individuals how to modify macronutrient intake {{in order to reach}} personalized physique, fitness, and health goals. The goal of incorporating flexible dieting is to empower individuals in their fitness journey to gain control over their goals through utilizing a knowledge base of nutrients and how the body responds to them.

One-year-old seedlings of flood-tolerant river birch (Betula nigra L.) and flood-intolerant European birch (Betula pendula Roth) were transferred to solution culture, and the solutions were bubbled with air or nitrogen.

Adenylate energy charge of river birch roots decreased between 6 and 12 days of hypoxia. In contrast, energy charge of European birch roots decreased after only 1 day of hypoxia. In vitro activity of cytochrome c oxidase and oxygen consumption capacity of excised roots from both birch species decreased under hypoxia.
