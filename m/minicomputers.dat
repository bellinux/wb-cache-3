5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, {{mainframe}} {{computers and}} <b>minicomputers</b> were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers. Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal computers later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or <b>minicomputers,</b> and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such as the BASIC programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe.|$|E

She and William Bartik divorced in 1968. Bartik ultimately retired from the computing industry in 1986 when her final employer, Data Decisions, closed down; she spent the following 25 years as a real estate agent. She died from congestive heart failure in a Poughkeepsie, New York nursing home on March 23, 2011.|$|E
5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is {{sent back to}} the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand <b>minicomputers</b> at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E

50|$|In the {{software}} context, the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by <b>minicomputer</b> OSs (such as CP/M's similarity to Digital's single user OS/8 and RT-11 and multi-user RSTS time-sharing system). Also, the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by, or directly descended from, <b>minicomputer</b> OSs. UNIX was originally a <b>minicomputer</b> OS, while Windows NT kernelâ€”the foundation for all current versions of Microsoft Windows-borrowed design ideas liberally from VMS. Many {{of the first}} generation of PC programmers were educated on <b>minicomputer</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|PRIMOS is a {{discontinued}} {{operating system}} {{developed during the}} 1970s by Prime Computer for its <b>minicomputer</b> systems. It rapidly gained popularity and by the mid-1980s was a serious contender as a mainline <b>minicomputer</b> operating system. With the advent of PCs {{and the decline of}} the <b>minicomputer</b> industry Prime was forced out of the market in the early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s <b>minicomputers</b> {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These {{machines}} contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed <b>minicomputers,</b> led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E
5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and <b>minicomputers</b> through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E
50|$|A 12-bit <b>minicomputer,</b> {{called the}} CDC 160, was {{often used as}} an I/O {{processor}} in 1604 systems. A stand-alone version of the 160 called the CDC-160A was arguably the first <b>minicomputer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of <b>minicomputer</b> is vague with the consequence {{that there are}} a number of candidates for the first <b>minicomputer.</b> [...] An early and highly successful <b>minicomputer</b> was Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) 12-bit PDP-8, which was built using discrete transistors and cost from US$16,000 upwards when launched in 1964. Later versions of the PDP-8 took advantage of small-scale integrated circuits. The important precursors of the PDP-8 include the PDP-5, LINC, the TX-0, the TX-2, and the PDP-1. DEC gave rise to a number of <b>minicomputer</b> companies along Massachusetts Route 128, including Data General, Wang Laboratories, Apollo Computer, and Prime Computer.|$|R
50|$|Nord-5 was Norsk Data's first 32-bit <b>minicomputer,</b> and is {{believed}} to be the first 32-bit <b>minicomputer.</b> The machine used a Nord-1 as its front-end console processor, which ran the majority of the OS.|$|R
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 <b>minicomputers.</b> The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E

In nine months, the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) had increased its staff from 22 to 3500, opened 81 offices, installed 31 <b>minicomputers,</b> 633 terminals and 10 medium-sized computers linked by land-lines {{to the central}} computer, and issued registered health insurance cards to 90% of the Australian population.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1988 Nokia {{bought the}} {{computer}} division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated {{as a computer}} division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, <b>minicomputers</b> and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.|$|E

50|$|For example, the <b>minicomputer</b> {{industry}} began, grew up, got big, profitable, smug, senile {{and died}} in 20 years from 1975 to 1995. Digital Equipment Corporation is a prime exemplar. In this case the topple rate of the <b>minicomputer</b> industry was 20 years.|$|R
50|$|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) {{was once}} the leading <b>mini{{computer}}</b> manufacturer, at one time the second-largest computer company after IBM. But as the <b>minicomputer</b> declined {{in the face of}} generic Unix servers and Intel-based PCs, not only DEC, but almost every other <b>minicomputer</b> company including Data General, Prime, Computervision, Honeywell and Wang Laboratories, many based in New England (hence the end of the Massachusetts Miracle), also collapsed or merged. DEC was sold to Compaq in 1998, while Data General was acquired by EMC Corporation.|$|R
25|$|The {{new company}} {{was plagued by}} {{internal}} disputes over which suit to base the new product on {{and a large number}} of customers disputes, leaving little capacity for product development. At the time software developers had low margins. The companies had been bought with a short-term goal to sell more <b>minicomputers</b> and ND lacked a strategic plan for them. The problem was accelerated because the sales force lacked intricate knowledge of the industries they were selling to.|$|E
25|$|The subsea VardÃ¸ Tunnel {{opened in}} 1982 {{and since the}} country has built subsea tunnels to connect island {{communities}} to the mainland. From the 1980s, the largest cities introduced toll rings to finance new road projects. A banking crisis hit Norway in the late 1980s, causing the largest banks, such as Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, to be nationalized. Norsk Data, a manufacturer of <b>minicomputers,</b> became Norway's second largest company by 1985, just to go bankrupt by 1993. Unemployment reached record-high levels in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data (ND) was a Norwegian {{manufacturer}} of <b>minicomputers</b> which operated between 1967 and 1992.

The company {{was founded by}} Lars Monrad-Krohn, Rolf SkÃ¥r and Per BjÃ¸rge, three computer engineers working at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment which had just built the minicompter SAM 2. ND's first contract was the delivery of a Nord-1 computer to Norcontrol. Initially in competition with Kongsberg, ND started delivering computers to Norwegian institutions. By 1972 the company had developed Sintran operating system, the 32-bit Nord-5 and a time sharing system.|$|E

25|$|Fifty-one {{municipalities}} {{applied to}} join the project and fourteen were selected. The computing industry warned against the proposals, which would use ND's proprietary <b>minicomputers</b> instead of open standard servers and personal computers. Another concern which was voiced was that if fifteen new computing centers were to be established, it would either {{have to be at}} the expense of existing major centers, such as the Norwegian Computing Center and SINTEF, or would have to receive subsidies. The project was also disapproved of by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education and Research and the Regional Development Fund, but the issue was carried through by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Intel 80386 CPU chip in October 1985, with 32-bit architecture and paging capabilities, provided personal computers {{with the ability to}} run multitasking operating systems like those of earlier <b>minicomputers</b> and mainframes. Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler, who had developed the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation. He would lead the development of the Windows NT operating system, which continues to {{serve as the basis for}} Microsoft's operating systems line. Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Inc., started NeXT Computer Inc., which developed the NEXTSTEP operating system. NEXTSTEP would later be acquired by Apple Inc. and used, along with code from FreeBSD as the core of Mac OS X (macOS after latest name change).|$|E
25|$|Many early computers, {{including}} the CDC 6600, the LINC, the PDP-1, and the UNIVAC 1107, use ones' complement notation; {{the descendants of}} the UNIVAC 1107, the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, continue to do so. The IBM 700/7000 series scientific machines use sign/magnitude notation, except for the index registers which are two's complement. Early commercial two's complement computers include the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-5 and the 1963 PDP-6. The System/360, introduced in 1964 by IBM, then the dominant player in the computer industry, made two's complement the most widely used binary representation in the computer industry. The first minicomputer, the PDP-8 introduced in 1965, uses two's complement arithmetic as do the 1969 Data General Nova, the 1970 PDP-11, and almost all subsequent <b>minicomputers</b> and microcomputers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{problems}} are discussed of selecting and implementing a <b>minicomputer</b> system, with particular {{reference to the}} key stages in the various decision making processes involved. Following {{a brief description of}} a typical <b>minicomputer,</b> the range and purpose of the various system inputs and outputs is presented. This leads to discussion of: the function of the system; the type of equipment required to implement that function (which may or may not involve a minicomputer); the class of <b>minicomputer</b> suited to that requirement, assuming some form of <b>minicomputer</b> is appropriate; the type of system which should be purchased-i. e. in terms of hardware, software, systems support- with special reference to the individual responsibilities of user and supplier; criteria affecting the choice of supplier; and the particular items of software and hardware which should be bought. Close attention is paid to the sequence and interaction of the decision relevant to these topics, nonobservance of which often leads to considerable difficulty during the implementation and commissioning of the system. The article is intended for the relative newcomer to the <b>minicomputer</b> field who requires basic guidance in the optimum approach to <b>minicomputer</b> implementation in order to avoid some of the many obstacles with which he might otherwise be faced. ...|$|R
50|$|TurboIMAGE is one {{of several}} names used to refer to a {{database}} developed by Hewlett Packard and included with the HP3000 <b>minicomputer.</b> TurboIMAGE was also available on the HP250 <b>minicomputer.</b> Originally released under the name IMAGE/3000 in 1972, it was later known as TurboIMAGE, IMAGE/SQL, and TurboIMAGE/XL.|$|R
50|$|TI later {{developed}} {{the more powerful}} and more capable TMS99000 family of microprocessors, which {{was used as the}} CPU in the 990/10A <b>minicomputer</b> as a cost reduction. Unfortunately, by the time the 990/10A made it to market, the end of the <b>minicomputer</b> era was already in sight.|$|R
25|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} the rapid {{improvement}} in microcomputers, {{and especially the}} introduction of the graphical user interface and data-rich application programs like Lotus 1-2-3 led to an increasing interest in using personal computers as the client-side platform of choice in client-server computing. Under this model, large mainframes and <b>minicomputers</b> would be used primarily to serve up data over local area networks to microcomputers that would interpret, display and manipulate that data. For this model to work, a data access standard was a requirement â€“ in the mainframe field it was highly likely that all of the computers in a shop were from one vendor and clients were computer terminals talking directly to them, but in the micro field there was no such standardization and any client might access any server using any networking system.|$|E
25|$|A {{strategic}} {{cooperation with}} Norcontrol started in November 1967, when Norsk Data bought shares for NOK200,000 in Norcontrol, which again bought shares for NOK70,000 in Norsk Data. Norcontrol placed {{the first order}} for a Norsk Data computer on 26 January 1968. Shortly afterwards computers were ordered by the Central Institute for Industrial Research and the Chr. Michelsen Institute. Norsk Data and Kongsberg signed a market sharing agreement on 23 April 1968, in which Kongsberg would deliver computers to the military industry while Norsk Data would deliver to the civilian sector. In the early years, Kongsberg {{would continue to be}} Norsk Data's main competitor as the only other Norwegian manufacturer of <b>minicomputers.</b> Additional Norsk Data shares were issued in May 1968, bringing the share capital to NOK894,000. New investors included Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB), Habberstad and Tharald BrÃ¸vig.|$|E
25|$|The {{first few}} {{generations of the}} Alpha chips {{were some of the}} most {{innovative}} of their time. The first version, the Alpha 21064 or EV4, was the first CMOS microprocessor whose operating frequency rivalled higher-powered ECL <b>minicomputers</b> and mainframes. The second, 21164 or EV5, was the first microprocessor to place a large secondary cache on chip. The third, 21264 or EV6, was the first microprocessor to combine both high operating frequency and the more complicated out-of-order execution microarchitecture. The 21364 or EV7 was the first high performance processor to have an on-chip memory controller. The unproduced 21464 or EV8 would have been the first to include simultaneous multithreading, but this version was canceled after the sale of DEC to Compaq. The Tarantula research project, which most likely would have been called EV9, would have been the first Alpha processor to feature a vector unit.|$|E
