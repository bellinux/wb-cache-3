5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E

Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio's financial interests to Welles's creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut. After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939. The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, the routing of I-40 west of Kingman {{was being}} reconsidered from the planned route through Needles, California to a {{route to the}} north passing through Searchlight in {{southern}} Nevada and connecting with I-15 further north of its present connection with I-15. [...] The rationale for the proposal {{was that it would}} be an overall shorter route and would cost <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> construct. [...] The proposal was met with stiff opposition including all four U.S. senators from California and Arizona sending the Secretary of Commerce letters requesting that the routing through Needles be retained. [...] This proposal was eventually abandoned in 1966 and the routing through Needles was kept.|$|E

500|$|Comparing [...] "Sunshine Life for Me" [...] {{with the}} devout lyrical content of Living in the Material World, Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner opined {{that with this}} song Harrison had [...] "managed to be amusing {{for the first time}} in years". NME critic Bob Woffinden admired the track as [...] "a sort of update of 'Mother Nature's Son'" [...] on an album that {{conveyed}} [...] "a zestfulness, an unashamed joie de vivre". Less impressed, Michael Benton of Disc found that the song represented [...] "a somewhat subdued patch" [...] between the obvious hit singles, [...] "Photograph" [...] and [...] "You're Sixteen", while Alan Betrock of Phonograph Record dismissed it as [...] "muzak without definition". Writing in Rolling Stone, Ben Gerson identified [...] "Sunshine Life for Me" [...] as a [...] "modal banjo tune" [...] that [...] "never manages to transcend its idiom, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> fulfil it".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{painting}} was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put {{a single one of}} them into the hands of a Demon, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." [...] The Times said, [...] "We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but {{as far as we can}} comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly", and criticised Etty for a [...] "slovenly manner" [...] and for [...] "abusing his rich gifts, and [...] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that [...] "The work is one of extraordinary power" [...] and that [...] "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{point to make}} here {{is that while the}} Packer affair {{had a lot to do}} with the writing of the book, the writer isn’t interested about the merits or demerits of Packer’s intentions. While he starts the introduction of the book with “This book owes something to Mr. Kerry Packer, without whom it might not have been written”, he also mentions in the same page “I do not wish to argue here the rights and wrongs of the Packer affair, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> recount its already wearisome history.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the Delta, {{however, the}} French had <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> show for their efforts. [...] Their first major {{victory against the}} insurgents, at Ba Dinh in January 1887, owed more to the folly of the Vietnamese {{commander}} Dinh Cong Trang, who deliberately challenged the French to a set-piece battle near the Annam-Tonkin border, than to the skill of the French high command. [...] The Vietnamese defeat at Ba Dinh was {{a disaster for the}} Can Vuong movement in Annam, and cost the lives of many Vietnamese insurgents, but it did little to lessen the problems that the French faced in Tonkin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wavelength}} of sound at 10kHz is 1.4" [...] (3.5cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4" [...] (6mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even {{up to the}} highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the [...] "purest" [...] microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.|$|E
2500|$|While not to {{say that}} Scottish victory was imminently on the horizon, the early winter and spring of 1338 were a turning point for the Scottish campaign. Murray in {{particular}} was ruthless, and while suffering his own defeats left such destruction in his wake that thousands of Scottish civilians were left without food to sustain themselves, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> fuel Balliol's cause. However, it was his dying blow.

2500|$|Bryan Fischer, former Director of Issues Analysis, has {{described}} Muslims as [...] "Parasites Who Must Convert or Die" [...] {{and stated that}} the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post “The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So {{the purpose of the}} First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to “approve, support, (or) accept” any “religion” other than Christianity." [...] Fischer has suggested Jews and Muslims are not included in religious freedom protections in the US, saying: “I have contended for years that the First Amendment, as given by the Founders, provides religious liberty protections for Christianity only.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} case, Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller {{was not required}} to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm {{the time of the}} tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet's decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr. wrote: [...] "No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> indict or not indict, without the reporters' evidence".|$|E
