500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} {{attracted the}} attention of the naval high command, as there had been a verified Japanese submarine attack against Fort Stevens about 50 miles further north in June 1942 and there had been an invasion scare in southern California earlier in 1942. Hubbard claimed to have [...] "definitely sunk, beyond doubt" [...] one submarine and critically damaged another. His view was not shared by his superiors. After reviewing the action reports and interviewing Hubbard and the other commanders present, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher noted: [...] "An analysis of all reports convinces <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The commanding officers of all ships except the PC-815 state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area." [...] Fletcher also noted that there was a [...] "known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped." [...] The clear implication was that Hubbard had been targeting the deposit all along.|$|E

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{member of}} the jury, Ann Redington, who broke down and cried as the verdict was being read, also told Chris Matthews, in a March 7, 2007, {{appearance}} on Hardball, that she hoped Libby would eventually be pardoned by President Bush; she told Matthews that she believed Libby [...] "got caught in a difficult situation where he {{got caught in the}} initial lie, and it just snowballed" [...] and added: [...] "It kind of bothers <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> this whole big crime being investigated and he {{got caught up in the}} investigation as opposed to in the actual crime that was supposedly committed." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 35 years, Barry Jones, who was {{a member}} of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment {{publicly}} on Ryan's hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards' book, The Hanged Man. Mr Jones says he remains [...] "unsure" [...] of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. [...] "It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> probably a reasonable doubt in the case," [...] he said. Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan's hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the government's unwillingness to grant {{immediate}} citizenship to all Indians reflected prevailing views among many {{politicians and the}} American public that Indians were not worthy of citizenship and should therefore not be entrusted with the responsibilities accorded citizens. Reformers chose wardship as the problem and fought for US citizenship for full participation in American life. Arthur C. Parker, {{a founding member of}} the Society of American Indians, characterized the anti-Indian tenor among politicians noting, [...] "one senator wrote <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a great deal of prejudice in considering Indian matters and reluctance to take them on." [...] In 1906, Congress passed the Burke Act, an amendment to the Dawes Act, which gave the U.S. Secretary of the Interior the ability to grant fee-simple titles to any land allottee [...] "competent and capable of managing his or her affairs." [...] The intent of the Act was to accelerate Indian assimilation and citizenship, and stipulated that every Indian who received a fee-simple title immediately became a citizen of the United States. However, the Act delayed citizenship for most Indians until the end of a 25-year trust period, citing as the primary reason Indians' unpreparedness for citizenship. McKenzie criticized the legislation for postponing citizenship of the majority of Indians for another generation, and argued that citizenship for the Indian meant opening the door of hope and self-responsibility.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Figures, a black Assistant U.S. Attorney, {{testified that}} Sessions {{said he thought}} the Ku Klux Klan was [...] "OK until I found out they smoked pot". Sessions later said that the comment was not serious, but did {{apologize}} for it, saying that he considered the Klan to be [...] "a force for hatred and bigotry". Barry Kowalski, a prosecutor in the civil rights division, also heard the remark and testified that prosecutors working such a gruesome case sometimes [...] "resort to operating room humor and that is what I considered it to be". Another DOJ lawyer, Albert Glenn, said, [...] "It never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any seriousness to it." [...] Figures testified that on one occasion, when the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions [...] "had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, 'I wish I could decline on all of them, by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. Kowalski, however, testified that he believed [...] " [...] was eager to see that justice was done in the area of criminal civil rights prosecutions." ...|$|E
