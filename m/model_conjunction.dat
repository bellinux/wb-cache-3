40|$|In {{fuzzy set}} theory, {{triangular}} norms and conorms {{are used to}} <b>model</b> <b>conjunction</b> and disjunction, respectively. An important class of triangular norms and conorms is the class of continuous Archimedean nilpotent triangular norms and conorms. It {{has been shown that}} for such t-norms T there exists a bijection phi on [0, 1] such that T is the phi-transform of the Lukasiewicz t-norm. From this class of t-norms an important class of fuzzy implicators can be generated: the class of Lukasiewicz implicators. In this paper we introduce the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy t-norm and t-conorm, and investigate under which conditions a similar representation theorem can be obtained. We also establish a representation theorem for intuitionistic fuzzy Lukasiewicz implicators...|$|E

We propose to improve the effectiveness of the decomposition algorithm by providing classification awareness. Attentional guidance does not depend solely on local visual features, but must also include the effects of interactions among features. The idea is to group together filters that will be responsible to extract similar features. It is well known that knowledge about which features define the target improves searc...|$|E

A definitive version was subsequently published in Journal of Hydrology Vol. 388 (2010), DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jhydrol. 2010. 05. 028 A flash flood routing model with artificial neural networks predictions was developed for stage profiles forecasting. The artificial neural network models were used to predict the 1 - 3 h lead time river stages at gauge stations along a river. The predictions were taken as interior boundaries in the flash flood routing model for the forecast of longitudinal stage profiles, including the un-gauged sites of a whole river. The flash flood routing model was based on the dynamic wave equations with discretization processes of the four-point finite difference method. Five typhoon events were applied to calibrate the rainfall-stage model and the other three events were simulated to verify the model's capability. The results revealed that the flash flood river routing <b>model</b> <b>conjunction</b> with artificial neural networks can provide accurate river stages for flood forecasting.

40|$|The {{superior}} temporal sulcus (STS) and gyrus (STG) {{are commonly}} identified to be functionally relevant for multisensory integration of audiovisual (AV) stimuli. However, most neuroimaging studies on AV integration used stimuli of short duration in explicit evaluative tasks. Importantly though, {{many of our}} AV experiences are of a long duration and ambiguous. It is unclear if the enhanced activity in audio, visual, and AV brain areas would also be synchronised over time across subjects when {{they are exposed to}} such multisensory stimuli. We used intersubject correlation to investigate which brain areas are synchronised across novices for uni- and multisensory versions of a 6 -min 26 -s recording of an unfamiliar, unedited Indian dance recording (Bharatanatyam). In Bharatanatyam, music and dance are choreographed together in a highly intermodal-dependent manner. Activity in the middle and posterior STG was significantly correlated between subjects and showed also significant enhancement for AV integration when the functional magnetic resonance signals were contrasted against each other using a general linear <b>model</b> <b>conjunction</b> analysis. These results extend previous studies by showing an intermediate step of synchronisation for novices: while there was a consensus across subjects' brain activity in areas relevant for unisensory processing and AV integration of related audio and visual stimuli, we found no evidence for synchronisation of higher level cognitive processes, suggesting these were idiosyncratic...|$|E
