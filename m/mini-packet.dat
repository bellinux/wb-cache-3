40|$|While the Cassini {{spacecraft}} telemetry design {{had taken}} on the new approach of 'packetized telemetry', the AACS (Attitude and Articulation Subsystem) had further extended into the design of 'mini-packets' in its telemetry system. Such telemetry packet and <b>mini-packet</b> design produced the AACS Telemetry Dictionary; iterations of the latter in turn provided changes to the former. The ultimate goals were to achieve maximum telemetry packing density, optimize the 'freshness' of more time-critical data, and to effect flexibility, i. e., multiple AACS data collection schemes, without needing to change the overall spacecraft telemetry mode. This paper describes such a systematic process and methodology, evidenced by various design products related to, or as part of, the AACS Telemetry Dictionary...|$|E
40|$|The Cambridge Fast Ring (CFR) {{local area}} network {{operates}} at 75 Mbit/s and forms the basis for much of our high-speed protocol research. The CFR <b>mini-packet</b> contains 16 bit source and destination addresses and 256 bits of data. Our current block assembly/disassembly and data-link protocol is UDL (Unison Data Link). This carries higher level protocols such as Unity RPC, local protocols for file transfer, bootstrapping etc and TCP/IP. UDL is also being used experimentally for voice, realtime video and high-speed packet switching. Unison, an Alvey collaborative project, together with Olivetti Research, has developed a CFR/UDL/RPC based protocol suite for wide-area site interconnection. This uses 2 Mbit ISDN links and an architecture for address translation at domain boundaries {{in the style of}} ATM. Without this, the sixteen bit, physical layer route identifiers would present a limitation. Protocol performance over local and wide area conditions is presented. Ongoing research is assessing U [...] ...|$|E
25|$|There {{were around}} 1088 {{channels}} (in 67 <b>mini-packets)</b> {{assembled in the}} Cassini Telemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity <b>mini-packets,</b> 6 <b>mini-packets</b> contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 <b>mini-packets.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{telemetry}} {{was developed}} from ground up, {{due to the}} spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions. Therefore, Cassini was the first spacecraft to adopt <b>mini-packets</b> to reduce {{the complexity of the}} Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process {{led to the creation of}} a Telemetry Manager for the mission.|$|R
