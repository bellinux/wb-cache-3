Pylkkänen's argument, about low applicatives and high applicatives, states {{that on a}} syntax tree level, low applicatives have an applicative morpheme below the verb in a sentence and involve an additional v, or pronoun maker. In looking at the German examples, (40) is deemed ungrammatical due to the possessor-raising and <b>misplacement</b> of the pronoun maker, or lack of a bound variable interpretation.

25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or <b>misplacement</b> once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E

40|$|Background: Electrocardiography is a {{very useful}} {{diagnostic}} tool. However, errors in placement of ECG leads can create artifacts, mimic pathologies, and hinder proper ECG interpretation. This is the second of a two-part series discussing how to recognize and avoid these errors. Methods: 12 -lead ECGs were recorded in a single male healthy subject in his mid 20 s. Various precordial lead <b>misplacements</b> were compared to ECG recordings from correct lead placement. Results: Precordial <b>misplacements</b> caused classical changes in ECG patterns. Techniques of differentiating these ECG patterns from true pathological findings were described. Conclusion: As in Part I of this series, recognition and interpretation of common ECG placement errors is critical in providing optimal patient care...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{limitations of}} the one-dimensional elastic beam model to detect grounding line and thickness of an ice shelf from a differential interferogram. Spatial limitations due to grounding line curvature and variable ice thickness are analyzed by comparison with two-dimensional plate flexure. Temporal limitations from the tide-dependent shift of the grounding line are analyzed by superpositions of four tidal flexure profiles representing differential interferograms. (i) At scales greater one ice thickness seaward protrusions of the grounding line are well represented by the elastic beam model, while landward embayments of the same scale produce significant <b>misplacements</b> > 10 per cent of the ice thickness. (ii) For reasonable spatial variations of shelf thickness the elastic beam model gives reliable estimates of grounding line position and unfractured mean ice thickness near the grounding line. (iii) For about 20 per cent of superpositions of four tidal flexure profiles the resulting grounding line <b>misplacements</b> exceed the physical tidal shift of the grounding line by factors > 2. For differential tide levels 2 km. Examples of real interferometric profiles from West Antarctic ice shelves corroborate our results...|$|R

40|$|Uniaxial Hand-Held Dynamometer (HHD) is a {{low-cost}} device widely adopted in clinical practice to measure muscle force. HHD measurements depend on operator’s ability and joint movements. The {{aim of the}} work is to validate the use of a commercial HHD in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion ankle strength measurements quantifying the effects of HHD <b>misplacements</b> and unwanted foot’s movements on the measurements. We used an optoelectronic system and a multicomponent load cell to quantify the sources of error in the manual assessment of the ankle strength due to both the operator’s ability to hold still the HHD and the transversal components of the exerted force that are usually neglected in clinical routine. Results showed that foot’s movements and angular <b>misplacements</b> of HHD on sagittal and horizontal planes were relevant sources of inaccuracy on the strength assessment. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion force measurements presented an inaccuracy less than 2 % and higher than 10 %, respectively. In conclusion, the manual use of a uniaxial HHD is not recommended for the assessment of ankle plantarflexion strength; on the contrary, it can be allowed asking the operator to pay strong attention to the HHD positioning in ankle dorsiflexion strength measurements...|$|R
