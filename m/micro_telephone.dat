50|$|The Tele. 162 Handset <b>Micro</b> <b>Telephone,</b> was {{the first}} UK phone to {{incorporate}} the transmitter and receiver into a single unit, 'The Handset'. It {{was designed as a}} very lightweight domestic phone, which could be carried around whilst in use, by hooking the fingers under the switch-hook cradle. For this purpose it could be ordered with an extra long instrument cord at additional cost. It was even with a blanking plate instead of the dial. Like the Tele. 150, it required a bellset 25 to complete its electrical circuitry and to provide bells. This could be either screwed directly under the telephone or mounted separately in another location.|$|E
50|$|The 300 series {{equipment}} {{was introduced in}} 1937. The Tele. 332 ASTIC, Handset <b>Micro</b> <b>Telephone</b> was the standard telephone instrument issued by the GPO from 1937 until 1959, although 242Ls continued to be supplied for pay-on-answer kiosks. Essentially it was a redesign of the 232/bellset 26 combo. The term ASTIC indicates {{the use of an}} anti-sidetone induction coil, to permit only a small, controlled amount of speech signal back to the talker's ear to provide necessary sidetone for a natural communication experience. It continued in production until the mid-1960s. This was usually only available in black although ivory, red and, the especially rare, green were also produced. Although 332 is the generic for this model, by dint of superior numbers, there were four other models in the range. The glossy, sharp styled 332 gestated from the much poorer quality 330. Though similar, the quality and finish of the 330s moulding was poor, by comparison. Then there were the button phones. A 332 with the facility for one button is a 312, two buttons a 328 and three buttons a 314. For this reason, in the photos below the instrument on the left is, strictly speaking, a 314 and the one on the right a 312, despite the fact that their full potential is not being utilised.The Tele. 332L shown on the left is a bedside extension from an Extension Plan 1A. Note the addition of the BELL ON - BELL OFF push buttons, forward of the switchook cradle. The centre button position is filled with a blanking stud and only a 2 way label is installed. The instrument on the right is a Tele 312, but has its single button hole fitted with a blanking stud. The label screws are sitting redundant in their holes.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{intensive}} {{business service}} firms (KIBS) {{are an important}} element of modern economies and thus attracting increasing interest in scientific research. In the existing literature it is argued that due to the important role of knowledge, innovation and user-producer interaction in the KIBS sector, functional and regional integration are particularly decisive for the firms 2 ̆ 019 post-entry development. Nevertheless, few existing studies are dealing with questions of entrepreneurship in the KIBS sector using micro firm data. This contribution gives an empirical analysis of the determinants of post-entry performance of KIBS in three German metropolitan regions. Due to the lack of suitable firm <b>micro</b> data, <b>telephone</b> interviews with 547 firm founders have been conducted. By applying multivariate estimation methods it can be shown that functional linkages to knowledge providers, customers and co-operation partners indeed matter for the performance of young KIBS. Regarding regional integration, however, especially a high diversification of spatial reach is proved to be crucial.
