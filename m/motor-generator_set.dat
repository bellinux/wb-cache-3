25|$|Because {{of their}} shorter {{wheelbase}} {{and the smaller}} <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> designed for one trailer only, 36/42 stock units were kept for the Johnsonville line as much as possible. Similarly, the three-car sets of 1946 stock were kept for use on the Paekakariki, Melling and Upper Hutt services due to their greater passenger-carrying capacity and reduced brake capacity on steep lines.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set,</b> or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not {{strictly}} a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] {{locomotives}} {{were built}} at Schenectady, New York, with car bodies manufactured by American Locomotive Company and electrical components supplied by General Electric. They used <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> {{to rectify the}} alternating current line voltage into direct current for their traction motors.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{conversion}} equipment usually consisted {{of one or}} more <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> containing three-phase synchronous AC motors and single-phase AC generators, mechanically coupled to a common shaft. Rotary converters were also used, especially where the desired output was DC current from an AC source.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the rotary converter over the discrete <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|E

50|$|The {{main station}} houses four <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets,</b> four 1250 {{kilowatt}} transformers, three 375 kilowatt transformers, and three 75 kilowatt transformers. The east {{wing of the}} station contained a 550-volt, 275-cell storage battery. All of this electrical equipment was removed around 1939, when the owning railroad sold the property.|$|R
2500|$|HVDC {{converters}} {{can take}} several different forms. Early HVDC systems, built until the 1930s, were effectively rotary converters and used electromechanical conversion with <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> connected in {{series on the}} DC side and in parallel on the AC side. [...] However, all HVDC systems built since the 1940s have used electronic (static) converters.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century, DC-to-AC power {{conversion}} was accomplished using rotary converters or <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> (M-G sets). In the early twentieth century, vacuum tubes and gas filled tubes began to be used as switches in inverter circuits. The most widely used type of tube was the thyratron.|$|R
50|$|A {{rotary phase}} {{converter}} (RPC) may be {{built as a}} <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set.</b> These completely isolate the load from the single-phase supply and produce balanced three-phase output. However, due to weight, cost, and efficiency concerns, most RPCs are not built this way.|$|E
5000|$|The EMD SW1200MG was a 4-axle {{electric}} locomotive built by General Motors Diesel between 1963 and 1971. This locomotive was the electric {{version of the}} diesel powered SW1200, with the prime mover replaced by a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set,</b> hence the MG suffix in the model number.|$|E
50|$|Direct current may be {{obtained}} from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier, which contains electronic elements (usually) or electromechanical elements (historically) that allow current to flow only in one direction. Direct current may be converted into alternating current with an inverter or a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
50|$|Motor-generators {{can convert}} between any {{combination}} of DC and AC voltage and phase standards. Large <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller units were used to convert battery power (6, 12 or 24 V DC) to a high DC voltage, which was required to operate vacuum tube (thermionic valve) equipment.|$|R
50|$|Production of cars {{stopped in}} 1940 but engine {{production}} for <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> continued alongside aircraft components {{and other military}} hardware. The engine was (besides {{being used as a}} generator set) also used in the Jowett engine powered Fire Pump. The company was bought by property developer Charles Clore in 1945 and he sold it in 1947 to the bankers Lazard Brothers.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{bank was}} placed {{apart from the}} power-house and protected by a lightning arrester and fuses. Rated at 2,000 kV&middot;A, these transformers stepped the voltage up to 26,400 volts for transmission to Island Falls. There, a sub-station stepped the current down to 600 volts for two <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> which supplied current for the electric locomotives used in hauling earth, concrete and other construction materials.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter {{wheelbase}} {{and the smaller}} <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> designed for one trailer only, 36/42 stock units were kept for the Johnsonville line as much as possible.

50|$|Instead {{of using}} {{miniature}} rotating machines, accurately calibrated phase-shifting transformers were built to simulate electrical machines. These were all energized {{by the same}} source (at local power frequency or from a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set)</b> and so inherently maintained synchronism. The phase angle and terminal voltage of each simulated generator could be set using rotary scales on each phase-shifting transformer unit. Using the per-unit system allowed values to be conveniently interpreted without additional calculation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set,</b> {{mainly of}} {{historical}} interest, {{consists of an}} electric motor and generator coupled together. A dynamotor combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>motor-generator</b> (an M-G <b>set)</b> is {{a device}} for {{converting}} electrical power to another form. <b>Motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> {{are used to}} convert frequency, voltage, or phase of power. They may {{also be used to}} isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor-generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor-generators (such as the one shown in the picture) were used to convert battery power to higher DC voltages. These motor-generators {{should not be confused with}} [...] "motor generator", which is a term occasionally used to describe a portable generator powered by an internal combustion engine.|$|R
2500|$|Some DC {{locomotives}} used <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> as [...] "stepdown transformers" [...] {{to produce}} more convenient voltages for auxiliary loads such as lighting, fans and compressors but they are inefficient, noisy and unreliable. Solid-state converters have replaced them. State-of-the-art locomotives (diesel-electric as well as electric) have even replaced the traditional universal-type traction motor with a three-phase AC induction motor driven by a special-purpose AC inverter, a variable frequency drive.|$|R
50|$|Block 2, {{in service}} since 1988, has a nominal {{electrical}} power of 1400 megawatts. The generator produces 50 Hz three-phase {{alternating current with}} a voltage of 27,000 V and a current of 35,000 amperes. Unlike Unit 1, no dedicated traction current generation takes place, {{but some of the}} power produced is converted at the traction current substation. This is transmitted through the 380 kV generator transformer block of the II and the 380 kV-machine transformer of the <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} size of the model components, the network {{analyzer}} often was energized at a higher frequency than the 50 Hz or 60 Hz utility frequency. The operating frequency was chosen to be high enough to allow high-quality inductors and capacitors to be made, and to be compatible with the available indicating instruments, but not so high that stray capacitance would affect results. Many systems used either 440 Hz, or 480 Hz, provided by a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set,</b> to reduce size of model components. Some systems used 10 kHz, using capacitors and inductors similar to those used in radio electronics.|$|E
50|$|While a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> may {{consist of}} {{distinct}} motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo-motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore {{share the same}} outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.|$|E
50|$|Each {{motor car}} is fitted with two series DC motors, {{one on each}} of the two bogies and are {{designed}} to operate from the 630 volt traction supply. Each motor has an output of approximately 250 horsepower. The controllers and switchgear are operated from a 50 volt auxiliary supply provided by a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set.</b> This system allows the master controller {{at one end of the}} train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by Sprague for the Elevated railway in Chicago, Illinois some 46 years earlier. This same supply is also used to power the train lighting as well as some other auxiliary circuits.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility of eliminating the 400 -Hz <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> {{used to provide}} power to the high-voltage power supplies of the 20 -kW transmitters {{and replace them with}} a 60 -Hz high-voltage power supply was investigated. The efficiency of a power supply that runs from the 60 -Hz line directly would pay for itself in about seven years and could be designed so that the transmitter would meet all the incidental phase and amplitude modulation specifications...|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the {{advantages}} of DC long-distance transmission were starting to become evident and several commercial power transmission systems were put into operation. The most successful of these used the system invented by René Thury and {{were based on the}} principle of connecting several <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> in series on the DC side. [...] The best-known example was the 200km, Lyon–Moutiers DC transmission scheme in France, which operated commercially from 1906 to 1936 transmitting power from the Moutiers hydroelectric plant to the city of Lyon.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} true 180s {{in the initial}} lineup, codenamed P1, P2, P3. P2 and P3 were larger {{water-cooled}} designs. The P2 was designed in Mississauga, Ontario, by the same team that later designed the smaller P1, and the P3 was designed in Arden Hills, Minnesota. The P1 was a novel air-cooled, 60-board cabinet designed by a group in Mississauga; the P1 ran on 60 Hz current (no <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> needed). A fourth high-end 180 model 990 (codenamed THETA) was also under development in Arden Hills.|$|R
50|$|Converting DC {{power from}} one voltage to another {{required}} a large spinning rotary converter or <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set,</b> which was difficult, expensive, inefficient, and required maintenance, whereas with AC the {{voltage can be}} changed with simple and efficient transformers that have no moving parts and require very little maintenance. This {{was the key to}} the success of the AC system. Modern transmission grids regularly use AC voltages up to 765,000 volts. Power electronic devices such as the mercury-arc valve and thyristor made high-voltage direct current transmission practical by improving the reliability and efficiency of conversion between alternating and direct current, but such technology only became possible on an industrial scale starting in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{body of the}} {{locomotive}} was divided into a high tension chamber and a low tension auxiliary machine and equipment compartment with a side corridor along {{the right side of}} {{the locomotive}} when looking towards Cab 1. In the high tension chamber, 43 contactors were arranged along one side with the <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> in the middle of the chamber. The motor-generator was a four-machine unit comprising a high tension motor, two DC exciters, one for each motor, and the 110 V generator for the auxiliary equipment. The machines were flexibly coupled with a blower fan directly coupled at each end of the four-unit set, each fan supplying air to two of the main motors.|$|E
50|$|Two were {{supplied}} in 1926 and 3 in 1928. Each Z-1 locomotive had two semi-permanently coupled 1-D-1 box-cab units; {{the pair}} weighed more than 371 tons with an hourly rating of 4330 hp and a {{continuous tractive effort}} of 88,500 lbs per unit (177,000 lb per pair) and a maximum starting effort of 189,000 lb. The locos had a <b>motor-generator</b> <b>set</b> with a synchronous AC motor and DC generator which supplied the Westinghouse 356-A traction motors geared to each driving axle. They were equipped for multiple-unit control and regenerative breaking. A pair of Z-1s with four units could move a 2900-ton train over the 2.2% maximum gradient of the new Cascade line.|$|E
50|$|<b>Motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} by semiconductor devices for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets were in elevators. Since accurate speed control of the hoisting machine was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drives and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery.|$|R
40|$|The {{voltage source}} used for testing {{electrical}} equipment has to achieve special requirements, which are {{noted in the}} international standards. Still today the test voltages for routine- and type tests of utilities for the power en-gineering are generated by <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets.</b> Attempting to replace the m. -g. sets with static fre-quency converters, two major problems occur in im-plementing this technology for testing applications: the insufficient quality of the output voltage and the high background noise for partial discharge (pd) measure-ments. This paper deals with {{the reasons for the}} high interference level and the elimination of disturbing emission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mining {{industry}} is changing rapidly due to mergers, acquisitions and fluctuating market pricing. Successful mining operation in today's market for coal, minerals, ores, and aggregates demands electrical apparatus that perform every time with maximum efficiency and with consideration for personnel safety. DC motors and <b>motor-generator</b> <b>sets</b> have remained {{the standard for}} mining dragline operation since their adoption in the early 20 th century. Despite advances, DC technology continues to present significant challenges in productivity, efficiency, safety, and repair. FLANDERS’ completion of the first North American DC to AC Dragline Upgrade successfully eliminates the challenges of DC technology and brings dragline operation into the 21 st century...|$|R
