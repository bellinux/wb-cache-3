50|$|Scientific {{evidence}} of this is provided {{through the use of}} technologies such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence rapid-monitoring systems. These systems indicate the presence of organic matter that may host harmful microorganisms on a variety of surfaces. In addition to detecting contaminants, ATP systems also provide “proof of service” that an area has been effectively and thoroughly cleaned. According to scientific studies using ATP technology, spray-and-vac systems have been proven to remove more contaminants and disease-causing germs and bacteria on surfaces when compared to conventional <b>mop,</b> <b>bucket,</b> and cloth style cleaning. Additionally, tests show that spray-and-vac systems do not spread contaminants from surface to surface, as can happen when using conventional cleaning methods.|$|E

Estleman wrote of Bruce: [...] "If a <b>mop</b> <b>bucket</b> appeared in a scene, his foot would be inside it, and if by some sardonic twist of fate and the whim of director Roy William Neill he managed to stumble upon an important clue, he could be depended upon to blow his nose on it and throw it away."

5000|$|The {{building}} {{that is now}} The Old Wellington Inn was built in 1552 next to Manchester's market square. In 1554, it was purchased by the Byrom family and became part residence and part drapers shop. The writer John Byrom was born there in 1692. The premises were licensed in 1862 and became the Vintners Arms, then the Kenyon Vaults and later The Old Wellington Inn. The building was extended in the 18th century to house John Shaw's Punch House which, as the name suggests, was licensed {{for the sale of}} strong alcoholic punch and became a meeting place for High Tories and possibly Jacobites. The customers usually assembled around 6 o'clock and, according to rule, called for [...] "sixpennyworth of punch". John Shaw was a stickler for discipline, having formerly been a trooper and fought in the wars of Queen Anne's reign, and the rules of the establishment were strictly enforced. Eight o'clock was the hour fixed by law for closing and, as soon as the clock struck eight, Shaw would present himself before his guests and proclaim in a loud voice [...] "Eight o'clock gentlemen, eight o'clock!" [...] accompanying the announcement with the suggestive cracking of a horsewhip. This would normally soon clear the house but, if the cracking of the whip failed, his maid, Molly Owen, was ordered to use the contents of her <b>mop</b> <b>bucket</b> to [...] "expedite the movement of the loiterer". When one Colonel Stanley was elected Member of Parliament for the county he took his friends to Shaw's, and when [...] "Eight o'clock" [...] was announced as usual, said that he hoped Mr Shaw would not press the matter on this special occasion. Shaw replied [...] "Colonel Stanley, you are a lawmaker and should not be a lawbreaker, and if you and your friends do not leave the room in five minutes you will find your shoes full of water!" [...] Within that time Molly came in with her <b>mop</b> <b>bucket</b> and the Colonel and his friends were required to beat a hasty retreat. Shaw was master of the punch house for 58 years until he died in 1796 at the age of 83. After Shaw's death the punch house was kept by Peter Fearnhead, with the assistance of Molly under the same rules, until it was sold about twelve years later. The new landlord demolished part of the building and converted the rest into The King's Head Tavern in 1809. It later became known as Sinclair's, until oysters were introduced to the menu in 1845 and it became Sinclair's Oyster Bar, the name it retains to this day.|$|E

After the discovery of contaminated groundwater in 1981, the Army extended Grand Island city water lines to rural subdivisions (that as of 2014 {{are part of the}} Capital Heights and Le Heights areas) in 1985, because well water may have exposed residents to contaminated water. In 1987, the Army burned about 40,000 tons of explosives-contaminated soil. In 1993, city water lines in northwest and north central Grand Island were extended.

Knowing he has lost all support, he commits himself to ruining their wagers by defeating Dolor in the newly improvised final round. Dolor takes an early lead with his exceptionally quick hand blocks and strikes, as well as exacerbating the problems with Boyka's weak knee by using a submission hold on it. Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is {{kicked out of the}} ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the <b>mop</b> and <b>bucket</b> used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count.

5000|$|Born in Memphis, Cal Alley {{was the son}} of James Pinckney Alley, {{creator of}} the {{syndicated}} cartoon panel, Hambone's Meditations, and the first editorial cartoonist at The Commercial Appeal in 1916.

Hambone's Meditations ran {{on the front page of}} The Commercial Appeal. When the elder Alley died April 16, 1934, Cal Alley and his brother James took over Hambone's Meditations. Pressure from Civil Rights groups brought the long-run cartoon series to an end in 1968. Tom Hunley told a WPA interviewer how he met J. P. Alley: Mr. J.P. really did stay here in Greenwood once.
