30|$|Moreover, Definition  4.3 {{gives the}} {{expression}} of <b>mild</b> solutions <b>to</b> Eq. (1). It is worth emphasizing that the methods used in this paper can also be applied to study the weighted piecewise pseudo almost automorphic <b>mild</b> solutions <b>to</b> other abstract impulsive ∇-dynamic equations and Δ-dynamic equations.

5|$|As {{with most}} {{sympathomimetic}} stimulants {{there appear to}} be significant side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> severe hangover after the drug effect wears off, however, some manufacturers in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain 5-HTP and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
50|$|Fatty {{acid esters}} of isethionic acid (such as sodium lauroyl isethionate and sodium cocoyl isethionate) {{are used as}} {{biodegradable}} anionic surfactants. These materials are much <b>milder</b> <b>to</b> skin that other sulphate based surfactants (i.e. sodium lauryl sulfate) making them popular for use in make-up, shampoos and ‘Dove type’ soap bars.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus {{belongs to}} the section Deliciosi of the genus Lactarius. According to {{molecular}} phylogenetics studies, this section forms a definite phylogenetic group within the milk cap relatives. Deliciosi species mainly have an orange or reddish-coloured latex and taste <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> slightly bitter. They are strict mycorrhizal associates of conifers.

5|$|Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no {{distinctive}} {{smell and}} taste <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> slightly bitter. Opinions are divided as to its edibility, however, as some authors regard the mushroom as inedible, while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate acne.|$|E

5|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS or DNS), {{also known}} as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused {{by the presence of}} all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.|$|E
5|$|PLC {{also offers}} a unique special {{education}} unit catering to students with <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate intellectual disabilities. The transition programme was developed in 1992 {{in response to a}} decision by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 18 are provided with an individual curriculum incorporating mainstream classes where possible.|$|E
5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
50|$|Mild ales are {{generally}} based on mild malt or pale malt. Most milds contain, in addition, {{a quantity of}} crystal malt; dark milds, meanwhile, make use of chocolate malt, black malt or dark brewing sugars. <b>Milds</b> tend <b>to</b> be lightly hopped compared to pale ale and are usually low in alcohol; strong <b>mild</b> ales used <b>to</b> reach six or seven per cent abv, but very few such beers are still brewed. Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby <b>Mild,</b> brewed <b>to</b> a pre-World War I recipe, is a rare example of a strong Mild (6.0% ABV).|$|R

5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> severe disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once a {{child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
30|$|Four {{independent}} radiologists blinded {{to clinical}} information analyzed the MDCT images and classified the site (the arytenoid region, the subglottic region or the trachea to 2  cm below the carina) {{and severity of}} injuries (from <b>mildest</b> <b>to</b> most severe: mucosal thickening, cartilage thickening or deep ulceration) and evaluated whether tracheal stenosis was present. The group reached a consensus on discrepant readings.|$|R
