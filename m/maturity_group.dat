The core collection, which includes selected lines in extra early, early, medium and late maturity groups was evaluated for 18 qualitative and 16 quantitative characters during the 2004 rainy season, {{to assess the}} phenotypic diversity and determine {{the relative importance of}} different characters in evaluating pigeonpea germplasm accessions. The four maturity groups differed significantly for all characters under study. The medium <b>maturity</b> <b>group</b> showed significantly higher mean number of primary, secondary and tertiary branches, number of racemes, pod bearing length, pods per plant, shelling percent and plot seed yield. Late <b>maturity</b> <b>group</b> showed significantly higher mean for leaf size, plant height, pod length, seeds per pod and 100 -seed weight, indicating this group as a good source of vegetable pigeonpea. Significant positive correlations were found between number of secondary branches and pods per plant in extra early group (r = 0. 756), late <b>maturity</b> <b>group</b> (r = 0. 776) and entire core (r = 0. 728) and between number of racemes and pods per plant in all maturity groups and entire core. Principal coordinate and principal component analysis showed that seven qualitative and nine quantitative traits were important in explaining multivariate polymorphism.

40|$|A {{series of}} half-diallel crosses {{involving}} early, medium and late maturity desi and kabuli type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes with stable resistance to Helicoverpa pod borer, {{along with the}} parents, were evaluated at two locations in India to understand the inheritance of pod borer resistance and grain yield. Inheritance of resistance to pod borer and grain yield was different in desi and kabuli types. In desi type chickpea, the additive component of genetic variance was important in early maturity and dominance component was predominant in medium <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> while in the late <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> additive as well as dominance components were equally important in the inheritance of pod borer resistance. Both dominant and recessive genes conferring pod borer resistance seemed equally frequent in the desi type parental lines of medium <b>maturity</b> <b>group.</b> However, dominant genes were in overall excess in the parents of early and late maturity groups. In the kabuli medium <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> parents appeared to be genetically similar, possibly due to dispersion of genes conferring pod borer resistance and susceptibility, while their F 1 s were significantly different for pod borer damage. The association of genes conferring pod borer resistance and susceptibility in the parents {{could be attributed to}} the similarity of parents as well as their F 1 s for pod borer damage in kabuli early and late maturity groups. Grain yield was predominantly under the control of dominant gene action irrespective of the maturity groups in desi chickpea. In all the maturity groups, dominant and recessive genes were in equal frequency among the desi parental lines. Dominant genes, which tend to increase or decrease grain yield are more or less present in equal frequency in parents of the early <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> while in medium and late maturity groups, they were comparatively in unequal frequency in desi type. Unlike in desi chickpea, differential patterns of genetic components were observed in kabuli chickpea. While the dominant genetic component was important in early and late <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> additive gene action was involved in the inheritance of grain yield in medium duration group in kabuli chickpea. The dominant and recessive genes controlling grain yield are asymmetrically distributed in early and medium maturity groups in kabuli chickpea. The implications of the inheritance pattern of pod borer resistance and grain yield are discussed in the context of strategies to enhance pod borer resistance and grain yield in desi and kabuli chickpea cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Soybean cultivars from <b>maturity</b> <b>groups</b> III-V {{were grown}} in Heterodera glycines-infested {{locations}} in northeastern and southeastern Kansas from 1991 through 1994. Yield performance and nematode reproduction were significantly (P < 0. 01) affected by host response to H. glycines and year, whereas effects of cultivars within host response categories and cultivar x year interactions were generally negligible. In northeastern Kansas, H. glycines-susceptible cultivars from <b>maturity</b> <b>groups</b> III-IV yielded 8 % less than resistant cultivars across years, whereas in southeastern Kansas, susceptible cultivars from <b>maturity</b> <b>groups</b> IV-V yielded 38 % less than resistant cultivars across years.

Heterodera glycines reproduction rates (final population density/initial population density) averaged 0. 7 and 1. 3 for resistant cultivars and 8. 7 and 15. 9 for susceptible cultivars in northeastern and southeastern locations, respectively.

40|$|Ossification {{score and}} animal age are both used as proxies for maturity-related {{collagen}} crosslinking and consequently decreases in beef tenderness. Ossification score is {{strongly influenced by}} the hormonal status of the animal and may therefore better reflect physiological maturity and consequently eating quality. As {{part of a broader}} cross-European study, local consumers scored 18 different muscle types cooked in three ways from 482 carcasses with ages ranging from 590 to 6135 days and ossification scores ranging from 110 to 590. The data were studied across three different maturity ranges; the complete range of maturities, a lesser range and a more mature range. The lesser <b>maturity</b> <b>group</b> consisted of carcasses having either an ossification score of 200 or less or an age of 987 days or less with the remainder in the greater <b>maturity</b> <b>group.</b> The three different maturity ranges were analysed separately with a linear mixed effects model. Across all the data, and for the greater <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> animal age had a greater magnitude of effect on eating quality than ossification score. This is likely due to a loss of sensitivity in mature carcasses where ossification approached and even reached the maximum value. In contrast, age had no relationship with eating quality for the lesser <b>maturity</b> <b>group,</b> leaving ossification score as the more appropriate measure. Therefore ossification score is more appropriate for most commercial beef carcasses, however it is inadequate for carcasses with greater maturity such as cull cows. Both measures may therefore be required in models to predict eating quality over populations with a wide range in maturity...|$|E
