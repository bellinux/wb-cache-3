5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number of <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, as <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} {{if there are}} differences between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural <b>and</b> urban areas on perception of women empowerment. The focus is on girls’ education and development in a post – colonial country. Semi structured, qualitative interviews were conducted in Babati district, Tanzania in February 2011. In order to obtain as much useful information and data as possible several research questions were focused on during the fieldwork. These were: What is the perception on empowerment of women, according to local <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural <b>and</b> urban Babati?, How does a gender gap in school affect development, according to local <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural <b>and</b> urban Babati?, Is the patriarchal heritage an obstacle for development and gender equality, according to local <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural <b>and</b> urban Babati?, Why are urban areas more equal than rural areas, according to local <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural <b>and</b> urban Babati? The conclusion is that people in rural and urban areas are very similar in their opinions’ of empowerment of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> education for girls.
