5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and <b>mudstone.</b> Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty <b>mudstone,</b> and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} <b>mudstone,</b> {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
40|$|At low temperatures, siliciclastic <b>mudstones</b> compact mechanically. Above 70 C, {{where the}} smectite-to-illite {{transformation}} dominates clay diagenesis, they also compact chemically, provided that excess pore water can escape. There are two prevailing conceptual {{models for the}} compaction of siliciclastic <b>mudstones</b> at higher temperatures, above ~ 100 C. One holds that precipitation of minerals during diagenesis cements the <b>mudstones</b> such that mechanical compaction no longer occurs even if the <b>mudstones</b> can drain freely. According to the other model, diagenetically altered <b>mudstones</b> continue to compact mechanically in response to increasing effective stress. We found that wireline-log and pressure data from Cretaceous <b>mudstones</b> at Haltenbanken are consistent with ongoing mechanical compaction accompanying chemical compaction up to at least 130 C. We suggest that mechanical compaction continues because grain contacts in siliciclastic <b>mudstones</b> following smectite-to-illite transformation are still mostly between clay grains...|$|R

The lower Mineral Wells formation of the Pennsylvanian Strawn group is a siliciclastic-dominated sequence of cyclically interbedded <b>mudstones,</b> sandstones. and carbonates that was deposited in fluvial, deltaic, interdeltaic, and inner shelf environments during late Desmoinesian and early Missourian time. This study examined outcrops of the formation in Palo Pinto and Parker counties in north-central Texas for the purpose of describing and interpreting its facies, depositional environments, and stratigraphy. Eight depositional facies were identified in the lower Mineral Wells formation on the basis of lithology. sedimentary structures, and fossil content. The open marine facies is fossiliferous and consists of gray, beige, green, and brown <b>mudstones,</b> black <b>mudstones</b> with phosphate nodules, and limestones. The prodelta facies is largely nonfossiliferous and consists of massive <b>mudstones,</b> massive silty <b>mudstones</b> with occasional siltstone lenses, and horizontal planar-and lenticular-laminated muddy siltstones. The transgressive shoreface facies consists of cross-laminated and ripple laminated fine-grained sandstones, highly bioturbated fine-grained sandstones, very thinly-bedded very fine-grained sandstones, and sandy and silty <b>mudstones.</b> The interdistributary bay facies consists of massive clayey <b>mudstones</b> with some rippled very fine-grained sandstones, highly bioturbated sandy <b>mudstones</b> and muddy sandstones, and stratified very fine-to medium-grained sandstones. The swampmarsh facies consists of gray platy <b>mudstones</b> containing abundant plant fragments, red <b>mudstones</b> containing iron concretions, and dark gray <b>mudstones</b> containing plant fragments and mudcracks. The distributary channel facies consists of trough and tabular cross-laminated sandstones, wavy-bedded sandstones, and wavy-laminated and lenticular <b>mudstones</b> and sandstones. The meanderbeft facies consists of trough cross-bedded fine-grained sandstones, massive conglomerates, rippled very fine-to fine-grained sandstones interlayered with muddy sandstones and sandy <b>mudstones,</b> and horizontal planar-and cross-laminated fine-to medium-grained sandstones interlayered with cross-bedded and massive conglomerates. Lastly, the aggrading channel facies consists of large scale trough cross-bedded, wavy-bedded, and rippled medium-grained quartz sandstones and cherty pebble conglomerates. The stratigraphy of the lower Mineral Wells formation is characterized by alternating progradational and transgressive sequences. Progradational sequences typically consist of vertical successions from open marine to prodelta to distributary channel or interdistributary bay. Transgressive sequences consist of transgressive shoreface deposits overlain by increasingly deeper marine facies...|$|R

40|$|The Nordenskjöld Formation (?Oxfordian-Berriasian age) {{is exposed}} {{on the east}} coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, where it {{consists}} of interbedded ash layers and biosiliceous <b>mudstones</b> which accumulated under anaerobic to dysaerobic bottom waters. The <b>mudstones</b> were deposited by pelagic settling and the ash layers by pelagic settling from suspension or as fallout from subaerial eruption columns. The lower part of the succession accumulated in a basinal setting under anaerobic bottom waters and is characterized by parallel bedding. <b>Mudstones</b> deposited in this setting preserve abundant zooplankton faecel pellets. Compaction of these pellets has given rise to a bedding parallel fissility. The upper part of the succession accumulated under dysaerobic bottom waters in a slope setting. The sequence is wavy bedded and contains abundant evidence of post-depositional sediment instability and resedimentation, much of which was caused by tectonic activity. Discrete slide masses are absent from the slope sequence and it appears that slope processes were dominated by creep.

40|$|This PhD {{research}} project aims {{to develop a}} better understanding of how physical seafloor reworking and macrofaunal bioturbation control the lithofacies variability of <b>mudstones</b> deposited under high-energy seafloor conditions. To address this aim, bioturbated and unbioturbated <b>mudstones</b> from two natural laboratories in Newfoundland, Canada and Baja California, Mexico were investigated. Sections of interest were logged at a cm-scale and organic and inorganic geochemical measurements were performed on bioturbated and unbioturbated <b>mudstones</b> within both successions. To improve the fidelity of paleoenvironmental reconstructions these geochemical measurements were combined with high-quality sedimentological and ichnological datasets at a range of length scales. Unbioturbated <b>mudstones</b> in the Early Ordovician Bell Island Group, Newfoundland, previously reported to have been deposited under anoxic conditions, instead, most likely originated as hyperpycnal flows and wave-enhanced sediment gravity flows. The proximity to a fluvial source and residence time of rock components in the near-surface zone are interpreted to be the primary control on the compositional heterogeneity of <b>mudstones</b> within this Ordovician mud-dominated shoreface paleoenvironment. Following this, high-energy seafloor conditions are a more realistic explanation for the high presence of unbioturbated <b>mudstones</b> in the heterolithic Bell Island Group. Additionally, the formation mechanism of shrinkage (‘synaeresis’) cracks, which are sedimentological prime indicators for salinity fluctuations in marginal-marine environments, has been re-evaluated. Sediment cracking is proposed to form as an exclusively intrastratal process, independent of fluctuations of pore water salinity. Spatial rheological inhomogeneities associated with microbial mat decay shortly after burial are proposed to produce intrastratal shrinkage cracks. The effect of bioturbation on the geochemical variability of <b>mudstones</b> has been investigated within <b>mudstones</b> and finegrained sandstones of the Rosario Formation, Mexico. The spatial distribution of organic carbon and redox-sensitive trace elements is controlled by the feeding activity of grainsize selective vermiform animals and associated in-vivo alteration of weatheringsusceptible minerals. The reactivity of organic carbon is proposed to be a critical variable controlling pathways of diagenesis in bioturbated <b>mudstones.</b> It is imperative that paleoenvironmental analyses consider the long-term effects of bioturbation and highenergy seafloor processes to fully understand the compositional variability of <b>mudstones</b> within a basin-wide context...|$|R

5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression).

Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded <b>mudstone</b> resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years.

The {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} {{rare earth elements}} (REEs) of red <b>mudstones</b> in {{the lower part of}} the fourth member of Shahejie Formation(S 4) in Dongying Depression shows that the red <b>mudstones</b> in the lower S 4 of Dongying Depression originate from multi-sources. Red <b>mudstones</b> can be classified into three major types based on the characteristics of their sedimentary structures, which are closely relevant to REEs of red <b>mudstones.</b> The three types of red <b>mudstones</b> are obviously different in distribution: the first type is close to eolian deposits, indicating their relevance to wind action in formation; the second type, partly similar to the first type, has obvious differences with the first type, which can be deduced that it is formed through secondary transformation; the third type embraces the alluvial characteristics, suggesting its good inheritance of the surrounding parent rocks in the distribution of REEs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTrACt: Lithofacies {{analysis}} has been undertaken on {{a suite of}} appar-ently monotonous organic-rich <b>mudstones</b> from the Upper Jurassic Kim-meridge Clay Formation (KCF) in the Wessex Basin, southern England.

5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing <b>mudstone</b> having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurus {{is known}} from fossils found in {{formations}} of the Karoo Supergroup, including the Upper Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which {{date to the}} Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200-190million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus {{was thought to be}} from the Upper Triassic period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple <b>mudstone</b> and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.|$|E
