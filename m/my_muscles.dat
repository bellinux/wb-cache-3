2500|$|Kim began skating {{at the age}} of 6. Her {{coach at}} the time, Ryu Jong-hyun, {{strongly}} suggested to Kim's mother that Kim should continue to skate, predicting that she would become a world-class figure skater in the future. In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her aptness for skating, stating, [...] "My coaches have told me <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> and body structure are perfect for skating. I was born with a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on and helped me develop that. A lot of people don't know they are born that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} back at four," [...] he remarked to Helen, [...] "when I shall {{lie down on the}} sofa and relax all <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> completely." ...|$|E
60|$|I sunk {{deeper in}} the shadow of my covert, and {{stiffening}} <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> for a protracted spell of rigidity, prepared to listen with all acuteness and intensity.|$|E
60|$|From then on I was mercilessly {{exploited}} by other capitalists. I had the muscle, {{and they made}} money out of it while I made but a very indifferent living out of it. I was a sailor before the mast, a longshoreman, a roustabout; I worked in canneries, and factories, and laundries; I mowed lawns, and cleaned carpets, and washed windows. And I never got the full product of my toil. I looked at {{the daughter of the}} cannery owner, in her carriage, and knew that it was <b>my</b> <b>muscle,</b> in part, that helped drag along that carriage on its rubber tyres. I looked at the son of the factory owner, going to college, and knew that it was <b>my</b> <b>muscle</b> that helped, in part, to pay for the wine and good fellowship he enjoyed.|$|R
6000|$|I {{smiled as}} she left me {{standing}} on the porch. This was the same spot on which her sister Genevieve had felt <b>my</b> <b>muscle.</b> [...] "This is an appreciative family," [...] I said, and, guided {{by the sound of}} voices, I found Mr. Larramie and his son Walter in the billiard-room.|$|R
50|$|During her career, Wild {{appeared}} on several recordings. Along with releases for Mad Violets (World of LSD... and the posthumously released Season of the Mad Violets), she sang on records for Bronski Beat, The Fleshtones, Peter Zaremba's Love Delegation, Hoodoo Gurus, and John Sex. She {{also appeared in}} two music videos with Mr. Sex, Hustle with <b>My</b> <b>Muscle</b> and Rock Your Body, {{as well as the}} 1988 documentary Mondo New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have practised a good deal," [...] Edgar said, quietly, [...] "having indeed {{little else}} to do, {{so it is}} not {{surprising}} that <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> are hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh! My legs is short, but I slog along slack at {{the knees}} an' don't worry <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> none, an' I can sure walk every piker here off the ice." ...|$|E
60|$|ADAM. The {{state of}} them that love death more than life. Go on with your spinning; and do not sit there idle while I am {{straining}} <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{you don't}} think I'm holding out because I enjoy it?" [...] I managed to gasp, {{for at the}} moment Pie-Face Jones was forcing his foot into my back in order to cinch me tighter, while I was trying with <b>my</b> <b>muscle</b> to steal slack. [...] "There is nothing to confess. Why, I'd cut off my right hand right now {{to be able to}} lead you to any dynamite." ...|$|R
60|$|How {{he did it}} I {{shall never}} know, nor does it seem {{credible}} that any Martian-born creature could approximate the marvelous speed of <b>my</b> earthly <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Michael Hogan of The Huffington Post {{said that}} [...] "I just {{finished}} watching the new episode of [...] "Homeland" [...] and boy, are <b>my</b> suspension-of-disbelief <b>muscles</b> tired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I braced {{myself for}} the effort. <b>My</b> <b>muscles</b> like {{tempered}} steel responded to the strain. I lowered a hundred fathoms of the line. I could already {{hear the voice of}} Kate far down the cliff.|$|E
6000|$|... "Das a puzzler, massa," [...] gasped Quashy, who {{had been}} {{rendered}} almost speechless by surprise, [...] "if de bu'stin'-power what's in my heart just now would on'y go into <b>my</b> <b>muscles,</b> I'd snap dem ropes like Samson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's unnatural," [...] I said. [...] "There's {{something}} about him--don't think me fanciful, {{but it gives}} me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of <b>my</b> <b>muscles,</b> when he comes near me. It's a touch--of the diabolical, in fact." ...|$|E
40|$|Myasthenia Gravis is a {{disorder}} in humans characterized by abnormally rapid exhaustion, with loss of {{strength in the}} muscles under voluntary control and a return of strength, at least in part, {{after a period of}} rest. The term MG comes from the Greek <b>mys</b> (<b>muscle),</b> asthenia (weakness), and from the Latin gravis (heavy) and implies a marked or severe muscle weakness. Jolly in 1895 (1) first used the Dame â€˜Myasthenia Gravis' to describe the syndrome. Be found upon repeated stimulation with faradic current a reaction of asthenia demonstrable by recording tracings...|$|R
60|$|We were in Glasgow next day, and the Major took us {{down to the}} depot, where {{a soldier}} with three stripes on his arm and a fistful of ribbons from his cap, showed every tooth {{he had in his}} head at the sight of Jim, and walked three times round him to have the view of him, {{as if he had been}} Carlisle Castle. Then he came over to me and punched me in the ribs and felt <b>my</b> <b>muscle,</b> and was nigh as pleased as with Jim.|$|R
60|$|Goaded to madness by {{the cruel}} misfortune that had tripped me when success was almost within my grasp, I tore frantically across the {{intervening}} space, and {{just beneath the}} rope's dangling end I put <b>my</b> earthly <b>muscles</b> to the supreme test.|$|R
60|$|I {{caught his}} hand and held on to it with all my power. The man's weight was a {{tremendous}} strain on <b>my</b> <b>muscles,</b> but fortunately they stood the test, and then I began to drag him over the rail.|$|E
60|$|Greaser came limping {{back into}} the cabin, and found a seat without any one speaking. It was so still that I heard the silken rustle of paper as he rolled a cigarette. Moments that seemed long as years passed, with <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> clamped as in a vise. If only I had lain down upon my back! But there I was, half raised on my elbow, in a most awkward and uncomfortable position. I tried not to mind the {{tingling}} in my arm, but to think of Hiram, of Jim, of my mustang. But presently I {{could not think of}} anything except the certainty that I would soon lose control of <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> and fall over.|$|E
60|$|The {{assembled}} {{warriors and}} chieftains examined me closely, feeling <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> and {{the texture of}} my skin. The principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform, and, motioning me to follow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.|$|E
60|$|As I {{wound up}} for the delivery, I held <b>my</b> nerves and <b>muscles</b> under {{absolute}} command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed. And then I let go, with every ounce of <b>my</b> weight and <b>muscle</b> and science in back of that throw. The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon {{the end of the}} nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.|$|R
60|$|If {{the fellow}} saw me there our chances of escape might quickly go glimmering, for I {{knew that they}} would put me in irons {{if they had the}} {{slightest}} conception of the wonderful agility which <b>my</b> earthly <b>muscles</b> gave me upon Mars.|$|R
60|$|Had I been a woman I {{should have}} wept. At my right was a great, slow-moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff's {{overhanging}} side, and to rest <b>my</b> tired <b>muscles</b> before turning back I let my boat drift into its embrace.|$|R
60|$|I pulled two {{or three}} little thorns out of my hand, and sat for a time on a boulder of rock. <b>My</b> <b>muscles</b> were quivering, and I had that feeling of {{personal}} disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner of cycling on earth.|$|E
60|$|Next morning I {{could hardly}} {{crawl out of}} my sleeping-bag. My bones ached, <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> protested excruciatingly, my lips burned and bled, and the cold I had {{contracted}} on the desert clung to me. A good brisk walk round the corrals, and then breakfast, made me feel better.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have escaped}} {{death in a}} dozen forms to follow Matai Shang and {{overtake}} him, and I {{do not intend to}} be led, like a decrepit thoat to the slaughter, from the goal that I have won by the prowess of my sword arm and the might of <b>my</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Pasques Dieu!" [...] {{cried the}} archer, {{loosening}} his jerkin, and eyeing his foeman {{over with the}} keen glance of one who is a judge of manhood. [...] "I have only once before seen such a body of a man. By your leave, my red-headed friend, I should be right sorry to exchange buffets with you; and I will allow {{that there is no}} man in the Company who would pull against you on a rope; so let that be a salve to your pride. On the other hand I should judge that you have led a life of ease for some months back, and that <b>my</b> <b>muscle</b> is harder than your own. I am ready to wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the other}} village {{boys in the}} school were two lads named Gallagher, one of whom, whose name was Matt, became my daily terror. He was {{two years older than}} I and had all of a city gamin's cunning and self-command. At every {{intermission}} he sidled close to me, walking round me, feeling my arms, and making much of <b>my</b> <b>muscle.</b> Sometimes he came behind and lifted me to see how heavy I was, or called attention to my strong hands and wrists, insisting with the most terrifying candor of conviction, [...] "I'm sure you can lick me." [...] We never quite came to combat, and finally he gave up this baiting for a still more exquisite method of torment.|$|R
60|$|It became {{manifest}} {{then that}} my knees were wabbling, my feet puttering around, my whole lower limbs shaking as if I had the palsy. I had {{lost control of}} <b>my</b> lower <b>muscles.</b> It was funny; it was ridiculous. It showed just what was my state of excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does sound}} a serious undertaking," [...] Matteo said, laughing; [...] "and I {{am afraid that}} I shall never see {{the view from the}} top of Etna. Certainly I shall not, if it will be {{necessary}} beforehand to be always exercising <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> by running up the stairs of high houses." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{that face}} {{vanished}} and blackness gathered round me, {{and in the}} blackness visions: of the living, resistless avalanche, of the snow-grave into which I had sunk--oh! years and years ago; of Ayesha demanding Leo's life at my hands. Blackness and silence, through which I could only hear the cracking of <b>my</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{sense of}} delicious dreaminess overcame me, <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> relaxed, and I {{was on the}} point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of {{approaching}} horses reached my ears. I attempted to spring to my feet but was horrified to discover that <b>my</b> <b>muscles</b> refused to respond to my will. I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as though turned to stone. It was then, for the first time, that I noticed a slight vapor filling the cave. It was extremely tenuous and only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight. There also came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume that I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain my mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom.|$|E
60|$|A single blow {{sent the}} black {{unconscious}} to the ground. Snatching up his long-sword, I sprang into the arena. The apes were almost upon the maidens, {{but a couple}} of mighty bounds were all <b>my</b> earthly <b>muscles</b> required to carry me to the centre of the sand-strewn floor.|$|R
6000|$|CASHEL. [...] And did I choose [...] My quick {{divining}} eye, my lightning hand, [...] <b>My</b> springing <b>muscle</b> and untiring heart? [...] Did I implant {{the instinct}} {{in the race}} [...] That found a use for these, and said to me, [...] Fight for us, and be fame and fortune thine? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard from}} Tobin {{the day before}} yesterday--nay, it was Friday. From him I learn that you are giving lectures on galvanism. Would to God I were one of your auditors! <b>My</b> motive <b>muscles</b> tingled and {{contracted}} at the news, {{as if you had}} bared them, and were 'zincifying' their life-mocking fibres.|$|R
