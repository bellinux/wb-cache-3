40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and orbital sanders, concrete and disc grinders as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s.

At {{this stage of the}} diffusion process, JIT implementations are more common and more advanced in large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers</b> than in small; consequently, U. S. businessmen's understanding of issues associated with JIT implementations in large manufacturers is more developed than that of small manufacturers. When small manufacturers represent about 96 percent of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> investigation of JIT implementations in small, as well as large, manufacturers is warranted. This survey study investigates JIT implementation differences between small and large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Ten management practices that constitute the JIT concept are used to examine implementation of JIT manufacturing systems. Odds ratio were constructed to determine if an association exists between implemented versus not implemented and manufacturer size for each JIT practice. Ten changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation are also assessed and examined in the study. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationships between implementation status of each of the JIT practices and of each of the changes in performance in small and large manufacturers. The results of the study show that the frequencies of the 10 JIT management practices implemented differ between the two groups of manufacturer size, and an association exists between the JIT practices implemented and manufacturer size. Moreover, the changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation vary, depending on implementation status of specific JIT management practices and manufacturer size. empirical study, just-in-time manufacturing, performance, manufacturer size, logistic regression...|$|R

40|$|Apple 2 ̆ 7 s {{success with}} the Apple iPhone has brought with it certain problems. Its success has engendered a {{community}} that has attempted to circumvent Apple 2 ̆ 7 s exclusive service agreement with AT 2 ̆ 6 T. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property law allows consumers to alter their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. The patent and copyright law first sale doctrine allows consumers to manipulate a product after it is purchased. As a result, manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. This iBrief considers whether limitation of warranties have the deterrence effect manufacturers desire. Said differently, it considers whether manufacturers can use warranty limitations to prevent consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner. The iBrief presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the probability and magnitude of the beneficial impact when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. This model, considered with other empirical evidence, suggests that Apple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>warranty</b> could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability. The iBrief concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale expectation of profits by raising consumer awareness of their warranty 2 ̆ 7 s quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product {{in a way that}} is outside the terms of the consumers 2 ̆ 7 authorized use...|$|R

40|$|Operation of {{electronic}} parts and circuits under extreme temperatures is anticipated in NASA space exploration missions {{as well as}} terrestrial applications. Exposure {{of electronic}}s to extreme temperatures and wide-range thermal swings greatly affects their performance via induced changes in the semiconductor material properties, packaging and interconnects, or due to incompatibility issues between interfaces that result from thermal expansion/contraction mismatch. Electronics {{that are designed to}} withstand operation and perform efficiently in extreme temperatures would mitigate risks for failure due to thermal stresses and, therefore, improve system reliability. In addition, they contribute to reducing system size and weight, simplifying its design, and reducing development cost through the elimination of otherwise required thermal control elements for proper ambient operation. A large DC voltage gain (100 dB) operational amplifier with a maximum junction temperature of 150 C was recently introduced by STMicroelectronics [1]. This LM 2904 WH chip comes in a plastic package and is designed specifically for automotive and industrial control systems.

We use direct measures of local air pollution regulation to estimate their effects on abatement investment. Re � neries not subject to these regulations are used as a comparison group. We study a period of sharply increased regulation between 1979 and 1992. Initial compliance with each regulation cost $ 3 million per plant and a further $ 5 million to comply with increased stringency. We construct measures of total factor productivity using Census of <b>Manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> output and materials data that report physical quantities of inputs and outputs for the entire population of re � neries. Despite high costs associated with the local regulations, productivity in the Los Angeles Air Basin re � neries rose sharply between 1987 and 1992, which was a period of decreased re � nery productivity in other regions. We conclude that abatement cost measures may grossly overstate the economic cost of environmenta l regulation as abatement can increase productivity...|$|R
