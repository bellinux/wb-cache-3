50|$|The {{most common}} {{infection}} {{is that of}} the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis or postpartum <b>metritis.</b> Risk factors include Cesarean section, the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes, multiple vaginal exams, manual removal of the placenta, and prolonged labour among others. Most infections involved a number of types of bacteria. Diagnosis is rarely helped by culturing of the vagina or blood. In those who do not improve, medical imaging may be required. Other causes of fever following delivery include breast engorgement, urinary tract infections, infections of the abdominal incision or episiotomy, and atelectasis.|$|E

50|$|Sheldon {{works on}} infections {{of the female}} {{reproductive}} system, particularly postpartum <b>metritis.</b> Using dairy cattle, he identified the bacteria that cause uterine disease, including novel strains of Escherichia coli that are adapted to the uterine environment. In addition, Sheldon showed that the bacterium Trueperella pyogenes becomes a pathogen in the uterus by secreting a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that damages stromal cells, once the epithelium is damaged after parturition. Sheldon uncovered the role for the innate immune system in the endometrium of the uterus, showing that epithelial and stromal cells, {{as well as the}} expected immune cells, have roles in host-pathogen interactions. Sheldon was the first to show that infections in the uterus disrupt the structure and function of the mammalian ovary. Sheldon also identified that ovarian cells sense and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to inflammation, and even damaging the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{what form}} of {{treatment}} is used, adjuvant therapy can have side effects, like all therapy for neoplasms. Chemotherapy frequently causes vomiting, nausea, alopecia, mucositis, myelosuppression particularly neutropenia, sometimes resulting in septicaemia. Some chemotheraputic agents can cause acute myeloid leukaemia, {{in particular the}} alkylating agents. Rarely, this risk may outweigh the risk of recurrence of the primary tumor. Depending on the agents used, side effects such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy, bladder damage, constipation or diarrhea, hemorrhage, or post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment. Radiotherapy causes radiation dermatitis and fatigue, and, depending on the area being irradiated, may have other side effects. For instance, radiotherapy to the brain can cause memory loss, headache, alopecia, and radiation necrosis of the brain. If the abdomen or spine is irradiated, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysphagia can occur. If the pelvis is irradiated, prostatitis, proctitis, dysuria, <b>metritis,</b> diarrhea, and abdominal pain can occur. Adjuvant hormonal therapy for prostate cancer may cause cardiovascular disease, and other, possibly severe, side effects.|$|E

Blood, placenta/caruncles and uterine contents were collected between day 1 and day 20 post-calving, and examined for the presence of bacteria and for viruses by virus isolation, BHV 4 DNA by BHV 4 -gB PCR and/or BHV 4 antibody titres. Bovine herpesvirus 4 was detected in 83 % of the cases with clinical signs of acute postpartum <b>metritis</b> by virus isolation and/or BHV 4 -gB PCR. An increase of BHV 4 antibodies was detected in all examined postpartum <b>metritis</b> cows and in the 3 cows without clinical <b>metritis.</b> Two of these 3 cows developed severe <b>metritis</b> a few dayss after collecting the first blood sample. A concurrent infections of BHV 4 and bacteria, mainly Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus sp., were detected in 73 % of the examined uterine contents collected from postpartum <b>metritis</b> affected cows.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of puerperal <b>metritis</b> prevalence in high yielding Holstein cows on productive (305 days, actual milk yields), reproductive (days to first estrus, days open and services per conception) variables and culling rates. Throughout the study, 2885 dairy records were collected from high yielding private Holstein dairy farm (average milk yield was up to 9000 kg) for 3 successive lactation seasons. Dairy cows were classified according to their uterine affection into two groups, healthy and those with puerperal <b>metritis.</b> Dairy cows which affected with puerperal <b>metritis</b> were diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of lactation. Metritic cows were diagnosed and treated at the discretion of the herd veterinarian. Affected dairy cows were grouped into four groups according to time of the puerperal <b>metritis</b> attack during the first 21 Days In Milk (DIM) as ( 15 DIM, respectively). Moreover, the dairy females were grouped into 3 groups according to frequency of puerperal <b>metritis</b> of once, twice and triple, respectively. Dairy cows were also grouped according to their calving season (winter, spring, summer and fall calving seasons). Productive, reproductive variables and culling due to puerperal <b>metritis</b> were detected from the on-farm record system (DairyComp 305). Results of this study revealed that, puerperal <b>metritis</b> had bad effects on high yielding cows productive and reproductive variables, that decreased the 305 milk yield, increased days to first estrus, days open and number of services per conception. Moreover, the occurrence of puerperal <b>metritis</b> increased during the warm months of spring and summer seasons. Also, the occurrence of such disease was increased during the first 10 days of postpartum as (89. 98 %) of the affected cases occurred within this period. Care must be directed to dairy cows which had a history of puerperal <b>metritis</b> as these cases had a greater tendency for recurrence. Also, the re- attacked cows with puerperal <b>metritis</b> had a great chance to be culled from the dairy herds, as they reached to (53. 33 % and 100 %) for the second and third attack, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{computer}} stored records of 293 dairy cows and 652 calvings reveals the effects of retained placenta and <b>metritis</b> complex on reproductive performance. The overall incidence rate of retained placenta was 11. 2 %. Retained placenta was 4. 6 {{times more likely to}} occur following twin births than following single births. Most cases of retained placenta occurred during the fall. Forty-five percent of that seasonal increase was explained by an increased number of calvings. <b>Metritis</b> complex was diagnosed following 54. 8 % of retained placenta cases. Retained placenta alone did not significantly impair reproductive performance. <b>Metritis</b> complex, in {{the presence or absence of}} retained placenta, caused a significant (P≤ 0. 05) increase in days open, services per conception, calving to first heat intervals and days from calving to first service. There is an indication (interaction P≤ 0. 1) that cows with both retained placenta and <b>metritis</b> complex are more severely affected than cows with either retained placenta or <b>metritis</b> complex alone. The influence of retained placenta on fertility appears to depend on the proportion of cows with retained placenta that have <b>metritis</b> complex...|$|E

Because of the importance of possible association of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and maternal <b>metritis</b> the present study was done to determine whether meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is associated with puerperal infection. Methods: In this case-control study 150 women with MSAF and 150 women with clear amniotic fluid (gestational age > 37 weeks) were compared for puerperal <b>metritis.</b> Results: Subjects’ educational level, gestational age, gravida, mean vaginal exams, route of delivery and mean neonatal weight were not significantly different between the two groups. But mean maternal age and neonatal Apgar were significantly different in the two groups.

40|$|The aim of {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} frequency of <b>metritis</b> and endometritis, also the effi cacy of ozone spray treatment in Holstein cows. The cows (n = 91) ranged from 2 to 7 years of age and were housed in two commercial dairy farms in the north-western region of Croatia. The study was conducted over the course of 1 year. The cows were divided into the three groups based on uterine fi ndings and diagnosis (<b>metritis,</b> endometritis and control). The fi rst group comprised cows suffering from <b>metritis</b> diagnosed on days 5 and/ or 15 following parturition. The second group included cows diagnosed with endometritis on days 25 and/or 45 after parturition. The third group included animals without clinical signs of uterine infl ammation. In cases when <b>metritis</b> or endometritis was established, ozone foam (Riger spray G) was inserted into the uterus. Ozone was applied by means of a vial containing ozonated foam under pressure for 5 seconds. The time to the fi rst postpartal insemination was shorter for controls compared to the <b>metritis</b> and endometritis groups (P< 0. 05). The days open until pregnancy was the longest (133 days) in cows with endometritis (n = 28). In the control group (n = 41) the days open until pregnancy was 125 days and in the group of cows treated for <b>metritis</b> (n = 22) was 120 days. Conception rates for the fi rst, second and third groups were 1. 86, 2. 21 and 1. 90, respectively.

40|$|This is {{the case}} study of a 5 -year-old Ayrshire cow that {{presented}} with unusual complications from severe puerperal <b>metritis.</b> Prior to presentation, she had an emphysematous twin calf that was removed by caesarian section. She was subsequently referred to Cornell after unsuccessful treatment for a presumed peritonitis. Rectal and ultrasonographic exams revealed extensive fluid- and gas-filled cavities {{on both sides of}} the abdomen, as well as significant uterine adhesions. Bilteral flank laparotomies revealed large, fluid- and fibrin-filled retroperitoneal cavities displacing the abdominal organs cranially and ventrally. Due to the poor prognosis for recovery, the cow was euthanized.
