On 13 December 1961, at Epstein's invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at The Cavern Club, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles' Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows) to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached Ron White, an EMI <b>marketing</b> <b>executive,</b> who contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group.

500|$|Marketing {{executives}} at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing Fight Club {{and at one}} point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title [...] "Fight Club" [...] embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered [...] "a bad joke" [...] by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Entertainment broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film. Linson believed that the [...] "ill-conceived one-dimensional" [...] marketing by <b>marketing</b> <b>executive</b> Robert Harper largely contributed to Fight Clubs lukewarm box office performance in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Bank {{customers}} in Nigeria are almost unanimous in decrying inefficiency {{and most have}} at some time or the other wished the Nigerian banks {{at least a little}} less of it. The concern for efficiency in managing the <b>marketing</b> <b>executives</b> in Nigerian banks prompted this study. The study was examined in the light of Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) and Efficiency Theory. A sample of 303 <b>marketing</b> <b>executives</b> from selected banks in Nigeria was determined using the finite multiplier. The hypothesis test results gave significant values of Wald Ch-Square for the intercept and individual response categories of research questions (p 0. 05) and definitely agree (no computed Wald Chi-Square result), which indicated the significance of the results. Hence management is responsible for setting the context within efficiency improvements can take place, and bear prime responsibility for identifying and implementing efficiency of the <b>marketing</b> <b>executives</b> in Nigerian banks. Granted that the bank as a whole would benefit less with inefficiency, and that the task of reducing inefficiency in managing the <b>marketing</b> <b>executives</b> is uphill, a programme of reducing inefficiency should be based on three major premises, namely: ` (i) that some are inefficient because they do {{not know what to do}} in given situations (structural inefficiency); (ii) that knowing what to do, some are inefficient because they do not want to do the right thing in given situations (primary o...|$|R
500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, and <b>marketing</b> <b>executive</b> Emma Greengrass {{first heard}} Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E

In an interview with Billboard, RCA <b>marketing</b> <b>executive</b> Aaron Borns remarked that the album was their main release of the holidays, quoting: [...] "The angle on this album is that, like all great Christmas records, it's about amazing vocal performances. That's what this is intended to be - an album launched this year but timeless and genre-defying." [...] In preparation for its release in the United States, RCA shipped a half-million units on Amazon.com and Target, which exclusively released a deluxe edition. A red LP pressing of Wrapped in Red by United Record Pressing followed the CD release on November 25, 2013, marking the first time an album by Clarkson was released on a vinyl record. A deluxe LP and CD edition was also released on the Sony Music store, which included a scarf, a holiday ornament and a snow globe, all of which were decorated in red as inspired from the album. An international promotion campaign was also planned for Clarkson, but was later halted due to her pregnancy.

When {{discussing}} her {{audition for}} the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{synthesize}} some theories because, seeing them in their individual forms, they could sometimes appear contradictory and confusing and may not help the managers of Nigerian banks to easily perceive what to do to motivate their <b>marketing</b> <b>executives</b> for appropriate organizational performance and job satisfaction in the industry. It is assumed that a universal theory of motivation would be more practical and understandable for meaningful use by bank managers. A sample of 303 was determined using the finite multiplier.
