500|$|Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Steading of the Hill Giant Chief {{as one of}} the ten best classic adventures. Stephen Colbert, {{who played}} Dungeons & Dragons as a child, reminisced about these modules: [...] "Those old [...] "Giants" [...] modules, those were tremendous. Those are some of my {{favorite}} memories: working <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> fire giant, frost giant, and storm giant castles." [...] Ken Denmead of Wired said the first module is a [...] "pretty easy crash-and-grab," [...] the second contains [...] "some really excellent treasure," [...] but the third is [...] "the end-all, be-all of hack-fests". According to Denmead, the hill giant adventure does not prepare players for the later adventures. Describing the difficulty of battling the fire giants he said, [...] "remember Bambi Versus Godzilla? You're Bambi".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] also concern Furtado's teenage period, with the singer {{describing}} the song's lyrical content as [...] "my swagger-in-spades, rhyme-writing 14-year-old self find liberation through hip hop and R attending 'music jams' in suburban Victoria". There are references to Furtado's favourite {{groups at the}} period [...] such as Salt-n-Pepa, A Tribe Called Quest and Blackstreet, {{many of whom were}} produced by Jerkins himself [...] and her teenage wardrobe. The song's title references the hoop earrings she liked to wear. Furtado said that the song describes [...] "a certain unique swagger you have at that young age and that the music gives you," [...] and that she was [...] "the kid who used to pick up the mic at parties and just rock the crowd, sing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the storm and know my voice could penetrate." [...] The singer stated that as [...] "hip-hop was super-exotic to us in Canada", she felt that [...] "it was very liberating, finding that confidence through the music".|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies, and in the subsequent press conference. Button felt the win {{was the best of}} his career so far, and stated that he had to fight hard to win the race: [...] "It was really a fight. I got a drive-through for speeding behind the safety car and I had to fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> about three times. Eventually, on the last lap I was chasing down Seb. He ran a little bit wide onto the wet part of the circuit and I was able to take the opportunity and take the win." [...] Button also praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory, in particular the moves to intermediate tyres. Vettel expressed his disappointment of making a mistake on the final lap, after driving a faultless race up to that point. Nevertheless, he was happy with second place, as he had increased his championship lead. Webber said he was happy to finish third after his incident {{at the beginning of the}} race, putting his recovery from fourteenth place down to correct tyre choices.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} Holroyd himself on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>through</b> the States," [...] said Sir John. [...] "I've ascertained that he, too, wants the railway." ...|$|R
60|$|After I {{had washed}} {{the dishes and}} staked the horses on new grass, I crossed the shallow river and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>through</b> the cedar-brakes {{up to the top}} of the hill shaped like a pack-saddle.|$|R
60|$|And then I {{awoke to}} reality, and found I {{had been sitting}} in my chair longer than I had intended. The band-stand was empty, the sun had set; I rose and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home <b>through</b> the {{scattered}} crowd.|$|R
2500|$|LuPone {{has stated}} about {{her time in}} Evita:" [...] 'Evita' was the worst {{experience}} of my life,' she said. 'I was screaming <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> a part that {{could only have been}} written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Doll", {{involves}} {{the fear of}} entering into situations unprepared. [...] "Wind Up" [...] was written {{about the relationship between}} musicians and journalists, wherein the latter tend to paint the former as convicted and reluctant. [...] "My Hero" [...] criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. On the record's closing track, [...] "New Way Home," [...] Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99. Through this journey, [...] "I realise that it’s OK, I can make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> all of this, and I’m not that freaked out at the end." [...] Three types of songs permeate the record: ballads, up-tempo tracks and combinations of the two. Grohl felt they were representative of the specific emotions he would feel after the divorce.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{slowly and}} on tiptoe, I picked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the {{weed-grown}} garden, and {{peered through the}} open doorway.|$|E
6000|$|I set out one {{afternoon}} to go a-fishing to Fair Haven, through the woods, {{to eke out}} my scanty fare of vegetables. <b>My</b> <b>way</b> led <b>through</b> Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of which a poet has since sung, beginning,-- ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Sir,--Apologies for {{not writing}} are {{frequently}} like apologies for not singing--the apology {{better than the}} song. I have fought <b>my</b> <b>way</b> severely <b>through</b> the savage hospitality of this country, the object of all hosts being to send every guest drunk to bed if they can.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{staggering}} thought. I could not but dwell upon it often as I made <b>my</b> lonely <b>way</b> <b>through</b> this virgin world. Then, quite suddenly, one day I {{stepped out of}} the peace of manless primality into the presence of man--and peace was gone.|$|R
60|$|And thereat I told of {{the healing}} of the ten lepers I had {{witnessed}} in Samaria on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> Jericho.|$|E
60|$|With {{no great}} {{difficulty}} I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the scrub {{and climbed the}} eminence of tumbled rocks that shut in the view.|$|E
60|$|The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through.</b> Every {{one seemed}} greatly excited. I heard a {{peculiar}} humming {{sound from the}} pit.|$|E
60|$|Most {{people will}} be easily able to imagine the state of nervous impatience and vague {{expectation}} in which I passed the allotted period of delay, after hearing such words as those Monkton had spoken to me. Before the half hour had quite expired I began to make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out <b>through</b> the ballroom.|$|R

6000|$|... "You must {{excuse me}} if I see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} <b>through</b> to the end. I daresay you would rather realize it gradually, inevitable as it is," [...] added Conolly, looking down with some pity at his drooping figure. [...] "I cannot help my habit of mind.

60|$|Service over, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> {{crowds of}} children, who stood {{staring at the}} {{marvelous}} stranger, and resumed my stroll along the London Road.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I tell you, Sir, I can't see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> it at all. Chance! what chance {{would there}} be, after {{what you have}} told me?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{had succeeded}} in making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the tunnel an odd picture {{presented}} itself, and one which will ever remain vivid in my memory.|$|E
60|$|It was a merciful {{relief to}} me when, in groping <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{forwards}} <b>through</b> the darkness, I struck against {{some portion of}} the furnishing of the church. Fortunately I was all strung up to tension, else I {{should never have been}} able to control instinctively, as I did, the shriek which was rising to my lips.|$|R
60|$|Consoling {{myself with}} the {{reflection}} that I could be of no practical assistance to him and remembering with some satisfaction that, by a fortunate accident, he was without his collar, which bears my name and address, I slipped round the off side of a Vauxhall bus, making no attempt at ostentation, and worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home <b>through</b> Lowndes Square and the Park.|$|R
60|$|If I had fully {{realised}} {{the meaning}} {{of all the things}} I had seen I should have immediately worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> round <b>through</b> Byfleet to Street Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I arrived but an hour ago," [...] Oswald replied, [...] "having made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the Welsh, on foot, {{with that}} tall fellow you saw without." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My visit here," [...] he remarked, [...] "might {{easily be}} misconstrued. Would it be {{possible}} for me to leave without fighting <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> that mob?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{pretend to}} deny it, {{because you know}} it is what every body talks of. I assure you I heard of it in <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, as she {{clapped her}} face to a window of the coach, [...] "if this isn't a reg'lar old-fashioned snow-storm! I've shoveled <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>through</b> many a one like it to git to the barn to do my milkin' afore the men folks had begun makin' paths, an' I feel jus' like as though I could do it ag'in." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{thought of}} the {{possible}} consequence, I darted into {{the shadows of the}} tunnel, feeling <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along <b>through</b> the gloom for some distance. The noises of the amphitheater had grown fainter and fainter until now all was as silent as the tomb about me. Faint light filtered from above through occasional ventilating and lighting tubes, but it was scarce sufficient to enable my human eyes to cope with the darkness, and so I was forced to move with extreme care, feeling <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along step by step with a hand upon the wall beside me.|$|R
6000|$|Later {{on in the}} {{day came}} a {{telegram}} in reply; it was addressed to Alan: [...] "Am on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out by <b>through</b> train to attend you. But {{as a matter of}} duty, marry the girl at once, and legitimatize your child while the chance remains to you." ...|$|R
60|$|As I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> {{the grounds}} I saw Audrey in the distance, walking with the Nugget. I avoided them {{and went on}} into the house.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{turned and}} went <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the crowded streets, where the people made place for me, the {{astronomer}} of Cleopatra, for my fame had spread abroad.|$|E
6000|$|Reeling, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> {{the smoke}} that now seemed to fill my lungs, to where I knew {{the door to}} be. Oh, horror! it was closed and secured! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{this rather}} an unnatural state of things?" [...] he asked {{when he had}} come up. [...] "I ought to be obliged to fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to you <b>through</b> {{successive}} phalanxes of young men crowding round with cups of tea outstretched in their imploring hands. Have you had some tea?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to my narrative. When I turned my back on Benicia, <b>my</b> <b>way</b> led <b>through</b> saloons. I had {{developed}} no moral theories against drinking, and I disliked as much as ever {{the taste of the}} stuff. But I had grown respectfully suspicious of John Barleycorn. I could not forget that trick he had played on me--on me {{who did not want to}} die. So I continued to drink, and to keep a sharp eye on John Barleycorn, resolved to resist all future suggestions of self-destruction.|$|R
60|$|A certain Sunday morning, I remember, {{broke with}} a cloud-flecked sky, {{and as we}} were {{preparing}} to go afield with such ploughs as could be got together (we were to sow turnips) the loud sounds of a quarrel came from the elm at the spring. With one accord {{men and women and}} children flocked thither, and as we ran we heard McGary's voice above the rest. Worming <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> boylike, <b>through</b> the crowd, I came upon McGary and Harrod glaring at each other in the centre of it.|$|R
