The Great Miami River is just more than half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the west, and Interstate 75 is just more than a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the west. In its current form, it is bounded by Brown Street to the west, Irving Avenue to the south, Trinity Avenue and Evanston Avenue to the east, and Caldwell Street and Stonemill Road to the north. This gives the area a roughly triangular shape.|$|E

5000|$|Boughton under Blean is also {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} Chaucer in Frank Herbert's Children of Dune: [...] "For a time he amused himself by reviewing Chaucer's route from London to Canterbury, listing the places from Southwark: two <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> the watering-place of St. Thomas, five <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Deptford, six <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Greenwich, thirty <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Rochester, forty <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Sittingbourne, fifty-five <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Boughton under Blean, fifty-eight <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Harbledown, and sixty <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> Canterbury. It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is to {{be found}} in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

5|$|Old Gisborough Hall was {{demolished}} around 1825 and the Chaloners built {{a mansion}} house, Gisborough Hall, {{about half a}} <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the east in 1857.

It remains the property of Lord Gisborough; English Heritage is responsible for maintaining the ruins, while day-to-day running is managed by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} {{regularly}} encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, {{with the best}} sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, {{where they can be}} seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December. Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage.|$|E

5|$|The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an {{area that}} was {{previously}} known as Pembroke, the name stemming from the 1650s, that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community. East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield, which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800. In 1821, it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836. The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright; {{with the intention of}} selling housing lots. The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one quarter of a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the south, but it was changed through public opposition, and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836. The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Bristol Harbour Railway was a {{joint venture}} by the GWR and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam-powered bascule bridge over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the railway was extended by half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> Wapping Wharf. In 1906, new branches from the south via the Ashton Avenue swing bridge were built to Canons Marsh {{on the north side}} of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut. A Coal Concentration Depot owned by Western Fuels was established at Wapping Wharf just behind the Industrial Museum but this closed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service station}} opened with the M5 and M50 motorways in November 1962, {{though none of}} the original buildings survive in use. The M5, which was built with dual two-lane carriageways, was extended southwards, from junction 8 in 1969, with dual three-lane carriageways. It was widened between junctions 3 and 8 to dual three-lane carriageways in the early 1990s including a remodelling of junction 8 (M50). The proximity of the northbound area to the remodelled junction would have caused issues with traffic trying to join and leave the motorway {{and so it was}} relocated half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> the north on a new larger site in 1991. The exit from the southbound services has been altered to feed directly into the M50 junction. The former northbound area is now in use as a maintenance area, though due to the motorway widening this can now only be accessed from the local road network.|$|E
