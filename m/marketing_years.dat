40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the pricing performance and behavior of market advisory services in corn and soybeans. Data on corn and soybean net price received for advisory services, as reported by the AgMAS Project, are available for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 <b>marketing</b> <b>years.</b> Performance test results suggest that, on average, market advisory services exhibit a small ability to "beat the market". This conclusion is somewhat sensitive to the type of performance test and market benchmark considered. The predictability results provide little evidence that future advisory service pricing performance can be predicted from past performance. Marketing profiles identify three marketing "styles": i) "scale-up" sales, ii) selective hedging and iii) "speculative" hedging. Advisory services tend to follow the same approach across crop years.

50|$|A <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> is {{a period}} of one year (or {{sometimes}} less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and disposition of a commodity. (Disposition of an agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, as well as changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and disposition of some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for a crop commences at about the time of harvest. However, world markets or other factors may also influence choice of beginning date for the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for some commodities in some countries. Especially in the case of certain perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> may be less than a full year in length, because economic activity of interest for reporting and analysis may be concluded within just a few months.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the performance of agricultural market advisory services in marketing wheat. Two key performance questions are addressed: 1) Do market advisory services, on average, outperform an appropriate wheat market benchmark? and 2) Do market advisory services exhibit persistence in their wheat performance from year-to-year? Market advisory service recommendations for wheat are available from the AgMAS Project for the 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 <b>marketing</b> <b>years.</b> At least 20 advisory programs are included for each year. Tests of pricing performance relative to a market benchmark are based on the proportion of programs exceeding the benchmark price and the average percentage difference between the net price of advisory programs and the benchmark price. In statistical terms, the pricing performance test results are clear. Not only do market advisory programs in wheat consistently fail to "beat the market," their performance is significantly worse than the market. The level of under-performance is striking and consistent, with the proportion of programs above market benchmarks for the four-year period ranging from 0. 34 to 0. 38. Estimates of the four-year average return relative to market benchmarks range from - 9. 61 to - 10. 48 percent. Tests of predictability are based on the correlation of performance measures for overlapping and non-overlapping adjacent <b>marketing</b> <b>years.</b> In general, the predictability results provide little evidence that future advisory program pricing performance can be usefully predicted from past performance. On average, correlations are positive for overlapping years (e. g. 1995 vs. 1996). However, correlations tend to be negative for non-overlapping years (e. g. 1995 vs. 1997), which implies that producers selecting top-performing programs based on a given year, and expecting them to continue to be top-performing funds, would actually experience just the opposite result. wheat, market advisory service, benchmark, market efficiency, pricing performance, predictability, Crop Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An annual {{model that}} {{explains}} the U. S. upland cotton farm price includes various market components, as well as government loan and storage programs in selected years. With the declining role of government agricultural programs, however, market supply and demand conditions, both in the United States and around the world, are now more influential in deter-mining U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address two basic perfoffilance {{questions}} for market advisory services: 1) Do market advisory services, on average, outperfoffil an appropriate market benchmark? and 2) Do market advisory services exhibit persistence in their perfOffilance from year-to-year? Data on corn and soybean net price received for advisory services, as reported by the AgMAS Project, are available for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 <b>marketing</b> <b>years.</b> Perfoffilance test results suggest that, on average, market advisory services "beat the market " for the 1995 through 1997 corn and soybean crops. Possible explanations for this result include: i) a unique time period in corn and soybean markets, ii) inefficient commodity markets, iii) the skillfulness of advisory services or iv) a return to risk. The predictability results provide little evidence that advisory service pricing perfoffilance can be predicted from year-to-year.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on a {{description}} of the winegrowing and wine-production in Australia, a country, which is becoming a more and more significant producer and exporter of wine in the world, and has become a part of competitive environment of the winegrowing and wine-production industry in the Czech Republic. Structural analysis of external environment is a part of strategic analysis of an industry, where one of the key parts is the analysis of competitive environment within an industry. Winegrowing areas of Australia are nowadays located mostly in the colder climatic zone of Australia. In the 70 -ies of the last century, there were planted new vineyards, in these areas, and the grapes from them have started to be used for production of quality-wine and the production of sweet wines and brandies have decreased. The most significant wine-production state has become the South Australia with the sound vineyards around the Murray River. The area of the productive vineyards has doubled, in the past seven years; most of the vineyards are under irrigation. The total grape production in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 was 1   514   501  t, where 56 % were the blue grapes. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002, there was produced 1   220  mil. litres of wine and 416  mil. litres were exported., whereas in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003 the exports amounted for 508  mil. litres of wine. Most of the wine was exported to the Great Britain – in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 it was 48 % of the total exports. In 2003 – 2004, were exported to the Czech Republic 466   914  litres of wine, which is an 850 % growth within the past four years. The average price of 1 litre of wine imported to the Czech Republic was 2. 16  €, in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, and have grown by 0. 28  € in the following year. Wine imports to Australia are decreasing from the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 1997 – 1998. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, the imports were 17  mil. litres of wine, for 81  mil €.
