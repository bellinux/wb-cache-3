5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E

5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled {{with the discovery of}} new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E
