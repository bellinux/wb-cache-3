5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{reactivation}} {{increases with}} immunosuppression, {{such as that}} caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year. Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought, with estimates that it <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> more than 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common. The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008, down from 8% in 1995.|$|E
5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have arrived}} {{but just in}} time, monsieur, for we are the last two left, and though we <b>might</b> have <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> a few more, another five minutes would have {{finished}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is just an}} idea of mine," [...] {{explained}} Lawrence. [...] "Of course I may {{be quite}} wrong, but it still {{seems to me that}} my mother's death <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by natural means." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> consistent foraging specializations across individuals: {{food source}} variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when {{the use of}} two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|One Majlis member {{recently}} {{stated that}} IRGC black-market activities alone <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> $12 billion per year. Iranian commander Mohammadreza Yazdi {{has stated that}} all IRGC economic activities are legitimate. Besides the IRGC, rogue elements within the Government of Iran, Bonyads and the Bazaar are allegedly involved in the smuggling activity.|$|E
60|$|The {{cardinal}} came, early; {{the ladies}} had not long left the dining-room. They were agitated when {{his name was}} announced; even Apollonia's heart beat; but then that <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by the inopportune recollection of an occasional correspondence with Caprera.|$|R
3000|$|... m, {{which also}} {{is to be}} {{expected}} on theoretical grounds. This correlation leads to a shift of the approximate point of convergence of the different straight lines. From a purely phenomenological point of view, this time shift <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> in the equation relating SURtc and K [...]...|$|R
30|$|Successive {{enhancement}} of low temperature depressed successful recovery of leaf photosynthesis of K. obovata seedlings mainly by impairing pigment synthesis, antioxidant metabolism, and sucrose translocation, {{as well as}} accelerating senescence of endopeptidase. Furthermore, our results suggest that decreases in sucrose content in leaves <b>might</b> also <b>account</b> <b>for</b> increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts.|$|R
25|$|Two morphs, {{a robust}} and a gracile one, {{were present in}} the fossil material. A study of the bone {{histology}} showed that both morphs were adult, so the lighter build of some bones was not caused by a young age. Individual variety or pathologies <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the difference but the simplest explanation is sexual dimorphism. It can as yet not be deduced which morph was male and which female.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, bones become {{harder and}} more brittle. At the {{conclusion}} of puberty, {{the ends of the}} long bones close during the process called epiphysis. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> decreased likelihood of black women developing osteoporosis and having fewer bone fractures there.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} REBT, {{the client}} {{together with the}} therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work {{through a set of}} target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are assessed in regards to the client's values and goals. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors. Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.|$|E
50|$|Kaspersky Lab {{found that}} certain victims that were {{infected}} with NetTraveler were also infected by Red October, although no direct relation with this malware was established. The multiple infections <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> {{by the fact}} that these were high profile victims like government agencies, nuclear power installations and embassies in dozens of countries.|$|R
40|$|The plasma urate {{concentration}} of 70 patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} increased progressively up to the seventh day and {{was significantly higher than}} in a group of 23 patients with ischaemic changes only. Diuretic treatment <b>might</b> have <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> an early rise in urate levels but the persistent increase seen at seven days could not be so explained...|$|R
6000|$|I {{explained}} {{my position}} as {{an acquaintance of}} Miss Hart's, interested in the mysterious disappearance of her father. It had {{occurred to me to}} make inquiries as to the state of his health, or, rather, his constitution, I added. Perhaps his prolonged absence <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by sudden and dangerous illness. Could Dr. Schofield give me any information? ...|$|R
25|$|One great {{topic of}} debate during the 1960s was whether quasars were nearby objects or distant objects as implied by their {{redshift}}. It was suggested, for example, that the redshift of quasars was {{not due to}} the expansion of space but rather to light escaping a deep gravitational well. However a star of sufficient mass to form such a well would be unstable and in excess of the Hayashi limit. Quasars also show forbidden spectral emission lines which were previously only seen in hot gaseous nebulae of low density, which would be too diffuse to both generate the observed power and fit within a deep gravitational well. There were also serious concerns regarding the idea of cosmologically distant quasars. One strong argument against them was that they implied energies that were far in excess of known energy conversion processes, including nuclear fusion. At this time, there were some suggestions that quasars were made of some hitherto unknown form of stable antimatter and that this <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> their brightness. Others speculated that quasars were a white hole end of a wormhole. However, when accretion disc energy-production mechanisms were successfully modeled in the 1970s, the argument that quasars were too luminous became moot and today the cosmological distance of quasars is accepted by almost all researchers.|$|E
500|$|These rings can be {{extended}} indefinitely to form a cyclol fabric (Figure 3). [...] Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely. [...] Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their amino-acid side chains point axially upwards from only one face; the opposite face has no side chains. [...] Thus, one face is completely independent of the primary sequence of the peptide, which Wrinch conjectured <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> sequence-independent properties of proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Postcolonial {{anthropologist}} Arjun Appadurai makes {{a similar}} {{point in his}} book Modernity at Large (1996) via an implicit critique of Wallerstein: [...] "The new global cultural economy has {{to be seen as}} a complex, overlapping, disjunctive order that cannot any longer be understood in terms of existing center-periphery models (even those that <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> multiple centers and peripheries)".|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} 6 % of our {{patients}} required post-operative in-patient admission following the procedure. We considered that the administration of general anaesthesia <b>might</b> have <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> many of the indications for admission, such as nausea, hypotension and vasovagal episodes. The recent advances in performing NovaSure under local anaesthesia [13], however, have comparable rates of post-operative in-patient admission (7 %) [14].|$|R
30|$|Almost all the {{boreholes}} in {{both dry and wet}} seasons recorded values {{below the}} WHO guideline value of 10  µg/l with {{majority of them}} also below detection. Se is used in the production of photocells, semiconductor, stainless steel and glass. However, none of the above industrial activities exists in the basin. This <b>might</b> have <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> the low levels recorded within the basin.|$|R
30|$|Some {{commentators}} on {{this paper}} {{have suggested that}} payroll tax noncompliance among employers of unskilled NLH workers <b>might</b> help <b>account</b> <b>for</b> those workers’ stronger NLH callback advantage. The very low statutory NLH tax rates in Table  1, however, imply that even complete noncompliance (zero taxes) among migrants’ employers would not substantially alter the skill profile of the NLH tax advantage.|$|R
2500|$|Kaolin is {{the primary}} {{material}} from which porcelain is made, even though clay minerals <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> only {{a small proportion of}} the whole. The word [...] "paste" [...] is an old term for both the unfired and fired material. A more common terminology these days for the unfired material is [...] "body"; for example, when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor.|$|E
2500|$|This illness slowed Ney {{down for}} a few years, but he {{eventually}} began to study the effect of radon gas in the atmosphere. [...] He thought that the ionization from radon, which comes from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in rocks, <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the high frequency of lightning over land, which had been demonstrated on OSO. [...] This research continued after his retirement in 1990, but did not reach a conclusion before he died on July 9, 1996.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first piece}} of primary {{evidence}} to {{be made available to}} the public was a memorandum written by the deputy base commander, Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Known as the [...] "Halt memo", this was made publicly available in the United States under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The memorandum, was dated [...] "13Jan 1981" [...] under the title [...] "Unexplained Lights". The two-week delay between the incident and the report <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> errors in the dates and times given. The memo was not classified in any way.|$|E
3000|$|The idea on {{counterflow}} superconductivity {{with reference}} to electron-hole bilayers was put forward in [10, 11]. The attempts to observe counterflow conductivity directly were done [12 – 14] for bilayer quantum Hall systems realized in GaAs heterostructures. In the latter systems superconducting behavior <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> magnetoexcitons [15, 16]. The effect is expected for the filling factors of Landau levels [...]...|$|R
60|$|The fire in {{the little}} kitchen was out, and the untidy remains of Mrs. Gribble's midday meal still disgraced the table. More and more dazed, the indignant husband could only come to the {{conclusion}} that she had gone out and been run over. Other things <b>might</b> possibly <b>account</b> <b>for</b> her behaviour; that was the only one that would excuse it.|$|R
2500|$|David Hume {{discussed}} {{the possibility that}} the entire debate about free will {{is nothing more than a}} merely [...] "verbal" [...] issue. He suggested that it <b>might</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by [...] "a false sensation or seeming experience" [...] (a velleity), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is certain}} that many {{participants}} of dancing mania were psychologically disturbed, {{but it is also}} likely that some took part out of fear, or simply wished to copy everyone else. Sources agree that dancing mania was one of the earliest-recorded forms of mass hysteria, and describe it as a [...] "psychic epidemic", with numerous explanations that <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the behaviour of the dancers. It has been suggested that the outbreaks may have been due to cultural contagion triggered, in times of particular hardship, by deeply rooted popular beliefs in the region regarding angry spirits capable of inflicting a [...] "dancing curse" [...] to punish their victims.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} moving to California, Beutler made {{one of his most}} {{important}} contributions. [...] A new colleague at the City of Hope and ultimately a lifelong friend, Susumu Ohno had recently demonstrated that the histologically observable Barr body present in the nuclei of mammalian female cells was a hyperchromatic X chromosome. [...] Beutler immediately recognized that this <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the variable expression of X-linked genes in females heterozygous for X-linked mutations. [...] He soon determined that random X chromosome inactivation causes tissue mosaicism in female mammals, in that each somatic cell expresses one (but not both) of the alleles of X-linked genes with which it is endowed. This he accomplished by showing that two populations of erythrocytes exist in the blood of African American women who are heterozygous for G6PD deficiency. [...] Mary F. Lyon independently hypothesized that variegated coat colors in mice might arise from random X chromosome inactivation. [...] This, too, flowed from Ohno’s observations.|$|E
2500|$|Eric Edward Khasakhala {{was born}} at Ebwali village in the British Colony and Protectorate of Kenya in Western Kenya, to Zakayo [...] "Daktari" [...] Kwendo and Damary Oyando on 26 March 1926. His father was an illustrious local preacher, and the first medical doctor and a {{clinical}} officer in Bunyore; hence the nickname of [...] "Daktari" [...] (Kiswahili term for physician). [...] His parents were the Luhya (Bantu Kavirondo) people of Bunyore; a gerontocratic acephalous society with a representative system of governance and collegial leadership structure composed of mainly a council of elders, theirs was a collegial system of Barraza to which his grandfather had been a member. [...] Thus, Khasakhala's formative years were spent as an apprentice of his father—often assisted him with his various preaching and doctoring initiatives; it's also quite likely that Khasakhala, as the eldest son, was at his father's side the Barraza sessions. This <b>might</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> his amicable reconciliatory political style since the Nyore council of elders were key instruments of resolving conflicts among the populaces of their boroughs, {{as well as any}} inter-clan disputes.|$|E
30|$|Product {{lifetime}} extension can be modelled by {{adapting the}} final demand coefficients by expecting {{a reduction in}} final consumption. However, {{it is important to}} consider a potential rebound effect of prolonging product lifetime caused by the expenditures on other product or service categories from the savings on final demand. Furthermore, modelling product lifetime extension <b>might</b> involve <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> potential changes of the production recipe of durable goods.|$|R
5000|$|David Hume {{discussed}} {{the possibility that}} the entire debate about free will {{is nothing more than a}} merely [...] "verbal" [...] issue.

6000|$|... "Your clothes, sir," [...] {{the landlady}} explained, and he bethought him, then, {{that the greater}} elegance and {{refinement}} of his French apparel must indeed proclaim his origin to one who had so many occasions of seeing travelers from Gaul.
