5|$|These findings, {{presented}} at the first <b>Monocot</b> Conference in 1993, {{with the addition of}} several studies that had become available in the interim, formed the basis of the 1998 consensus Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) ordinal scheme. Among other things, the Alismatales were expanded and new orders such as Acorales (a placement for Acorus) and Pandanales (which now represented the stemonoids as well as new families) added. While not formally assigning any supraordinal ranks, the classification did recognize an informal grouping of <b>monocot</b> orders as the commelinoids. Otherwise the APG recognized only six <b>monocot</b> orders (Acorales, Alismatales, Asparagales, Dioscoreales, Liliales and Pandanales). The last four were however grouped together in the resulting cladogram and most closely represent the concept of lilioids, although this left some unplaced <b>monocot</b> families, including Corsiaceae and Petrosaviaceae.|$|E
5|$|However, floral synapomorphy (shared characteristics) is rare {{since most}} {{conform to the}} general <b>monocot</b> pattern. This pattern is ancestral (plesiomorphic) for the lilioid monocots. Structural monosymmetry is rare, except for Orchidaceae.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of molecular phylogenetics, cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s {{resulted in a}} dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders (Liliales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales). Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders, Petrosaviales and Pandanales also segregate with this group, resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid <b>monocot</b> assemblage. This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups, alismatid, lilioid and commelinid monocots. The lilioids are paraphyletic {{in the sense that}} commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales.|$|E
50|$|In plant taxonomy, commelinids (originally commelinoids) (plural, not capitalised) {{is a name}} used by the APG IV {{system for}} a clade within the <b>monocots,</b> which in its turn is a clade within the angiosperms. The commelinids are the only clade that the APG has informally named within the <b>monocots.</b> The {{remaining}} <b>monocots</b> are a paraphyletic unit. Also known as the commelinid <b>monocots</b> it forms one of three groupings within the <b>monocots,</b> and the final branch, {{the other two groups}} being the alismatid <b>monocots</b> and the lilioid <b>monocots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The APG system {{establishes}} eleven {{orders of}} <b>monocots.</b> These form three grades, the alismatid <b>monocots,</b> lilioid <b>monocots</b> and the commelinid <b>monocots</b> {{by order of}} branching, from early to late. In the following cladogram numbers indicate crown group (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in mya (million years ago).|$|R
50|$|Amongst the <b>monocots</b> Acorales, {{the first}} {{branching}} clade has a secretory tapetum, {{while the other}} alismatid clade, Alismatales are predominantly plasmodial. Amongst the late branching clades, the lilioid <b>monocots</b> are nearly all secretory while the commelinid <b>monocots</b> are diverse with respect to tapetal pattern.|$|R
5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five <b>monocot</b> orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic {{is similar to that}} found in lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family, Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of DNA sequencing {{and the use}} of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected: Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic. The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups, which belonged to quite separate families and even orders. For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus, previously placed in Liliaceae s.l., were reclassified in families within Asparagales (in this case Asparagaceae). In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to Dahlgreen's Liliiflorae, which they designated as superorder Lilianae. They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical {{for the establishment of a}} <b>monocot</b> classification. They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic (having a common ancestor), a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly (excluding some descendants of a common ancestor). For instance, Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy, that of a petaloid perianth, yet in discussing his Lilliflorae admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic. Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders (Dioscoreales, Asparagales, Liliales, Melanthiales, Burmanniales and Orchidales) in his Liliiflorae.|$|E
25|$|Vascular bundles {{are present}} {{throughout}} the <b>monocot</b> stem, although concentrated towards the outside. This {{differs from the}} dicot stem that has a ring of vascular bundles and often none in the center. The shoot apex in <b>monocot</b> stems is more elongated. Leaf sheathes grow up around it, protecting it. This is true to some extent of almost all monocots. Monocots rarely produce secondary growth and are therefore seldom woody, with Palms and Bamboo being notable exceptions. However, many <b>monocot</b> stems increase in diameter via anomalous secondary growth.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{studies have}} both {{confirmed}} the monophyly of the <b>monocots</b> and helped elucidate relationships within this group. The APG {{system does not}} assign the <b>monocots</b> to a taxonomic rank, instead recognizing a <b>monocots</b> clade. However, there has remained some uncertainty regarding the exact relationships between the major lineages, {{with a number of}} competing models (including APG).|$|R
5000|$|Aside from {{cotyledon}} number, other broad {{differences have}} been noted between <b>monocots</b> and dicots, although these {{have proven to be}} differences primarily between <b>monocots</b> and eudicots. Many early-diverging dicot groups have [...] "monocot" [...] characteristics such as scattered vascular bundles, trimerous flowers, and non-tricolpate pollen. In addition, some <b>monocots</b> have dicot characteristics such as reticulated leaf veins.|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{significant}} {{advances in}} understanding angiosperm phylogeny, {{the position of}} <b>monocots</b> remains uncertain. We present here a phylogeny inferred from four genes that unambiguously unite <b>monocots</b> with eumagnoliids. A well-supported position for the <b>monocots</b> was obtained only after we replaced the available nuclear 18 S rDNA sequence data with data from phytochrome C in a matrix that also included plastid rbcL and ndhF and mitochondrial atp 1. Over 5000 base pairs of sequence data from 42 taxa were analyzed using Bayesian inference. The results of these analyses united <b>monocots</b> with the eumagnoliids in a well-supported clade. Although the substitution of phytochrome C for 18 S data led to a highly supported position for the <b>monocots,</b> comparison with more densely sampled single-gene studies revealed conflict among data sets. This indicates that larger data sets from each genome should be explored explicitly to evaluate {{the position of the}} <b>monocots,</b> and that each of these larger data sets also should be investigated for insight into potential sources of conflict...|$|R
25|$|Canna is {{the only}} member of the Liliopsida class (<b>monocot</b> group) in which {{hibernation}} of seed is known to occur, due to its hard, impenetrable seed covering.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a variant}} of the eustele found in monocots like maize and rye. The {{variation}} has numerous scattered bundles in the stem and is called an atactostele (characterestic of <b>monocot</b> stem). However, it is really just {{a variant of the}} eustele.|$|E
25|$|In <b>monocot</b> seeds, the embryo's radicle and {{cotyledon}} {{are covered}} by a coleorhiza and coleoptile, respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.|$|E
40|$|Plant seeds {{contain a}} large number of {{protease}} inhibitors of animal, fungal, and bacterial origin. One of the well-studied families of these inhibitors is the Bowman-Birk family(BBI). The BBIs from dicotyledonous seeds are 8 K, double-headed proteins. In contrast, the 8 K inhibitors from monocotyledonous seeds are single headed. <b>Monocots</b> also have a 16 K, double-headed inhibitor. We have determined the primary structure of a Bowman-Birk inhibitor from a dicot, horsegram, by sequential edman analysis of the intact protein and peptides derived from enzymatic and chemical cleavage. The 76 -residue-long inhibitor is very similar to that ofMacrotyloma axillare. An analysis of this inhibitor along with 26 other Bowman-Birk inhibitor domains (MW 8 K) available in the SWISSPROT databank revealed that the proteins from <b>monocots</b> and dicots belong to related but distinct families. Inhibitors from <b>monocots</b> show larger variation in sequence. Sequence comparison shows that a crucial disulphide which connects the amino and carboxy termini of the active site loop is lost in <b>monocots.</b> The loss of a reactive site in <b>monocots</b> seems to be correlated to this. However, it appears that this disulphide is not absolutely essential for retention of inhibitory function. Our analysis suggests that gene duplication leading to a 16 K inhibitor in <b>monocots</b> has occurred, probably after the divergence of <b>monocots</b> and dicots, and also after the loss of second reactive site in <b>monocots...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 334 - 355. This thesis {{examines}} the morphology and anatomy of <b>monocots</b> {{from the standpoint}} of both taxic and growth form diversity and attempts to address the problems encountered in classifying and naming the structures which comprise the axial system of <b>monocots.</b> The morphology and anatomy of the growth habits of a variety of <b>monocots</b> were described using standard sectioning and light microscope procedures...|$|R
5000|$|In {{some plants}} the flowers have no petals, {{and all the}} tepals are sepals {{modified}} to look like petals. These organs are described as petaloid, for example, the sepals of hellebores. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are {{also referred to as}} [...] "petaloid", as in petaloid <b>monocots,</b> orders of <b>monocots</b> with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid <b>monocots.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{genes in}} the {{flowering}} time pathway are conserved across all plants studied to date. However, {{this does not mean}} that the mechanism of action is similarly conserved. For example, the <b>monocot</b> rice accelerates its flowering in short-day conditions, while Arabidopsis thaliana, a eudicot, responds to long-day conditions. In both plants, the proteins CO and FT are present but in Arabidopsis thaliana CO enhances FT production, while in rice the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E
25|$|The Arecaceae are a {{botanical family}} of {{perennial}} climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees {{commonly known as}} palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the <b>monocot</b> order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical and subtropical climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged {{at the top of}} an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts.|$|E
25|$|The Arecaceae are notable among monocots {{for their}} height {{and for the}} size of their seeds, leaves, and inflorescences. Ceroxylon quindiuense, Colombia's {{national}} tree, is the tallest <b>monocot</b> in the world, reaching up to 60m tall. The coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica) has the largest seeds of any plant, 40–50cm in diameter and weighing 15–30kg each. Raffia palms (Raphia spp.) have the largest leaves of any plant, up to 25m long and 3m wide. The Corypha species have the largest inflorescence of any plant, up to 7.5m tall and containing millions of small flowers. Calamus stems can reach 200m in length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditionally}} listed {{differences between}} <b>monocots</b> and [...] "dicots" [...] are as follows. This {{is a broad}} sketch only, not invariably applicable, as {{there are a number}} of exceptions. The differences indicated are more true for <b>monocots</b> versus eudicots.|$|R
50|$|A major {{outcome of}} the {{classification}} was {{the disappearance of the}} traditional division of the flowering plants into two groups, <b>monocots</b> and dicots. The <b>monocots</b> were recognized as a clade, but the dicots were not, with a number of former dicots being placed in separate groups basal to both <b>monocots</b> and the remaining dicots, the eudicots or 'true dicots'. The overall scheme was relatively simple. This consisted of a grade consisting of isolated taxa (referred to as ANITA), followed by the major angiosperm radiation, clades of <b>monocots,</b> magnolids and eudicots. The last being a large clade with smaller subclades and two main groupings, rosids and asterids, each in turn having two major subclades.|$|R
50|$|The <b>monocots</b> {{form one}} of five major {{lineages}} of mesangiosperms (core angiosperms), which in themselves form 99.95% of all angiosperms. The <b>monocots</b> and the eudicots, are {{the largest and most}} diversified angiosperm radiations accounting for 22% and 75% of all angiosperm species respectively.|$|R
25|$|Rice, a <b>monocot,</b> is {{normally}} grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can {{survive as a}} perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area {{with the use of}} water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Cordyline australis, {{commonly}} known as the cabbage tree, cabbage-palm [...] or , is a widely branched <b>monocot</b> tree endemic to New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} release of the 1998 APG {{classification}} were two events: the publication of Kubitzki's major monograph on the monocots and the Second <b>Monocot</b> Conference. Kubitzki defined superorder Lilianae as all monocots except superorders Commelinae, Alismatanae and the Acoraceae, that is the four orders Asparagales, Liliales, Dioscoreales and Pandanales. The <b>Monocot</b> Conference devoted an entire section to Systematics of the Lilioids and included an update of their previous research by Chase and colleagues. On this occasion the latter felt that there was now enough data to put forward a definitive classification, defining the Lilioids as comprising the four orders placed in Lilianae by Kubitzki. Rudall and colleagues (2002) followed Chase (2000), in using the term [...] "lilioid monocots" [...] and again noting unresolved polytomy between these four orders and the remaining <b>monocot</b> clades (commelinids and Petrosaviaceae), although at that time the Petrosaviaceae were still unplaced.|$|E
5|$|Five orders {{make up the}} lilioid <b>monocots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The exact {{relationship}} between these eight groups is not yet clear, although there is agreement that the first three groups to diverge from the ancestral angiosperm were Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales. The term basal angiosperms refers to these three groups. Among the remaining five groups (core angiosperms), the {{relationship between}} the three broadest of these groups (magnoliids, <b>monocots,</b> and eudicots) remains unclear. Zeng and colleagues (Fig. 1) describe four competing schemes. Of these, eudicots and <b>monocots</b> are the largest and most diversified, with ~ 75% and 20% of angiosperm species, respectively. Some analyses make the magnoliids the first to diverge, others the <b>monocots.</b> Ceratophyllum seems to group with the eudicots rather than with the <b>monocots.</b> The 2016 Angiosperm Phylogeny Group revision (APG IV) retained the overall higher order relationship described in APG III.|$|R
50|$|Corsiaceae is {{a family}} of {{monocotyledonous}} flowering plants. The APG II system (2003) treats {{the family in the}} order Liliales, in the clade <b>monocots.</b> This is a slight change from the APG system, of 1998, which left the family unplaced as to order, but did assign it also to the <b>monocots.</b>|$|R
500|$|As Kron and Chase {{stated in}} 1995, this taxonomic unit {{had been in}} a {{considerable}} state of flux, with significant variation between the systems of Cronquist (1981), Thorne (1983, 1992), and Dahlgren (1985). When classification systems were based on morphological characters alone, lilioid species which clearly departed from the [...] "lily" [...] pattern were easily placed into separate families. For example, the Amaryllidaceae contained species whose flowers had six stamens and an inferior ovary. The Iridaceae contained those with three stamens and an inferior ovary. The remaining taxa were put together in a very broadly defined Liliaceae, usually refereed to as Liliaceae sensu lato (s.l.). The Cronquist system's definition, for example, is the broadest of all. Rolf Dahlgren and colleagues were responsible {{for one of the most}} radical reorganisation of families, and in their 1985 <b>monocot</b> monograph defined the two orders (Asparagales and Liliales) which contain the bulk of <b>monocot</b> geophytes, as constituting the lilioid monocots.|$|E
500|$|There was now enough {{new data}} to justify {{revising}} the APG system, {{and a new}} classification was issued in 2003. Although this resulted in changes within the orders, it {{did not affect the}} relationship between them. Lilioid monocots were discussed but not formally recognized (commelinids, renamed from commelinoids, being the only supraordinal grouping in the monocots to be named) and Petrosaviaceae remained unplaced. The second version of the APG coincided with the third <b>Monocot</b> Conference (2003), the findings from which, using additional molecular markers, helped to resolve some of the remaining questions regarding relationships within this assemblage. Petrosaviaceae was shown to be included in what Chase refers to as [...] "liliids" [...] and placed in order Petrosaviales, while Dioscoreales and Pandanales were demonstrated to be sister clades. Rapid advances in understanding <b>monocot</b> relationships necessitated the release of another revision of the APG classification (2009), which incorporated these advances. Further definition of the relationships between lineages using multiple markers is continuing.|$|E
500|$|All Narcissus species {{contain the}} {{alkaloid}} poison lycorine, {{mostly in the}} bulb {{but also in the}} leaves. Members of the <b>monocot</b> subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids, the norbelladine alkaloids, which are 4-methylcatechol derivatives combined with tyrosine. They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species. Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known, of [...] which 79 or more are known from Narcissus alone.|$|E
50|$|Topology of the {{angiosperm}} {{phylogenetic tree}} could infer that the <b>monocots</b> would {{be among the}} oldest lineages of angiosperms, which would support the theory that they are just {{as old as the}} eudicots. The pollen of the eudicots dates back 125 million years, so the lineage of <b>monocots</b> should be that old too.|$|R
5000|$|The term tepal {{is usually}} applied when {{the parts of}} the {{perianth}} are difficult to distinguish, e.g. the petals and sepals share the same color, or the petals are absent and the sepals are colorful. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as [...] "petaloid", as in petaloid <b>monocots,</b> orders of <b>monocots</b> with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid <b>monocots.</b> Examples of plants in which the term tepal is appropriate include genera such as Aloe and Tulipa. In contrast, genera such as Rosa and Phaseolus have well-distinguished sepals and petals.|$|R
