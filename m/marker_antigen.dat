The resulting sera have been previously shown to recognize enteroinvasive pathogens when used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the current study, Western blots (immunoblots) showed that such an absorbed rabbit antiserum recognized two proteins (IpaB and IpaC) which are encoded by a large, virulence-associated plasmid.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that generation of tumor specific CD 8 + T-cell responses occur via cross-priming; however {{the source of}} tumor antigen for this event is unknown. We examined the source and form of tumor antigen required for cross-presentation in the local lymph node (LN) using a syngeneic mouse tumor model expressing a <b>marker</b> <b>antigen.</b> We found that cross-presentation of this model tumor antigen in the LN is dependent on continuous traffic of antigen from the tumor site, but without any detectable migration of tumor resident dendritic cells (DCs). Instead, small numbers of tumor cells metastasize to local LNs where {{they are exposed to}} a localized CTL attack, resulting in delivery of tumor antigen into the cross-presentation pathway...|$|E

40|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the circadian rhythmicity in cancer patients. Since monitoring the disease usually implies the follow-up of blood concentrations of a number of biological variables, it would be of value to examine the profile of the circadian variations of serum cortisol and tumour <b>marker</b> <b>antigens.</b> This we did in 33 cancer patients (13 breast cancer patients and 20 ovarian cancer patients). The profiles of serum cortisol were documented, since this hormone is considered as a strong marker of circadian rhythms. This study shows that 8 out of 13 breast cancer patients and 15 out of 20 ovarian cancer patients had deeply altered cortisol circadian patterns. The modifications were either high levels along the 24 h scale and/or erratic peaks and troughs and/or flattened profiles. Within 24 h, variations of tumour <b>marker</b> <b>antigens</b> as large as 70 % were observed but no typical individual circadian patterns could be found. No relationship between cortisol subgroups and concentration of tumour <b>marker</b> <b>antigens</b> at 8 h could be observed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test).

40|$|Summary. The {{development}} of monoclonal antibody and enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) techniques has {{made possible the}} detection of specific antigens at extremely low concentrations. Diagnosis of recalcitrant diseases such as melioidosis depends upon either early isolation and identification of the causative organism or the identification of a specific <b>marker</b> <b>antigen,</b> Pseudomonas pseudomallei exotoxin, in serum; the latter is better because it allows more rapid and simple diagnosis. A method of detecting exotoxin concentrations of> 16 ng/ml by an ELISA based on a monoclonal antitoxin is here described; it is significantly more sensitive than the mouse lethality test (lower threshold 30 pg/ml) currently in use and an in-vitro cytotoxicity test (lower threshold 10 pg/ml) that we have developed and describe here...|$|E
40|$|Background: One {{bottleneck}} for adoptive T {{cell therapy}} (ACT) is recruitment of T cells into tumors. We hypothesized that combining tumor-specific T cells, modified with a <b>marker</b> <b>antigen</b> and a bispecific antibody (BiAb) that selectively recognizes transduced T cells and tumor cells would improve T cell recruitment to tumors and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods: SV 40 T antigen–specific T cells from T cell receptor (TCR) -I–transgenic mice were transduced with a truncated human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) as a marker protein. Targeting and killing by combined ACT and anti-EGFR–anti-EpCAM BiAb therapy was analyzed in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice (n = six to 12 per group) carrying subcutaneous tumors of the murine gastric cancer cell line GC 8 (SV 40 + and EpCAM+). Anti-EGFR x anti-c-Met BiAb was used for targeting of human tumor-specific T cells to c-Met+ human tumor cell lines. Differences between experimental conditions were analyzed using the Student’s t test, and differences in tumor growth with two-way analysis of variance. Overall survival was analyzed by log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The BiAb linked EGFR-transduced T cells to tumor cells and enhanced tumor cell lysis. In vivo, the combination of ACT and Biab produced increased T cell infiltration of tumors, retarded tumor growth, and prolonged survival compared with ACT with a control antibody (median survival 95 vs 75 days, P <. 001). In human cells, this strategy enhanced recruitment of human EGFR–transduced T cells to immobilized c-Met and recognition of tyrosinase+ melanoma cells by TCR-, {{as well as of}} CEA+ colon cancer cells by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) –modified T cells. Conclusions: BiAb recruitment of tumor-specific T cells transduced with a <b>marker</b> <b>antigen</b> to tumor cells may enhance efficacy of ACT...|$|E

40|$|The rat W 3 / 25 antigen was {{the first}} <b>marker</b> <b>antigen</b> of helper T {{lymphocytes}} to be identified. Subsequently, the human OKT 4 antigen (now called CD 4) was described, and cell distribution and functional data suggested that W 3 / 25 and OKT 4 antigens were homologous. This is now confirmed by the matching of peptide sequences from W 3 / 25 antigen with sequence predicted from rat cDNA clones detected by cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe for human CD 4. Analysis of the two sequences suggests an evolutionary origin from a structure with four immunoglobulin-related domains, although only domain 1 at the NH 2 terminus meets the standard criteria for an immunoglobulin-related sequence.

40|$|Abstract: A {{theoretical}} {{analysis was}} performed to deter-mine the number of fractions a multidisperse, immuno-magnetically labeled cell population can be separated into based on the surface <b>marker</b> (<b>antigen)</b> density.

Due to the normal distribution of cell diameters, a ‘‘randomizing’ ’ effect enters into the analysis, and an analogy between the ‘‘theoretical plate’ ’ analysis of dis-tillation, adsorption, and chromatography can be made. Using the experimentally determined, normal distribu-tion of cell diameters for human lymphocytes and a breast cancer cell line, and fluorescent activated cell screening data of specific surface marker distributions, examples of theoretical plate calculations were mad...|$|E

Therefore, lung specimens of 54 individuals with different natural and unnatural causes of death were investigated. In most lungs examined numerous alveolar macrophages with 1 - 2 nuclei were found. Polynuclear giant cells, which were arbitrarily defined as alveolar macrophages containing 3 or more nuclei, were observed in all groups investigated except {{in the cases of}} hypoxia due to covering the head with plastic bags.

However, the single cell data reveal that these substates are characterized by further heterogeneity that changes on culture adaptation. Notably the Adapted population includes cells with a transcriptome substate suggestive of a shift to a more naïve-like phenotype in contrast to the cells of the Normal population. Further, a subset of the Normal SSEA 3 (+) cells expresses genes typical of endoderm differentiation, despite also expressing the undifferentiated stem cell genes, POU 5 F 1 (OCT 4) and NANOG, whereas such apparently lineage-primed cells are absent from the Adapted population. These results suggest that the selective growth advantage gained by genetically variant, culture adapted human embryonic stem cells may derive in part from a changed substate structure that influences their propensity for differentiation...|$|E

Thirty-eight of 41 (93 %) well to moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and all cystadenocarcinomas were positive for CA 242. The staining was most intense in the apical border of the cells, and in the intraluminal mucus. Only two out of seven poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas stained, {{and the number of}} positive cells was smaller than in well differentiated carcinomas. Only occasional cells were stained in one out of five anaplastic carcinomas. Part of large ducts were positive in 91 % (21 / 23) specimens of chronic pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis small terminal ducts, centro-acinar cells and some large ducts stained for CA 242. In normal pancreas only a few small terminal ducts were CA 242 positive.
