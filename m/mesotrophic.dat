5|$|Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic}} of the area: ash–maple woodland (Fraxinus spp. and Acer spp.) often with abundant small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), calcareous grassland and <b>mesotrophic</b> grassland.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich <b>mesotrophic</b> grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in <b>mesotrophic</b> waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and <b>mesotrophic</b> grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|Under the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Whitton Bridge Pasture is {{considered}} as <b>mesotrophic</b> grassland because it represents well-drained and permanent pasture. In particular it {{is considered}} to be an MG5 community because of the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales, and Scotland, particularly in the Midlands. Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly subcommunity MG5c (Danthonia decumbens), however subcommunity MG5a (Lathyrus pratensis) is present with a substantially different species composition.|$|E
25|$|Long-stalked {{pondweed}} {{is one of}} {{the so-called}} Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion. However, in Britain at least, P. praelongus is now predominantly found in oligotrophic to <b>mesotrophic</b> waters.|$|E
25|$|Within the hillfort, a more <b>mesotrophic</b> {{grassland}} is present, {{most probably}} reflecting past agricultural use and improvement. There are also small areas of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), and elder (Sambucus) scrub, particularly along the lower {{slopes of the}} downland and on the earthworks. These provide valuable shelter for invertebrates on an otherwise open and exposed site.|$|E
25|$|The Whangamarino Wetland in the Waikato Region is {{the second}} largest wetland complex of the North Island of New Zealand. Encompassing a total area of more than 7200 {{hectares}}, the Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai manages 5,923 hectares of peat bog, swamp, <b>mesotrophic</b> lags, open water and river systems listed as a {{wetland of international importance}} under the Ramsar Convention. Fish and Game New Zealand are the second largest landowner, managing 748 hectares of the wetland primarily as gamebird hunting habitat.|$|E
25|$|Lakes can be also {{categorized}} on {{the basis}} of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. <b>Mesotrophic</b> lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Whangamarino Wetland {{consists}} of a rich and representative variety of wetland ecosystems (peat bog, swamp, <b>mesotrophic</b> lags, open water and river systems); one of the features that lent support to its designation under the Ramsar Convention. 239 species of wetland plants {{are found in the}} Whangamarino, 60 percent of which are indigenous. A number of these are uncommon or extremely rare, including the water milfoil Myriophyllum robustum, the clubmoss Lycopodium serpentinum, and the critically endangered swamp helmet orchid Anzybas carseii, now found nowhere else in the world. Baumea spp., mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and wire rush (Empodisma minus) are the dominant vegetation of the peat bogs while greater species diversity is found in the mineralised swamp zones, including introduced species such as grey willow (Salix cinerea) and crack willow (Salix fragilia). Mosses and lichens are also well represented in the wetland.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mesotrophic</b> {{classification}} {{was confirmed}} in 2005 by additional studies. [...] During {{the ten years}} prior to 2006, a new waste water plant was constructed, connecting nearly all the homes on Lake James to off-site waste treatment facilities. This removes {{a significant portion of}} nutrient loading in the lake, and should {{have a positive impact on}} future water quality.|$|E
500|$|The {{water in}} Hart Lake is quite murky due to {{suspended}} particles stirred {{up from the}} shallow bottom by wave action. [...] However, water clarity {{is not a good}} indicator of the lake's trophic state. [...] The amount of nutrients in the lake is very high; nitrate and phosphorus levels indicate a hypereutrophic condition. [...] This is counterbalanced by the chlorophyll level and related phytoplankton growth, which are typical of a <b>mesotrophic</b> lake. [...] This [...] is due to the reduced light level in the lake's cloudy waters, so overall, the lake is classified as eutrophic, with very high turbidity.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{classified}} Lake James as a <b>mesotrophic</b> lake in 1973, {{meaning that}} it had an intermediate level of nutrient enrichment. The EPA sampled the lake's water in May, August, and October of that year. [...] Water temperature for Lake James ranged from [...] in early August, and averaged [...] {{for all of the}} samples taken that day. [...] The lake's pH ranged between 7.3 and 8.5, with an average of 7.8. [...] Dissolved oxygen is necessary for fish and other water organisms, and most fish need 3 to 5 milligrams per liter. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Lake James ranged from 0.0 to 8.8 milligrams per liter for various depths during early August, and averaged 4.6.|$|E
2500|$|Under natural {{conditions}} Suttle Lake {{would probably be}} classified <b>mesotrophic.</b> However, the lake's current trophic state is eutrophic. [...] During the area's long winter season, the lake may return to a <b>mesotrophic</b> condition. [...] The water chemistry is normal except for a relatively high concentration of phosphorus that promotes the growth of planktonic algae. [...] There is aquatic plant life found along {{the periphery of the}} lake in a narrow zone down to a depth of about [...] However, most of the lake is too deep for macrophyte growth.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{historic}} data for Lake of the Woods, the natural conditions of the lake cannot be established. [...] However, the lake's trophic state is in the oligotrophic to <b>mesotrophic</b> range.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>mesotrophic</b> is also {{applied to}} {{terrestrial}} habitats. <b>Mesotrophic</b> soils have moderate nutrient levels.|$|E
50|$|British NVC {{community}} MG12 (Festuca arundinacea grassland) {{is one of}} the <b>mesotrophic</b> grassland {{communities in}} the British National Vegetation Classification system.

5000|$|The {{water quality}} was {{reported}} to be satisfactory [...] with a <b>mesotrophic</b> rating, improving to oligotrophic status , before dropping back to <b>mesotrophic</b> rating [...] Zebra mussel infestation is present. The ecology of Garadice Lough, and other Irish waterways, remains threatened by curly waterweed, and freshwater clam invasive species.|$|E
