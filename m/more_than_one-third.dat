5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon.

The Armenian chapel of Surp Stepanos, stood on the southeastern hill of the village {{until the beginning of}} the 19th century. On 23 April 1909, the Turks attacked and destroyed the village of Keorkeuna. In 1915, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of the villagers were killed during the Genocide. In 1947, 63 individuals from Keorkeuna migrated to Soviet Armenia, particularly from the Chelebian family. 114 individuals remained in the village after the migration process. Nowadays, the number of the residents of Keorkeuna significantly grows during the summer, when native Armenians of Keorkeuna who live in different cities of Syria or Lebanon, return to their houses for holiday. Many Armenian families from Aleppo have built private villas in the village. Keorkeuna is considered a calm summer resort for the Armenians of Aleppo and Latakia. Currently, the villages has around 25 families, with the two-thirds of them are Armenians and the rest are Arab Alawites. The only active church in Keorkeuna belongs to the Evangelical Armenians.|$|R

In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists.

5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing a shortest Euclidean 2 -connected Steiner network (SMN) {{for a set of}} terminals. This problem has natural applications in the design of survivable communication networks. A SMN decomposes into components that are full Steiner trees.

We use this result and the notion of reduced block-bridge trees of Luebke to show that no component in a SMN spans <b>more</b> <b>than</b> approximately <b>one-third</b> of the terminals. Furthermore, we show that no component spans <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two terminals on the boundary of the convex hull of the terminals; such two terminals must in addition be consecutive on the boundary of this convex hull.

5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature.

In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E

Using the dataset Sonda Maturant 1998, the authors show that entrance exams based on general aptitude tests may outperform the field-specific knowledge model in terms of providing access to talented students from a lower socioeconomic background. The simulations show that under the general aptitude regime the relative chances of an applicant with a university-educated father are only one-quarter higher than the relative chances of a student with a less educated father, compared to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a <b>one-third</b> difference in the case of the regime emphasising field-specific knowledge.

40|$|Background: The growing menace {{created by}} the HIV/AIDS (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has alarmed not only the public health officials but also the general community. The Voluntary Counseling and Testing Centre (VCTC) services have begun as a cost-effective intervention in reversing this epidemic. Objectives: 1) To study the sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive clients and their risk behaviors. 2) To elucidate {{the reasons for their}} visit to the VCTC and know the problems anticipated by the clients after revealing their HIV-positive status. Study Design: A cross-sectional record-based study. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in August 2007 among clients who tested positive for HIV in the VCTC of a district hospital in Karnataka from January to July 2007. Results: Study included 249 individuals of whom 161 were males and rest 88 females. A high percentage of nonresponse regarding the pattern of risk behavior was noted among the subjects (males: 42. 8 &#x 0025; and females: 90. 9 &#x 0025;). Of the individuals who responded, 91 males (98. 9 &#x 0025;) and 6 females (75. 0 &#x 0025;) had multiple heterosexual sex partners, while 1 male had homosexual partner. The figures in females show that two (25 &#x 0025;) of them had a history of blood transfusion. The reason for visiting the VCTC were cited as some form of illness (33. 3 &#x 0025;), confirmation of test results (32. 9 &#x 0025;), family members diagnosed as HIV positive (12. 9 &#x 0025;) and 11. 6 &#x 0025; were referred from Directly Observed Treatment Scheme (DOTS) center. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of the sample population anticipated discrimination at the time of medical treatment. Conclusion: People have begun using VCTC services, which reflects a change in their attitude toward HIV. The study provides us a clue to formulate an effective approach to educate people as well as the health personnel who are thought of as one of the important sources of discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The United States of America and Canada are {{culturally}} and economically similar, but {{the use of}} public transportation per capita is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice as high in Canada. This thesis examines national differences in transit use between the two countries and presents a detailed comparison of Boston and Toronto to better understand the reasons behind this large difference. Factors exogenous to transit policy explain much of the gap in transit use. Lower per capita income in Canada explains some of the difference. But the density of residential development and the location of employment are <b>more</b> important. Fewer <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> of new postwar American housing units were in multiple dwellings compared to almost one-half in Canada. Even though Boston is an older city, the density of the central portion of the metropolitan area is about one-third higher in Toronto. Equally important to the success of transit, employment is much more concentrated in the central area of Toronto. Policy differences between the two countries have heightened the gap in transit performance. The Canadian transit industry offers about twice as much transit service...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} on coalition formation is plagued by two serious problems. First, we cannot predict <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about <b>one-third</b> of the Western European governments, and, second, {{we do not}} have a good understanding of the causal mechanisms that explain the effects found in large-n coalition studies. This article illustrates that by combining statistical and case study analyses we can solve these problems. Since statistical analyses are well equipped for measuring and isolating effects, we argue that a coalition study should start with such an analysis. Predictions made in this analysis are then used to select cases. In order to study the mechanisms underlying effects found in large-n coalition studies, we argue for selecting cases that are predicted, and then applying the method of process verification. In order to find new explanatory variables, we argue for selecting cases that are deviant, and then applying the method of process induction. Substantive results of our analysis for coalition theory point to the importance of party strategies based on parties' past experiences, which aim at curtailing present and future costs of competing and governing with other parties...|$|R
