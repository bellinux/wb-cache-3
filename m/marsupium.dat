5|$|The Eumalocostraca {{contains}} {{the vast majority}} of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a <b>marsupium</b> in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes lobsters, crabs, shrimps, prawns and krill.|$|E
5|$|Individual mysids {{are either}} male or female, and {{fertilisation}} is external. The gonads {{are in the}} thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment {{and a pair of}} long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the <b>marsupium</b> and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the <b>marsupium</b> within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species Mysidopsis bahia, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although their numbers are usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} <b>marsupium.</b> The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E
5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the <b>marsupium,</b> located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} the {{seasonal}} abundance of B. giganteus juveniles and adults suggests a peak in reproductive capacity {{in the spring and}} winter months. This is observed to be due to a shortage of food during the summer. Mature females develop a brood pouch or <b>marsupium</b> when sexually active, the pouch being formed by overlapping oostegites or brood plates grown from the medial border of the pereiopods. The young isopods emerge from the <b>marsupium</b> as miniatures of the adults, known as mancae. This is not a larval stage: the mancae are fully developed, lacking only the last pair of pereiopods.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have large, {{powerful}} hind legs, large feet {{adapted for}} leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, {{and a small}} head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a <b>marsupium</b> in which joeys complete postnatal development.|$|E
500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "springbok" [...] {{comes from the}} Afrikaans words spring ("jump") and bok ("antelope" [...] or [...] "goat"); the first {{recorded}} use of the name dates to 1775. The scientific name of the springbok is Antidorcas marsupialis; anti is Greek for [...] "opposite", and dorcas for [...] "gazelle" [...] – identifying that the animal is not a gazelle. The specific epithet marsupialis comes from the Latin <b>marsupium</b> ("pocket"); it refers to a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the midline of the back from the tail. In fact, this physical feature distinguishes the springbok from true gazelles.|$|E
500|$|The eggs, {{which may}} number {{up to several}} hundred, are brooded by the female in the <b>marsupium,</b> a chamber formed by flat plates known as oostegites under the thorax. This is filled with water even in {{terrestrial}} species. The eggs hatch as mancae, a post-larval stage which resembles the adult except {{for the absence of}} the last pair of pereopods. The lack of a swimming phase in the life cycle is a limiting factor in isopod dispersal, and may be responsible for the high levels of endemism in the order. As adults, isopods differ from other crustaceans in that moulting occurs in two stages known as [...] "biphasic moulting". First they shed the exoskeleton from the posterior part of their body and later shed the anterior part. The giant Antarctic isopod Glyptonotus antarcticus is an exception, and moults in a single process.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of a}} mysid bears {{two pairs}} of {{antennae}} {{and a pair of}} large, stalked eyes. The head and first segment (or sometimes the first three segments) of the thorax are fused to form the cephalothorax. The eight thoracic segments are covered by the carapace which is attached only to the first three. The first two thoracic segments bear maxillipeds which are used to filter plankton and organic particulate from the water. The other six pairs of thoracic appendages are biramous (branching) limbs known as pereopods, and are used for swimming, as well as for wafting water towards the maxillipeds for feeding. [...] Unlike true shrimps (Caridea), females have a <b>marsupium</b> beneath the thorax. This brood pouch is enclosed by the large, flexible oostegites, bristly flaps which extend from the basal segments of the pereopods and which form the floor of a chamber roofed by the animal's sternum. This chamber is where the eggs are brooded, development being direct in most cases.|$|E
2500|$|A female {{woodlouse}} {{will keep}} fertilised {{eggs in a}} <b>marsupium</b> {{on the underside of}} her body until they hatch into offspring that look like small white woodlice curled up in balls. The mother then appears to [...] "give birth" [...] to her offspring. [...] Females are also capable of reproducing asexually.|$|E
2500|$|Mature females bear a <b>marsupium,</b> or brood pouch, {{which holds}} her eggs {{while they are}} fertilised, and until the young are ready to hatch. As a female ages, she {{produces}} more eggs in each brood. Mortality is around 25%–50% for the eggs. There are no larval stages; the eggs hatch directly into a juvenile form, and sexual maturity is generally reached after 6 moults. Some species {{have been known to}} eat their own exuviae after moulting ...|$|E
2500|$|As a marsupial, {{the female}} opossum has a {{reproductive}} system {{that includes a}} bifurcated vagina, a divided uterus and a <b>marsupium,</b> which is her pouch. The average estrous cycle of the opossum is about 28 days. [...] Opossums do possess a placenta, but it is short-lived, simple in structure, and, unlike that of placental mammals, is not fully functional. The young are therefore born {{at a very early}} stage, although the gestation period is similar to many other small marsupials, at only 12 to 14 days. Once born, the offspring must find their way into the <b>marsupium</b> to hold on to and nurse from a teat. Baby opossums, like their Australian cousins, are called joeys. Female opossums often give birth to very large numbers of young, most of which fail to attach to a teat, although as many as thirteen young can attach, and therefore survive, depending on species. The young are weaned between 70 and 125 days, when they detach from the teat and leave the pouch. The opossum lifespan is unusually short for a mammal of its size, usually only two to four years. Senescence is rapid.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} biomes present in Bhimbandh, {{grassland}} and forest. The sanctuary area has mainly sal forest, forest, Bamboo forest, grassland and many small forests of many miscellaneous species of flora.

2500|$|An {{apocryphal}} story recounts {{that the}} 12th century Hoysala king Veera Ballala II, {{while on a}} hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place [...] "benda-kaal-uru" [...] (literally, [...] "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into [...] "Bengalūru". Suryanath Kamath has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name, being derived from benga, the Kannada term for Pterocarpus <b>marsupium</b> (also known as the Indian Kino Tree), a species of dry and moist deciduous trees, that grew abundantly in the region.|$|E
2500|$|Bihar has {{notified}} {{forest area}} of , which is 7.2% of its geographical area. The sub Himalayan foothill of Someshwar and the Dun ranges in the Champaran district are another belt of moist deciduous forests. These also consist of scrub, grass and reeds. Here the rainfall is above [...] and thus promotes luxuriant Sal {{forests in the}} area. The most important trees are Shorea Robusta, Sal Cedrela Toona, Khair, and Semal. Deciduous forests also occur in the Saharsa and Purnia districts. Shorea Robusta (sal), Diospyros melanoxylon (kendu), Boswellia serrata (salai), Terminalia tomentose (Asan), Terminalia bellerica (Bahera), Terminalia Arjuna (Arjun), Pterocarpus <b>Marsupium</b> (Paisar), Madhuca indica (Mahua) are the common flora across the forest of Bihar.|$|E
60|$|MARSUPIALS.--An {{order of}} Mammalia {{in which the}} young are born in a very {{incomplete}} state of development, and carried by the mother, while sucking, in a ventral pouch (<b>marsupium),</b> such as the kangaroos, opossums, etc. (see MAMMALIA).|$|E
6000|$|Now the opossums are {{unlike most}} mammals {{in that they}} possess two bones {{attached}} to the fore part of the pelvis, which are commonly called [...] "marsupial bones." [...] The name is a misnomer, originally conferred because {{it was thought that}} these bones {{have something to do with}} the support of the pouch, or <b>marsupium,</b> with which some, but not all, of the opossums are provided. As a matter of fact, they have nothing to do with the support of the pouch, and they exist as much in those opossums which have no pouches as in those which possess them. In truth, no one knows what the use of these bones may be, nor has any valid theory of their physiological import yet been suggested. And if we have no knowledge of the physiological importance of the bones themselves, it is obviously absurd to pretend that we are able to give physiological reasons why the presence of these bones is associated with certain peculiarities of the teeth and of the jaws. If any one knows why four molar teeth and an inflected angle of the jaw are very generally found along with marsupial bones, he has not yet communicated that knowledge to the world.|$|E
60|$|If {{you want}} a perfect model of {{domestic}} virtue, for example, where can you find it in higher perfection than in that exemplary and devoted father, the common great pipe-fish of the North Atlantic and the British Seas? This high-principled lophobranch is so careful of its callow and helpless young that it carries about the unhatched eggs with him under his own tail, in what scientific ichthyologists pleasantly describe as a subcaudal pouch or cutaneous receptacle. There they hatch out in perfect security, free from the dangers that beset the spawn and fry of so many other less tender-hearted kinds; {{and as soon as}} the little pipe-fish are big enough to look after themselves the sac divides spontaneously down the middle, and allows them to escape, to shift for themselves in the broad Atlantic. Even so, however, the juniors take care always to keep tolerably near that friendly shelter, and creep back into it again on any threat of danger, exactly as baby-kangaroos do into their mother's <b>marsupium.</b> The father-fish, in fact, has gone to the trouble and expense of developing out of his own tissues a membranous bag, on purpose to hold the eggs and young during the first stages of their embryonic evolution. This bag is formed by two folds of the skin, one of which grows out from each side of the body, the free margins being firmly glued together in the middle by a natural exudation, while the eggs are undergoing incubation, but opening once more in the middle to let the little fish out as soon as the process of hatching is fairly finished.|$|E

50|$|The <b>marsupium</b> or brood pouch, is a {{characteristic}} feature of Peracarida, including the orders Amphipoda, Isopoda and Cumacea. It is an egg chamber formed by oostegites, which are appendages which {{are attached to}} the coxae (first segment) of the first pereiopods.

5000|$|During a female's second (occasionally third) winter, they release pheromones, {{picked up}} by a male's antennae, {{signaling}} that they're ready to mate. The male then clings on to the female, until the female molts. Then, the male releases its sperm into the female's <b>marsupium,</b> and the female releases up to 200 eggs. When the sea water becomes diluted, the eggs may swell up, to keep the total salinity around the embryos constant.
