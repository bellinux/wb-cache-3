5|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how water flows {{in a system}} of streams and rivers) are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> flow network as a spanning tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> drainage divide as the complementary spanning tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.|$|E

Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models to understand how and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's strength is <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computing protein design and predicting protein structure and docking.|$|E

In January 2011, Fassbender was confirmed to have joined the cast of Prometheus. Fassbender was provided with {{a significant amount of}} free rein for <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> character as he saw fit. Rather than taking inspiration from the previous Alien installments, Fassbender studied Sean Young's character Rachael, a replicant in Blade Runner, noting her vacant demeanor. Fassbender drew inspiration from a number of other film performances, including Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 in , David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, and Dirk Bogarde in The Servant. Additionally, Fassbender modeled his walk around American Olympic diver Greg Louganis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Many {{models have}} been created around the world {{over the last four}} decades or so to {{describe}} snowmelt runoff. Some 18 different models are listed and summarized in the Snow Hydrology Guide (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 1989). The World Meteorological Organization (1986) also lists and summarizes 18 different snowmelt runoff models. These many models are listed here in Table F- 1. a. This section will focus on describing six snowmelt models that have been demonstrated as valuable operational models or are thought to have a high potential for future operational use by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. These models are as follows:. <b>The</b> SSARR <b>Model</b> (<b>the</b> Streamflow Regulation and Reservoir Regulation <b>Model)..</b> <b>The</b> HEC- 1 and HEC- 1 F <b>Models</b> (<b>the</b> Hydrologic Engineering Center - 1, 1 F <b>Model)..</b> <b>The</b> NWSRFS <b>Model</b> (<b>the</b> National Weather Service River Forecast System <b>Model)..</b> <b>The</b> PRMS <b>Model</b> (<b>the</b> Precipitation Runoff <b>Modeling</b> System <b>Model).</b> <b>The</b> SRM (the Snowmelt Runoff M...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> response-averaging <b>model</b> {{used here}} is {{slightly}} different from <b>the</b> response-averaging <b>model</b> by Reynolds et al. [8]. In our <b>model</b> <b>the</b> average is calculated over the currents for each stimulus, while in their <b>model</b> <b>the</b> average is calculated over the firing rates for each stimulus. The reason is as follows. In a spiking neuron <b>model</b> like <b>the</b> LIF <b>model,</b> <b>the</b> generation of each single spike {{rather than the}} firing rate is <b>modeled.</b> Whether in <b>the</b> probability-mixing <b>model,</b> <b>the</b> response-averaging <b>model</b> or any other <b>model,</b> <b>the</b> spiking is affected by stimuli only through currents. Our model is formulated based on this idea, using a unified spike-generating mechanism for both the probability-mixing and <b>the</b> response-averaging <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> resulting firing rate averaged over a time window from a weighted average of single stimuli, {{will also be a}} weighted average of firing rates from single stimuli but with different weights. Our response-averaging <b>model</b> therefore provides <b>the</b> same consequence in terms of firing rates as <b>the</b> <b>model</b> by Reynolds et al.|$|R
