5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as argon or helium. When used for MIG welding, [...] use is sometimes referred to as <b>MAG</b> <b>welding,</b> for Metal Active Gas, as CO2 can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid laser 2 ̆ 013 metal {{active gas}} (<b>MAG)</b> arc <b>welding</b> is an {{emerging}} joining technology that is very promising for shipbuilding applications. This technique combines the synergistic qualities of the laser and <b>MAG</b> arc <b>welding</b> techniques, which permits a high energy density process with fit-up gap tolerance. As the heat input of hybrid laser 2 ̆ 013 arc welding (HLAW) is greater than in laser welding, but much smaller than in <b>MAG</b> arc <b>welding,</b> a relatively narrow weld and restricted heat affected zone (HAZ) is obtained, which can minimize the residual stress and distortion. Furthermore, adding MAG arc can increase the penetration depth for a given laser power, which can translate to faster welding speeds or fewer number of passes necessary for one-sided welding of thick plates. In this work, a new hybrid fiber laser 2 ̆ 013 arc welding system was successfully applied to fully penetrate 9. 3 mm thick butt joints using a single-pass process through optimization of the groove shape, size and processing parameters.

40|$|The {{design of}} highly loaded crane {{structures}} {{is linked to}} the fatigue life assessment of welded structures in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) regime. In the FOSTA research project P 900 <b>MAG</b> <b>welded</b> butt joints and transverse stiffeners made of 8 mm thick sheets as well as tube- clevis-components were investigated using the nominal stress, the notch stress and the notch strain concept. Constant amplitude loading fatigue tests up to the LCF regime result in Wohler curves, which fulfill FAT class 80 (butt joints) and FAT 71 (transverse stiffeners) according to the recommendations and can be estimated with a slope of k = 3. A fatigue life increase can be achieved by post weld treatment methods, even in the LCF regime. In addition to knowledge about the cyclic material behavior, the effect of a Gaussian spectrum on the fatigue life has to be considered. A fatigue life increase under variable amplitude loading is shown by Ga ss ner curves and characteristic damage sums resulting from a linear damage accumulation. The results have been extended to sample component investigations of tube-clevis connections. A fatigue assessment using local approaches confirms FAT 225 for the effective notch stress approach up to N 103 cycles.

40|$|The high {{alloying}} {{degree of}} Duplex stainless steels makes them {{susceptible to the}} formation of intermetallic phases during their exposure to high temperatures.

The effect of linear welding energy on the structure morphology of the welded joints was revealed by macro- and micrographic examinations, X-ray energy dispersion analyses, measurements of ferrite proportion and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results obtained showed that the transformation of ferrite into austenite is associated with the chromium, nickel, molybdenum and nitrogen distribution between these two phases and their redistribution degree is closely linked to the overall heat cycle of the welding process. The adequate control of the energy inserted in the welded components provides an optimal balance between the two microstructural constituents (Austenite and Ferrite) and avoids the formation of undesirable intermetallic phases...|$|R
