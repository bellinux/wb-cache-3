50|$|The Indian black turtle (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga)</b> or Indian pond terrapin is {{a species}} of {{medium-sized}} freshwater turtle found in South Asia.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 100 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} {{occur in the}} Eastern Ghats. Many endangered species are also present, including the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), Indian black turtle (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga),</b> Indian flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata), Indian tent turtle (Pangshura tentoria), Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), Leith's softshell turtle (Nilssonia leithii), {{many of which are}} found in the northern rivers and riverine valley tracts.|$|E
50|$|Endemic Bufo atukoralei, Fejervarya limnocharis, Polypedates maculatus, Banded bull frog, and Microhyla rubra {{are among}} the {{amphibians}} of the national park. Python molurus, Rat snake, Chrysopelea spp. Boiga spp., Dryophis spp., and Russell's viper {{are among the}} notable reptiles. <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> and Lissemys punctata are two freshwater turtles that inhabit in the tank of Lahugala.

50|$|Park {{reptiles}} {{include the}} Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), common monitor (Varanus bengalensis), water monitor (Varanus salvator), black-tailed python (Python molurus), krait (Bungarus spp.), common cobra (Naja naja), mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), and estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). Other reptiles associated with aquatic habits are Indian black turtle (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga)</b> and Indian flap-shelled turtle (Lissemys punctata). Of fishes barbs (Barbus spp.), giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy), snakeheads (Channa spp.), catfish (Siluriformes) and exotic tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) are predominant in the reservoirs.|$|E
50|$|This turtle inhabits dense {{evergreen}} forest, presumably {{at lower}} elevations. According to the natives from whom Dr. Henderson obtained the type, the species inhabits short burrows underground and is indifferent about having water nearby (unlike {{some of its}} relatives, which are decidedly aquatic). The type as well as another younger specimen were kept in captivity for six months, and Dr. Henderson remarks {{that they did not}} show any special partiality for water and when handled did not emit the offensive odour known from the related Indian Black Turtle (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{freshwater}} fish {{are dominated by}} exotic species (i.e. Oreochromis spp., Osphronemus goramy) and also endemic species such as Esomus thermoicos, Garra ceylonensis, Schistura notostigma also have been recorded from the park. Important fish species of the villus are climbing perch Anabas testudineus, snakeheads Ophiocephalus stratus and O. parulius, Labeo sp., branded etroplus Etroplus suratensis, butter catfish Ompok bimaculatus and the introduced tilapia Tilapia mossambica. The marshy habitat harbors a large population of reptiles including natricine watersnakes, mugger crocodile Crocodylus palustris, and estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus. Indian black turtle <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> and Indian flap-shelled turtle Lissemys punctata are the other aquatic reptiles reported.|$|E
40|$|Coprological {{examination}} of ten Pink-ringed tent turtles Kachuga tentoria circumdata, recently imported from India, and three Burmese black turtles <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> edeniana, imported from Myanmar, revealed {{the presence of}} two new species of Eimeria. Oocysts of Eimeria kachua n. sp. from K. t. circumdata are broadly oval to subspherical, 15. 3 (13 - 18) × 13. 9 (12 - 16) µm, with polar granule and subspherical oocyst residuum. Sporocyst elongatelly oval to spindle-shaped, 8. 7 (7. 5 - 10) × 4. 9 (4 - 6) µm, with a knoblike Stieda body, covered with fine membranous cupola-like structures. Thin walled oocysts of Eimeria patta n. sp. from M. t. edeniana, have an irregular shape, influenced by the position of sporocysts, frequently with lobular irregularities, 12. 6 (11 - 16) × 9. 1 (7. 5 - 12) µm. Sporocysts are oval to ellipsoidal, 5. 8 (5 - 7) × 4. 2 (3. 5 - 5) µm...|$|E
40|$|Soft shell turtles {{are among}} the most {{threatened}} groups of freshwater animals that are in need of urgent conservation attention. In Kerala (South India), two species of freshwater turtles, the Indian black turtle or Indian pond terrapin, <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> coronata (Schweigger, 1812) and the Indian Flap-shelled turtle Lissemys punctata punctata (Lacépède, 1788) are exploited from Vembanad lake and associated wetlands in Punnamada to meet the demand from local restaurants and toddy shops. Eight hundred and forty three individuals belonging to the two species (499 pond terrapins and 344 flap-shelled turtle) were observed during a field survey conducted in 2007 at Punnamada. Despite being listed at the highest level in the Indian wildlife protection act, very little law enforcement takes place and turtles are exploited and traded regularly. Collection and trade have also become {{an important component of the}} local livelihoods in Punnamada, with the involvement of around five full-time and 25 part-time collectors. Details of the collection, marketing, economics and management of the freshwater turtles in Punnamada are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{systematic}} {{position of}} the rare Indian turtle Geoemyda silvatica Henderson is examined by a phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequence data (cytochrome-b gene) of most species of Geoemydidae. Geoemyda silvatica represents a basal and isolated taxon within Geoemydidae, definitely not a close relative of any species of Geoemyda or Heosemys, the genera in which G. silvatica has been placed in the past. Therefore, the new genus Vijayachelys is proposed for G. silvatica. Cranial morphology and some other osteological characters of Vijayachelys silvatica are described and illustrated. Differential diagnoses are given for the type species of Melanochelys and the respective type species of the superficially similar genera Geoemyda, Heosemys, and Leucocephalon. According to Bayesian analysis of mtDNA data, <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> could be distantly related to V. silvatica, whereas the morphological similarity of the other species probably {{is the result of}} a similar mode of life. The discovery of the phylogenetically isolated position of V. silvatica highlights the importance of the Western Ghats as a biodiversity hotspot rich in higher-level endemics...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{new species}} of anurans that include six dicroglossids (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, Fejervarya pierrei, F. teraiensis and F. nepalensis, from Samdrup Jongkhar, Nanorana conaensis and N. pleskei from Haa), three megophryids (Xenophrys major and X. glandulosa from Trashiyangtse, and X. minor from Mongar) and four ranids (Amolops mantzorum from Trashiyangtse, Hylarana taipehensis and Sylvirana leptoglossa from Samdrup Jongkhar and S. cf. guentheri from Mongar) and one testudine a geoemydid (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga</b> from Sarpang), one sauria an anguid (Ophisaurus {{gracilis}} from Zhemgang) and two colubrids (Amphiesma platyceps and Dinodon gammiei both from Paro) are reported {{for the first time}} from Bhutan. Discussions have been restricted to their presence and the distribution in and outside Bhutan. As such, this paper provides the geographic locations, morphometric measurements (in some cases), time when they were seen in their habitat and information on who have collected the data of the species reported. The quality of the data is highly variable being collected opportunistically by various individuals from various places over the last six years...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{diversity}} intrinsically pedals {{the functioning}} and stabilization of an ecosystem. Among faunal diversity herpetofaunal (amphibians and reptiles) checklist serve {{a major role}} which provide the information of productivity and community dynamics. The present study was carried out at Durgapur, West Bengal, India from August 2009 to July 2011 with the objective to register the seasonal diversity and abundance of herfetofauna {{in and around the}} industrial region with special reference to the anthropogenic interventions. Diverse habitat types were surveyed applying hand capture, opportunistic spotting, road kill analysis, call survey and acquiring information from local people. Present survey revealed the richness of the Durgapur industrial area in its herpetofaunal diversity where 9 species of amphibians and 24 species of reptiles were recorded in the study area with the highest abundance observed during the rainy season. Duttaphrynus melanostictus was the most common amphibian species to register while Mycrohyla ornata was the rarest. So far as the reptilian diversity is concerned only one species of turtle (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga),</b> eight species of lizards and fifteen snake species were recorded. An overall negative anthropogenic influence on herpetofaunal diversity, distribution and abundance was evidenced from the present study and needs further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to know the seasonal variation in plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon cells during the reproductive cycle of untreated <b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga.</b> Pancreatic endocrine cells were immunochemically localized. Insulin-immunoreactive (IR) cells occurred in groups of 3 - 20 and were in close apposition, while glucagon-IR cells were distributed individually between the exocrine pancreas or formed anastomosing cords where cells were not intimately attached. Whenever both IR cell types were present together forming an islet, insulin-IR cells formed clusters in the centre with glucagon-IR cells being scattered at the periphery. Glucagon-IR cells seemed to be secretory throughout the pancreas during the reproductive cycle, while insulin-IR cells {{were found to be}} pulsating in their secretion. Mean size of the islet was 1. 306, 0. 184 and 2. 558 mm in the regenerative, reproductive and regressive periods, respectively. In general, insulin-IR cells measured 5. 18 mu m and glucagon-IR cells 5. 22 mu m in their longest axis. Invariably, glucagon-IR cells were more in number than insulin-IR cells. The fasting plasma glucose level was 69. 97 mg% during the regenerative period, which increased to 97. 96 mg% during the reproductive period, and reached a peak value of 113. 52 mg% in the regressive period...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} during January to December 2006 to assess the status of faunal diversity of Savar Upazila, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 30 species of birds, 24 species of winter birds, 7 species of reptiles, 3 species of amphibians, 15 species of mammalians and 32 species of fishes were recorded. Relative abundance of those species were determined. Of the birds, House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) was abundant while Blyth's Kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), Rock Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis), Hooded Pitta (Pitta sordida), Black-headed Oriole (Oriolus xanthornus), White-winged Duck (Cairina seululala) and Duck (Anser indicus) were rare. The relative abundance of winter bird could not be assessed because of their migratory habit. Striped keelback (Amphiesma stolata) and Common Smooth Water Snake (Enhydris enhydris) were very common while Black pond turtle (Geoclyms hamiltonii) and Pond tortoise (<b>Melanochelys</b> <b>trijuga)</b> were recorded as endangered. Common Toad (Bufo melanostictus) were abundant but Bull Frog (Rana tigrina) was rare. Asiatic Wild Dog (Cuon alpinus) and House Mouse (Mus musculus) were abundant while Common Otter, Large Indian Civet, Irrawaddy River Dolphin, Indian Hare were rare. Carpu, Silver carp, Tilapia, Nilotica were abundant while, Freshwater Garfish, One stripe spinyeel and Grey Featherback were rare. Landfilling, deforestation, poaching, industrial effluents and current jal were identified as major threats to the faunal diversity of Savar area. </p...|$|E
