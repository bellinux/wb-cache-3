5000|$|The patents {{at issue}} were for modular steel shell panels {{that could be}} {{arranged}} into vandalism resistant walls. The panels interlocked by means of steel baffles - internal barriers meant to create fillable compartments or to deflect projectiles that penetrate the outer wall. Defendant AWH Corporation distributed similar <b>modular</b> <b>panels,</b> and Plaintiff, Phillips, sued AWH for patent infringement. AWH asserted that its panels did not meet all {{of the limitations of}} Phillips' patent claims. The District Court granted AWH's summary judgment motion for noninfringement because it read the term [...] "baffles" [...] in the claims to mean internal barriers angled at angles other than 90 degrees. AWH's panels had baffles angled at 90 degrees. [...] Phillips appealed to the Federal Circuit. The panel affirmed the judgment of noninfringement, but on different grounds from the District Court. The Federal Circuit then agreed to rehear the case en banc.|$|E

5000|$|In 1932, {{he founded}} General Houses, Inc. in Chicago to design, sell, and erect {{low-cost}} prefabricated housing. The {{basis of the}} houses that the company designed and built was a coordinated system of prefabricated steel-framed <b>modular</b> <b>panels,</b> of which there were eight kinds: solid, small window, large window, glass, entrance door, kitchen door, double doors, and a fireplace. All of the panels were four feet wide and all were nine feet high except for the fireplace panel, which was taller. A garage door panel was the same height as the other panels but twice the width. As modules, the panels could be assembled {{in a wide variety}} of configurations to suit individual clients and specific sites. One General Houses house, built on the side of a hill, had three stories, with the living room on the topmost floor to best enjoy the view.

Similarly, the One was a kick start only model whereas others were available with electric start. Also the One model runs on a generator instead of a 12 volt battery like other models and many other Peugeot scooters, this causes the indicators to be very dim, the horn to be poor sounding and quiet and there to be no lights on the small dash other than a two-stroke warning light.

40|$|A {{green wall}} is a wall {{partially}} or completely covered with greenery that includes a growing medium, such as soil. Most green walls also feature an integrated water delivery system. Green walls are also known as living walls or vertical gardens. Green walls are used as one of means which for many years {{have been used to}} enrich the appearance of building elevations. They make it possible to introduce greenery into urban areas, which are often limited {{by the size of the}} building plot. They add an exceptional aesthetic aspect to the so-called ‘blind’ walls found in city centers.

In this publication, five different methods of setting up living walls are described, from the relatively simple technique of planting climbers that easily cover bare walls to <b>modular</b> <b>panel</b> systems or green wall systems with flower pots to ‘living wall’ solutions and finally, to Patrick Blanc’s highly sophisticated vertical garden technology...|$|R
