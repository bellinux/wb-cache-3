5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy <b>money</b> <b>or</b> other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E
