40|$|Data from <b>Marine</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> 1 (MOS- 1) were {{received}} starting from February 1989 at Syowa Station, Antarctica, by the newly installed Multi Purpose Satellite Data Receiving System (11 m antenna). The data {{of more than}} 200 paths are to be received per year, in order to study polar atmosphere, ice sheet and sea ice using three sensors, MESSR, VTIR and MSR. 2 HDDTs were brought back to Japan; they are composed of 13 paths acquired {{at the beginning of}} the system operation. Quick look films of these data were made, and some typical scenes of MESSR, VTIR and MSR were processed at NASDA EOC. Interesting features such as a giant iceberg are found among these processed images. Some limits of practical use of MESSR depending on the gain and solar elevation angle are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the overview of mission requirements, sensors, and a satellite {{system of the}} Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Mission objective of the ALOS is to advance landobserving technology and to contribute to cartography, regional observation, disaster monitoring, and Earth resource survey. The ALOS has three major sensors; Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instruments for Stereo Mapping (PRISM), Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR- 2), and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). The ALOS is planned for launch in August 2002 by the H-II launch vehicle. 1. INTRODUCTION Japan's Earth observation satellite program began with the <b>Marine</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> (MOS- 1) in February 1987. MOS- 1 {{was followed by the}} MOS 1 b in February 1989 and the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS- 1) in February 1992. JERS- 1 has 18 m resolution optical sensor and 18 m resolution L-band (1. 2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar on board. The Advanced Earth O [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> (MOS) - 1 is {{the first}} Japanese earth {{observation}} satellite, launched in February 1987. It has a Microwave Scanning Radiometer (MSR) with the frequencies of 23. 8 GHz and 31. 4 GHz. On February 9 and 10, 1988,an MOS- 1 airborne verification program for snowpack {{was carried out by}} the National Space Development Agency (NASDA), in the central part of Hokkaido, Japan. Several flights were carried out by an aircraft-mounted MSR, synchronized with MOS- 1,together with field experiments for obtaining ground truth data of the snowpack in the same area. Seven test sites were set up along the flight route from Iwamizawa to Sapporo at appropriate intervals. Snowpack parameters such as density, temperature profiles, snow depth, stratigraphy and so forth were measured at each site using pits digged in the snowpack. Continuous observations of the microwave properties and stratigraphic features of the snowpack were also carried out at the site in Sapporo using an FM-CW radar with frequency 6 - 12 GHz. A comparison between ground truth data and data obtained by MSR for snowpack was made and the following are concluded : 1) The brightness temperature obtained by the MSR exhibits a remarkable sensitivity to snow depth and water equivalent of snowpack. 2) Snow depth/water equivalent and the brightness temperature obtained by MSR are correlated with a regression line having a negative slope. However, when the snowpack is covered with a new snow layer, the regression line slope is inverted. 3) The seasonal variations in the brightness temperature obtained by MSR on MOS- 1 are correlated with those of snow depth and snow extent in the area...|$|E

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Africa {{to the impact}} of climate change, which results in natural disasters and environmental degradation, accelerates hardship and poverty for millions of Africans. However, Africa still lacks the necessary scientific and technical capacity to assess fully and to monitor the possible future impacts of climate change. One of the instruments available to address the challenges of environmental monitoring (including climate change) and to provide early warnings of natural and human-made disasters for Africa's development is Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> record Earth's information from space and provide accurate, continuous, simultaneous measurements of our planet. The results of the application of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> have long term social benefits which include the early detection of hurricanes and typhoons that can lead to prompt warnings for areas predicted to be affected, thus providing crucial time to implement safety measures to mitigate the effects of such disasters. Several authors concur with this position, stating that the global view from <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> is unmatched in its ability to capture the dynamics and variability of Earth processes. The capability to predict weather (among other things) has led Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> to become essential to everyday applications that improve human safety and quality of life. However, despite the many benefits of the use of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites,</b> it still remains a major challenge for Africa to explore the full potential of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> in addressing continental needs (Figure 1).
