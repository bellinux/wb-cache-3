5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness <b>measurement</b> <b>devices,</b> even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind <b>measurement</b> <b>devices.</b> Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E
40|$|A {{user-friendly}} handheld <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> {{in combination}} with a field-effect-based capacitive electrolyte-insulator-semi conductor (EIS) sensor has been developed. The <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> allows the characterisation of various chemical sensors and biosensors in both the capacitance-voltage (C/V) and the constant-capacitance (ConCap) mode. The developed device has been systematically tested with pH-sensitive EIS sensors in terms of accuracy, reliability and noise behaviour. Many possible applications {{for this type of}} semiconductor-based sensor with the associated convenient handheld <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> {{can be found in the}} biotechnology environment. First practical aspects and considerations to apply EIS-based sensors together with the new handheld <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> for pH <b>measurements</b> in a cell-culture medium will be reported.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} realization of an online <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> used for Joint Internal Thread. The online <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> adopts the principle that the shaft section of two dimensional tooth profile of Joint Internal Thread was obtained with the passive contact method. A novel first derivative segmentation method based on the dynamic linear regression was used to classify and identify the two-dimensional tooth profile data. The basic and derived parameter of Joint Internal Thread was then quickly calculated. The tooth height of Joint Internal Thread {{was used as the}} traceable standard to calibrate the online <b>measurement</b> <b>device.</b> The comparison between field experiment data and manually measured data shows that the online <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> is a rational design which works stably, shortens the measurement time largely, and improves the efficiency.

While this method of power transmission is not as efficient as conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor {{as in the case of}} use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields.

25|$|The {{most modern}} electrometers {{consist of a}} solid state {{amplifier}} using one or more field-effect transistors, connections for external <b>measurement</b> <b>devices,</b> and usually a display and/or data-logging connections. The amplifier amplifies small currents {{so that they are}} more easily measured. The external connections are usually of a co-axial or tri-axial design, and allow attachment of diodes or ionization chambers for ionising radiation measurement. The display or data-logging connections allow the user to see the data or record it for later analysis. Electrometers designed for use with ionization chambers may include a high-voltage power supply, which is used to bias the ionization chamber.|$|E
25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E
