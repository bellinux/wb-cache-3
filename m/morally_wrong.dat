Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie <b>morally</b> <b>wrong.</b> In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene {{to stop the}} genocide. In Yugoslavia, MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E

Scott {{argues that the}} peasant's [...] "crisis subsistence insurance" [...] would not be respected by the rational colonial state, unaware and unwilling to compromise with local complexity. The tax system is identified by Scott as the [...] "major institutional threat to peasant welfare". Indeed, the colonial states were {{more powerful than the}} previous indigenous governments. The peasants felt morally let down by the state that would rather pursue its own interests while continuing the extract mercilessly, with a [...] "blind rigor". The infuriated peasants felt <b>morally</b> <b>wronged</b> and turned to revolt as a desperate measure. Thus, the moral economy of peasants refers to the system of values that underpin the expression of emotions, that in turn may have a political dimension.|$|R

25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always <b>morally</b> <b>wrong,</b> the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|Their {{fundamentally}} different beliefs {{in regards to}} science led the Alterans to hide their level of scientific belief {{so that they would}} not get into a conflict. Eventually, the Ancients decided to build a space ship and leave rather than to use their technology, like the Ark of Truth, to defeat the Ori. Though they had the ability to stop the Ori, they thought it to be philosophically and <b>morally</b> <b>wrong.</b> The film thus addresses the non-interference policy of the Ancients under the Ori threat, and how they act millions of years later, when SG-1 succeeds in killing the Ori.|$|E

40|$|When we {{evaluate}} actions {{from the}} moral point of view, {{we can do}} this in two very different ways. We can consider them as <b>morally</b> right or <b>wrong,</b> but we can also judge them morally good or bad. Even though the distinction between right and good is generally recognized by moral philosophers, there is a tendency in contemporary ethics either to oversimplify it or to blur it altogether. Most philosophers focus on motives when they investigate this problem. I will, however, show that there are also other good–making factors and moreover, I will argue that all of them are traits of the agent’s personality. To this aim, I will in Sections (I) to (III) show that the moral worth of actions depends on more than motivation or the agent’s character, and in (IV) I will argue that no factors other than personality traits determine the moral worth of actions. Actions can be evaluated in various respects. When we evaluate them from the moral point of view, {{we can do this}} in two very different ways.

25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not <b>morally</b> <b>wrong.</b> The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E
25|$|On the pro-terraforming {{side of the}} argument, {{there are}} those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S.

They also point out that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not <b>morally</b> <b>wrong</b> as it does not affect any other life.|$|E

O'Neill wrote in his autobiography that he also became convinced that the conflict in Vietnam was a civil war and that US involvement was <b>morally</b> <b>wrong.</b> While the decision cost O'Neill some support among older voters in his home district, he benefited from new support among students and faculty members at the many colleges and universities there. In the House of Representatives itself, O'Neill picked up the trust and support of younger House members who shared his antiwar views, and they became important friends who contributed to O'Neill's rise through the ranks in the House.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{justifications}} for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence {{in a criminal}} trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is <b>morally</b> <b>wrong</b> to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that {{the definition of a}} crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.|$|E

In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long been}} determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties.

The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E
25|$|When Birney turned eleven he {{was sent}} to Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, {{returning}} home two years later to enter a school run by a Presbyterian man that had just opened in Danville. He excelled in his studies there, which were mostly based in the sciences. In 1808, he entered the College of New Jersey at age seventeen, which was the name of Princeton University at that time. He studied political philosophy, logic and moral philosophy, and became known as a proficient debater. Among his classmates, he became particularly good friends with George M. Dallas. He studied under the president of the school (Samuel Stanhope Smith), both a logician and an author who held weak anti-slavery sentiments. He believed that slavery was <b>morally</b> <b>wrong,</b> but upheld the citizens' right of ownership. Birney graduated from Princeton on September 26, 1810.|$|E
40|$|Moral {{judgments}} and moral emotions are a ubiquitous feature of social interactions. Humans decide quickly and intuitively whether an action is <b>morally</b> right or <b>wrong.</b> Schadenfreude and sympathy, as emotional {{reactions to the}} misfortunes of others, are prototypical moral emotions. So far, however, little evidence exists concerning children’s understanding of schadenfreude. Within three studies, we investigated the experience of schadenfreude and sympathy among N = 364 children of different age groups. We interviewed the children while showing them picture stories. In the picture stories, we varied {{the behavior of the}} protagonist prior to a misfortune: (1) whether his behavior had been <b>morally</b> right or <b>wrong,</b> (2) whether the protagonist attained his goal, (3) whether the protagonist was responsible for the misfortune. In addition, in one study we varied (4) the emotional relationship of the interviewed children to the protagonist. Furthermore, we asked the children to decide whether they want to sit next to the protagonist or do him a favor. Results show that children experience sympathy as well as schadenfreude at the age of 4 years. Sympathy is more likely to arise when the protagonists of a story are likable, when these actors typically pursue morally positive goals, and if they are not responsible for their misfortune. In contrast, schadenfreude is more likely when the protagonist is disliked, when actors pursue immoral goals and if they are responsible for their misfortune. In addition, sympathy increases approach (helping behavior, sitting next to the agent and doing favors), whereas schadenfreude increases avoidance tendencies...|$|R

Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), {{there is not much}} room for people to have different views on what is <b>morally</b> right or <b>wrong.</b> The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else.|$|R
