25|$|Surviving <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> groups include: {{articulate}} brachiopods (those with a hinge), {{which have}} undergone a slow decline in numbers since the P–Tr extinction; the Ceratitida order of ammonites; and crinoids ("sea lilies"), which very nearly became extinct but later became abundant and diverse.|$|E
25|$|Marine {{invertebrates}} {{suffered the}} greatest losses during the P–Tr extinction. Evidence {{of this was}} found in samples from south China sections at the P–Tr boundary. Here, 286 out of 329 <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> genera disappear within the final 2 sedimentary zones containing conodonts from the Permian. The decrease in diversity was probably caused by {{a sharp increase in}} extinctions, rather than a decrease in speciation.|$|E
25|$|One isothiazolinone, Sea-Nine 211 (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolino-3-one, DCOI), has quickly {{replaced}} tributyltin as the {{antifouling agent}} {{of choice in}} ship hull paint. A recent study reported the presence of DCOI in both port water and sediment samples in Osaka, Japan, especially in weakly circulating mooring areas. Of environmental concern, DCOI levels predicted in marinas now are considered a threat to various <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> species. Isothiazolinones also are extremely toxic to fish.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Invertebrate</b> Collection {{was started}} in the 1930s with alcohol-preserved {{specimens}} collected by Dr. C. McLean Fraser and Dr. Ian McTaggart Cowan. The collection was primarily used for teaching purposes and eventually grew to several thousand specimens encompassing the major lineages of invertebrate animals. The collection was expanded in 2006, due to the donation of thousands of shells and corals by Kelly Norton. The collection was further expanded the following year with a large donation from Evelyn Hebb Killiam.|$|E
25|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> {{collection}} {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
25|$|The Cocinetas Basin has {{provided}} several new species and genera of vertebrates and invertebrates of which many are still studied in detail. The Uitpa, Jimol, Castilletes, and Ware Formations preserve both a diverse continental vertebrate and a rich <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fossil record that documents paleoenvironmental change through the Neogene. This succession shows a broad pattern of changing depositional environments {{associated with the}} tectonic history of the Cocinetas Basin. Paleobathymetric and paleoenvironmental analyses suggest that the lower Uitpa Formation accumulated in water depths ranging from , a deepening {{with respect to the}} underlying Siamaná Formation and leading to the collapse of coral reefs.

25|$|During the Oligocene and Early Miocene large swathes of Patagonia {{were subject}} to a marine {{transgression}}. The transgression might have temporarily linked the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as inferred from the findings of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fossils of both Atlantic and Pacific affinity in La Cascada Formation. Connection would have occurred through narrow epicontinental seaways that formed channels in a dissected topography. The Antarctic Plate started to subduct beneath South America 14 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene forming the Chile Triple Junction. At first the Antarctic Plate subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile Triple Junction was located near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate begun to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction advanced to the north over time. The asthenospheric window associated to the triple junction disturbed previous patterns of mantle convection beneath Patagonia inducing an uplift of ca. 1km that reversed the Miocene transgression.|$|E

These edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are sources of potent bioactive peptides. The {{last two decades}} have seen a surge {{of interest in the}} discovery of antioxidant peptides from edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Enzymatic hydrolysis is an efficient strategy commonly used for releasing antioxidant peptides from food proteins. A growing number of antioxidant peptide sequences have been identified from the enzymatic hydrolysates of edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Antioxidant peptides have potential applications in food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. In this review, we first give a brief overview of the current state of progress of antioxidant peptide research, with special attention to marine antioxidant peptides. We then focus on 22 investigations which identified 32 antioxidant peptides from enzymatic hydrolysates of edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Strategies adopted by various research groups in the purification and identification of the antioxidant peptides will be summarized. Structural characteristic of the peptide sequences in relation to their antioxidant activities will be reviewed.
