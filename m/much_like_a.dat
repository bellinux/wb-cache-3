5|$|A Han kingdom was <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> commandery in {{size and}} administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), {{as many of the}} early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E
5|$|An early {{design was}} for a version with a {{secondary}} hull, but {{it appeared to be}} too similar to the ship seen in The Original Series. That throwback styling had been partially inspired by Berman viewing the throwback concept in the 2002 Ford Thunderbird, itself a modern update of the original Thunderbird. Following that concept, the designers took the styling of the USS Enterprise from The Original Series and updated it, but ultimately it looked too <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> simple update to the same vessel.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and game boards <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> traditional board game. One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen. Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} primarily {{of steel and}} glass. The main building {{is based on the}} diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trailer on stilts.|$|E
5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' {{is tied to}} and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E

5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|The Angevin-Neapolitan {{influence}} of Celestine {{was evident in}} his first consistory, during which he created twelve cardinals, including seven Frenchmen and three (or five) Neapolitans. This {{was the first time}} in history where a single consistory had swung the College of Cardinals so decidedly in one nationalist partisan direction. The cardinals who were not French or Angevin were members of Celestine's former order. Celestine also moved to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, where he continued to live <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hermit until he resigned, as advocated by many Roman cardinals, including Benedetto Gaetani (who, a former lawyer, suggested that Celestine first publish a decree establishing the permissibility of papal abdication.) Gaetani, elected Pope Boniface VIII following Celestine's abdication, proceeded to have Celestine imprisoned while the legality of his abdication remained a prominent subject, and Celestine died a prisoner in 1296.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera tricks {{to realize the}} probe; {{post-production}} effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spinning basketball.|$|E
5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. Thick as a Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original Thick as a Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E
5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. <b>Much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. <b>Much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|De sacramento altaris, {{dealing with}} the eucharist and passover, is Baldwin's longest {{surviving}} work, in 12manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom that reads <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vindication of Becket's status as a martyr. It was first printed in 1662, and has more recently been edited and published in the series Sources Chrétiennes, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, De commendatione fidei, that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five {{are known to have}} existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of De commendatione fidei in 1662. The modern critical edition of De commendatione was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei. with the De commendatione fidei translated into English in 2000.|$|E
