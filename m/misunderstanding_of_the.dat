5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory has}} been rebuffed {{medically}} as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, {{are based on a}} <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.|$|E

5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E

25|$|A {{popular belief}} exists that the Inuit have {{an unusually large}} number of words for snow. This is not accurate, and results from a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of polysynthetic languages. In fact, the Inuit {{have only a few}} base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb to snow, and 'aput', which means snow as a substance. Parts of speech work very {{differently}} in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.|$|E
25|$|Contact with colonizing groups {{brought about}} a {{considerable}} transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods {{in the wake of}} interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships, with material relations being secondary.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{statistical}} approach for controlling for family environment {{as a cause of}} maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid. Spiegel stated that inferring the source of maladjustment from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and family environment does not answer the question of which variable explains maladjustment better; the authors answered that this statement shows a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistical procedure used their meta-analysis. Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for family environment.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{prominence}} as a San Francisco landmark, no {{primary source}} {{has been found}} that clearly identifies the origin of the Conservatory of Flowers. Contributing to the confusion is erroneous information, based upon <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building or a cursory review of historic documentation that has appeared in print. Some historic documentation infers that the building was imported. Since it was common for conservatories to be shipped far from the place of manufacture, one could be led to conclude that this {{was the case with the}} Conservatory of Flowers. However, there is no historic information to substantiate the importation of the structure.|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} stated by critics of evolution {{that there are}} no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight.|$|E

Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken his bald head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny, in his Naturalis Historiæ, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy {{that he would be}} killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.|$|E

25|$|Although {{originally}} developed in England in 1748 {{in order to}} compete with imported porcelain, bone china is now made worldwide. The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail. One writer has speculated that a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text could possibly {{have been responsible for}} the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of English porcelain, although this is not supported by researchers and historians. In China, kaolin was sometimes described as forming the 'bones' of the paste, while the 'flesh' was provided by the refined rocks suitable for the porcelain body. Traditionally, English bone china was made from two parts of bone-ash, one part of kaolin and one part china stone, although this has largely been replaced by feldspars from non-UK sources.|$|E
25|$|Because the Turkish {{soldiers}} understood neither English nor Korean, {{the deployment}} of the Turkish Brigade quickly ran into difficulties, {{and the lack of}} accurate intelligence on Chinese forces further added to the chaos. During their advance eastward, the Turks were forced to conduct long marches in the Korean countryside because of <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IX Corps' instructions. On 26 November 1950, a column 200 South Korean soldiers of the ROK 6th and 7th Infantry Divisions fleeing from Tokchon were attacked by a battalion of Turks who were the first to arrive at Wawon, after the Turks mistook the Koreans for Chinese. 20 South Koreans were killed and four others were injured by the Turks. The Turks suffered 14 deaths and six injuries {{as a result of an}} exchange of fire with the South Koreans.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} abbreviations, as gov’t for government. It may {{indicate}} omitted numbers where the spoken form is also capable of omissions, as ’70s for 1970s representing seventies for nineteen-seventies. In modern usage, apostrophes are generally omitted when letters are removed {{from the start of}} a word, particularly for a compound word. For example, it is not common to write ’bus (for omnibus), ’phone (telephone), ’net (Internet). However, if the shortening is unusual, dialectal or archaic, the apostrophe may still be used to mark it (e.g., ’bout for about, ’less for unless, ’twas for it was). Sometimes a <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original form of a word results in an incorrect contraction. A common example: ’til for until, though till is in fact the original form, and until is derived from it.|$|E
