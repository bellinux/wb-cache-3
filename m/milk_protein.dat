5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> content, MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Camel's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have very}} little {{homology}} with cow's <b>Milk</b> <b>proteins,</b> and, in addition, beta-lactoglobulin, the major allergenic <b>protein</b> in cow's <b>milk,</b> is completely absent in camel's milk. Such structural differences may result in different antigenic responses induced by these two milks. In the present work we studied the immunoreactivity of camel's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> using sera from children with confirmed allergy to cow's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins.</b> Methods. We used milk caseins and whey proteins from Targui camels from Southern Algeria and sera from 10 patients allergic to cow's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> confirmed by their clinical history and by skin tests. The immunoreactivity of camel's and cow's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> was studied by indirect Elisa using these sera. Results. All the 10 sera showed reactivity with cow's milk caseins whereas only 4 of them reacted with camel's milk caseins, and these responses were significantly lower (16 to 92 %) compared to the responses to cow's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins.</b> In contrast, all of the whey proteins reacted with the patients' sera, but these responses were lower than those with bovine whey proteins (36 to 85 % lower). Discussion. Camel's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> {{appear to have a}} very weak antigenic potential in comparison to cow's <b>milk</b> <b>proteins,</b> as has been reported in other studies (Restani et al., 2002; Vereda, 2006; El-Agamy et al., 2007; Fiocchi et al., 2010). Conclusion. The use of camel's milk as a substitute for cow's milk carries a certain risk due to its residual immunoreactivity. Nevertheless, due to its low allergenic potential, it could be considered {{to be used as a}} substitute for cow's milk for children at risk of developing cow's milk allergy...|$|R
30|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are often}} used as {{stabilizers}} or emulsifiers in food derivates. Some vaccines (Table  2) could contains hidden <b>milk</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{in order to prevent}} viruses degradation. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in milk and egg-allergic children after MMR vaccination [41]. Kattan JD et al. [42] have evaluated 8 pediatric patients with previous anaphylaxis arisen within 60  minutes after an acellular diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. In 6 of these children an immediate allergic reaction to <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> have been recorded, and in 5 of these the reaction was a severe one. In all children a significant sensitization to <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> have been documented within 2  years after vaccine reaction. Some researchers have observed that culture media used for commercial vaccine against Chlostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphteriae and Bordetella pertussis could have been supplemented with aminoacids derived from the hydrolysis of <b>milk</b> <b>proteins.</b> Authors have demon-strated, with an ELISA essay, a concentration between 8.1 and 18.3  ng/mL of casein peptides in 8 different batches of DTP (Diphteria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine [43]. Furthermore, hidden amounts of alpha-lactalbumin have been detected even in some oral polio vaccine (OPV) [44]. Four children, receiving OPV and measles-mumps vaccine at the same time, have shown severe systemic reactions after vaccines injections. In these children there was a previous history of <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> allergy but no egg-allergy. As well, skin prick test and serum specific IgE were positive for <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> but negative for egg proteins. Moreover, skin prick test with OPV, but not for measles-mumps vaccine, were positive.Although based on these scattered case-studies, due to the possible presence of <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> in OPV and DPT vaccine, it has been suggested, in children with history of <b>milk’s</b> <b>proteins</b> anaphylaxis, a 60  minutes observation after vaccination (Table  2) [43].|$|R

25|$|Carbohydrates are an {{important}} source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow's milk-based formulas, lactose is the main source of carbohydrates present, but lactose is not present in cow's milk-based lactose-free formulas nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> sensitivity. Lactose is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without lactose will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and glucose, dextrins, and natural and modified starches. Lactose is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, <b>milk</b> <b>protein,</b> sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

Skimmed llama <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> were first characterized by a 2 D separation technique coupling RP-HPLC in the first dimension with SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (RP-HPLC/SDS-PAGE). Llama <b>milk</b> <b>proteins,</b> namely caseins ((s 1) -, (s 2) -, -, and -caseins), -lactalbumin, lactoferrin, and serum albumin, were identified using PMF.

De novo sequencing of the llama -lactalbumin protein by LC coupled with MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) showed the occurrence of two amino acid substitutions (R 62 L/I and K 89 L/I) that partly explained the higher hydrophobicity of llama -lactalbumin compared with its dromedary counterpart.

40|$|CVD are {{the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Hypertension, a major {{controllable}} risk factor of CVD, is intimately associated with vascular dysfunction, a defect which is also now recognised to be a major, modifiable risk factor for the development of CVD. The purpose of the present review was to critically evaluate the evidence for the effects of <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> and their associated peptides on blood pressure (BP) and vascular dysfunction. After a detailed literature search, the number of human trials evaluating the antihypertensive effects of casein-derived peptides (excluding isoleucine-proline-proline and valine-proline-proline) was found to be limited; the studies were preliminary with substantial methodological limitations. Likewise, the data from human trials that examined the effects of whey protein and peptides were also scarce and inconsistent. To date, only one study has conducted a comparative investigation on the relative effects of the two main intact <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> on BP and vascular function.
