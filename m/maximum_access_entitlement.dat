Water <b>access</b> <b>entitlements,</b> allocations and trading have been key elements of recent water reforms in Australia. Achieving nationally-compatible water <b>access</b> <b>entitlements,</b> returning over-allocated systems to environmentally-sustainable levels of extraction, and removing barriers to trade in water to facilitate the broadening and deepening of the water market are all objectives of the 2004 Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative (NWI).

40|$|This report focusses on the Indigenous access {{provisions}} of the 2004 National Water Initiative (NWI). It describes the policy mechanisms and processes that have been implemented to date for Indigenous participation in water planning and access to water.  The report supplies detailed observations about these processes. A decade of water reform in Australia culminated in the 2004 National Water Initiative (NWI www. nwc. gov. au), representing the most significant change in water policy since Australian Federation in 1901. The objectives of the NWI include increasing the security of water <b>access</b> <b>entitlements</b> and ensuring the economically efficient use of water resources. These are to be achieved by altering property rights to enhance trade in water, through water planning mechanisms, including environmental flow provisions, intergovernmental coordination and intensive information systems.   The NWI explicitly recognises the special character of Indigenous interests in water. Parties to the NWI have agreed that water <b>access</b> <b>entitlements</b> and planning frameworks should recognise Indigenous needs ‘in relation to access and management’ (paragraph 25 (ix)). Indigenous access is to be achieved through planning processes that: • include Indigenous representation in water planning, wherever possible; • incorporate Indigenous social, spiritual and customary objectives and strategies for achieving these objectives, wherever they can be developed; • {{take account of the}} possible existence of native title rights to water in the catchment or aquifer area; • potentially allocate water to native title holders; and  • account for any water allocated to native title holders for ‘traditional cultural purposes’ (paragraphs 52 – 54). Given low levels of awareness of water reform within the Indigenous sector, elements of the NWI relating to community partnerships, knowledge and capacity building are also of considerable importance...|$|R

The delivery of cloud computing service according to above mentioned implementations enables reduced setup times for the deployments of outsourced business computing solutions, with little or no requirement being imposed on the customers to understand and manage the underlying technologies operating in the infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The {{first time}} that water <b>access</b> <b>entitlements</b> were {{separated}} from land title in Australia was in 1983, when South Australia introduced a permanent water trading scheme. Like many other countries, Australia’s irrigation sector was subject to centralised control {{for more than a}} century. Many irrigation settlements were placed in inappropriate parts of the landscape where the risks of waterlogging, land salinisation or river salinisation were high and returns from production were low. Farm sizes on irrigated settlements were also initially based on non-commercial criteria like ‘the home maintenance area’ (the maximum area necessary to support one family - as judged by government). Irrigators were in this way condemned to a frugal existence from the start. Changing commodity markets and above all changing irrigation technologies amplified these initial errors and left Australian irrigation with difficult adjustment problems.|$|R

40|$|In this Series paper, {{we examine}} whether well {{functioning}} civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems {{are associated with}} improved population health outcomes. We present a conceptual model connecting CRVS to wellbeing, and describe an ecological association between CRVS and health outcomes. The conceptual model posits that the legal identity that civil registration provides to individuals is key to <b>access</b> <b>entitlements</b> and services. Vital statistics produced by CRVS systems provide essential information for public health policy and prevention. These outcomes benefit individuals and societies, including improved health. We use marginal linear models and lag-lead analysis to measure ecological associations between a composite metric of CRVS performance and three health outcomes. Results {{are consistent with the}} conceptual model: improved CRVS performance coincides with improved health outcomes worldwide in a temporally consistent manner. Investment to strengthen CRVS systems is not only an important goal for individuals and societies, but also a development imperative that is good for health. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
50|$|The Analog Protection System (APS), {{also known}} as Copyguard, is a DVD copy {{prevention}} system originally developed by Macrovision. Video tapes copied from DVDs encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the AGC circuit of a recording device. In digital devices changes to the analog video signal are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device. In DVD players trigger bits are created during DVD authoring to inform the APS {{that it should be}} applied to DVD players analog outputs or analog video outputs on a PC while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In set top boxes trigger bits are incorporated into Conditional <b>Access</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Control Messages (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB. In VHS alterations to the analog video signal are added in a Macrovision-provided “processor box” used by duplicators.|$|R
