25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (<b>Millennium</b> <b>Edition),</b> {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, 2000, a {{judgment}} was handed {{down in the}} case of United States v. Microsoft Corp., calling the company an [...] "abusive monopoly" [...] and forcing the company to split into two separate units. Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court, and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, Windows CE 3.0. The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the WinAPI, the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, Windows ME (or Windows <b>Millennium</b> <b>Edition),</b> was released on September 14, 2000. It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often {{regarded as one of the}} worst versions of Windows due to stability problems, restricted real mode DOS support and other issues.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Norgaard is {{the author}} of one book, {{co-author}} or editor of three additional books, and has over 100 other publications spanning the fields of environment and development, tropical forestry and agriculture, environmental epistemology, energy economics, and ecological economics. Although his research scholarship has been an eclectic mix of sociology, economics, philosophy, and the natural sciences, and he is well known for his iconoclast perspectives of conventional economics, stemming from a strong commitment to inter-disciplinarity and social justice, Professor Norgaard is also among the 1000 economists in the world most cited by other economists (<b>Millennium</b> <b>Editions</b> of Who's Who in Economics, 2000) and was one of ten American economists interviewed in The Changing Face of Economics: Conversations with Cutting Edge Economists (Colander, Holt, and Rosser, University of Michigan Press, 2004).|$|R
40|$|As {{could be}} read in the Indian {{newspaper}} MP Chronicle in November 1999, the word 'Bollywood', sobriquet for the glamorous Indian film industry in Bombay, will be among several new entries of Indian origin (like bindi or mehndi) to be included into the <b>millennium</b> <b>editions</b> of famous British dictionaries. Bombay has been the centre of India's film industry since 1895, when the films of the Lumiere brothers were shown in the Watson's Hotel. Although there are studios in other Indian cities where films in various languages and dialects are produced (e. g. Telugu films in Hyderabad or Tamil films in Madras), Bollywood clearly remains the most important centre {{for the production of}} Hindi films. Many Bollywood actors are Muslim - as are important composers and lyricists - and it is therefore interesting to investigate the biographies of these stars...|$|R
