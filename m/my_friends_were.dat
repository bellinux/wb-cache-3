25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I and <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> all {{very worried about}} what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

She is a twice winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry.

500|$|Hill {{attended}} Fullerton College in {{the late}} 1970s, {{but she did not}} have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976–78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as [...] "a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies". As Hill describes it, climbing {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was [...] "something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists". As she had earlier, Hill worked {{in order to be able}} to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers [...] "these dirt-poor days... among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, and named Rickey Nelson Henley, named after singer-actor Ricky Nelson, to John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley on Christmas Day, 1958, in Chicago, {{in the back seat}} of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, [...] "I was already fast. I couldn't wait." [...] When he was two years old, his father left home, and his family moved to Oakland, California, when he was seven. His father died in an {{automobile}} accident ten years after leaving home. His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower — a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so. [...] Henderson later said, [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutting {{ordered an}} initial {{production}} run of 1,500 units of Computer Space, an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade {{game at the}} time would sell around 2,000 units, though a handful had reached 10,000. Reception to the game from distributors was mixed; while some were excited by the game, others felt it to be confusing {{and part of a}} passing video game fad. By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1,000 units, and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1,300 and 1,500 units. While this was a commercial success, making over US$1,000,000, it was a disappointment to Nutting, who had been hoping for a large-scale success like Computer Quiz. The game's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve, which pushed away customers used to less complex games. Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in, like the Dutch Goose playtest location, were generally located near university campuses; the general market for coin-operated games, however, was in working-class bars, where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game. In the documentary Video Game Invasion: The History of a Global Obsession, Bushnell explained, [...] "Sure, I loved it, and all my friends loved it, but all <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> engineers. It was a little too complicated for the guy with the beer in the bar." [...] Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game; he has said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then. Conversely, Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game's novelty was also part of its appeal to players—most people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it, rather than playing video from a remote television station.|$|E

2500|$|While the top animators like Tytla and Babbit {{were highly}} paid, {{they were all}} too aware of the low wages being paid to assistants and {{production}} people. Babbit even {{went as far as}} paying his assistant out of his own pocket. But in early 1941 Babbitt was fired for union activities. The day after Babbit led over 300 Disney studio employees in a strike, demanding union representation. To Disney's surprise and dismay, Tytla joined the strike line. [...] "I was for the company union, and I went on strike because <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> on strike," [...] said Tytla. [...] "I was sympathetic with their views, but I never wanted to do anything against Walt." [...] The strike lasted over two months and was so divisive that it profoundly altered the course of American character animation. As the strike ended, America entered World War II and the Golden age was effectively over.|$|E
2500|$|At age 13, Parker met fellow Tame Impala member Dominic Simper {{in their}} high school music class, whom he found a musical {{connection}} with. Parker and Simper started off playing covers of Rage Against the Machine, Unwritten Law, Sunk Loto and Korn songs, along with Dan Debuf, {{who is now a}} presenter on 2Day FM. In his late-teens, Parker discovered the many '60s and '70s psychedelic rock artists that would have a huge influence on his music, saying that [...] "I got into bands like Cream and Jefferson Airplane in a big way, and loved the sound of their recordings. <b>My</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> listening to bands like Brainticket and Demon Fuzz who opened my eyes to different ways of constructing songs. The Beatles way of singing vocal lines often crept into the recordings because they are so unique, whereas the elements we take from those other bands are usually common among a few other bands we listen to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fox {{has spoken}} {{extensively}} {{of her time}} in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being [...] "pelted with ketchup packets". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had [...] "always gotten along better with boys" [...] and that [...] "rubbed some people the wrong way". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that [...] "everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn’t like me for that. I’ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life".

2500|$|Loyalties to the {{two teams}} divided friends, families, and co-workers, and shaped the locals in various ways, as George Will noted in a 1998 {{commencement}} address at Washington University in St. Louis: [...] "I grew up in Champaign, Illinois, midway between Chicago and St. Louis. At an age too tender for life-shaping decisions, I made one. While all <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> becoming Cardinals fans, I became a Cub fan. My friends, happily rooting for Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst, and other great Redbirds, grew up cheerfully convinced {{that the world is}} a benign place, so of course, they became liberals. Rooting for the Cubs in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I became gloomy, pessimistic, morose, dyspeptic and conservative. It helped out of course that the Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, which is two years before Mark Twain and Tolstoy died. But that means, class of 1998, that the Cubs are in the 89th year of their rebuilding effort, and remember, any team can have a bad moment." ...|$|E

The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and things of that sort.
