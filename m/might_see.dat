5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly <b>might</b> <b>see</b> them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child <b>might</b> <b>see</b> a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man <b>might</b> <b>see</b> them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England <b>might</b> <b>see</b> an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
25|$|In the US, smokers and {{hospitality}} businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from no-smoking laws. However, a 2006 {{review by the}} U.S. Surgeon General found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars <b>might</b> <b>see</b> increased business.|$|E
25|$|Most widely {{distributed}} American crosswords today (e.g., The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, USA Today, etc.) also contain colloquial answers, i.e., {{entries in the}} puzzle grid that try to replicate everyday colloquial language. In such a puzzle one <b>might</b> <b>see</b> phrases such as WHAT'S UP, AS IF, or WHADDYA WANT.|$|E

50|$|Historical trauma, and its manifestations, are {{an example}} of transgenerational trauma. For example, a pattern of {{maternal}} {{abandonment of a child}} <b>might</b> be <b>seen</b> across three generations, or the actions of an abusive parents <b>might</b> be <b>seen</b> in continued abuse across generations. These manifestations can also stem from the trauma of events, such as the witnessing of war, genocide or death.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{during the time of}} the Temple in Jerusalem, all the walls of the Temple were high except the eastern wall. This was so that the priest who burned the Red Cow, while {{standing}} on the top of the Mount of Olives, <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the door of the main Temple building when he sprinkled the blood.|$|E
25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias, or hostile {{attribution of}} intent, is {{the tendency to}} interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign. For example, a person {{with high levels of}} hostile attribution bias <b>might</b> <b>see</b> two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.|$|E
25|$|Pericutaneous space: The space {{just outside}} our bodies but {{which might be}} near to {{touching}} it. Visual-tactile perceptive fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual <b>might</b> <b>see</b> a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{some states}} are {{beginning}} to go Beyond Aid and instead seek to ensure there is a policy coherence, for example see Common Agricultural Policy reform or Doha Development Round. This approach <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the nature of aid change from loans, debt cancellation, budget support etc., to supporting developing countries. This requires a strong political will, however, the results could potentially make aid far more effective and efficient.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} some {{relatively}} pristine objects, such as you <b>might</b> <b>see</b> in the Louvre or the British Museum, {{the vast majority of}} recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the intense {{arrangement}} of the song owes much to their desire to be the most memorable band on the multi-act tours of the U.K. they were booked on in the early days. The repeating guitar riff and Burdon's screaming vocals did seem to ensure that of all the bands a crowd <b>might</b> <b>see,</b> the Animals were the group that people couldn't stop talking about and the song the one they couldn't get out of their heads.|$|E

25|$|Both {{sections}} of Shikellamy State Park have a hiking trail. At the overlook {{there is a}} one-mile (1.6km) nature trail. Careful hikers will {{get the chance to}} observe some wildlife. They <b>might</b> <b>see</b> white-tail deer, many different songbirds and a wide variety of wildflowers. Hikers can also observe the development of forests at the overlook. The forest changes from scrub forest to mature hardwood forest. The marina is encircled by paved walking paths for those interested in taking a walk along the river and marina.|$|E
25|$|Video game {{development}} and authorship, much {{like any other}} form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. Video game developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include programmers and graphic designers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one <b>might</b> <b>see</b> prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the game designer. All of these are managed by producers.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you <b>might</b> <b>see</b> when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins {{and you may be}} lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E

25|$|Mélisande is at {{the tower}} window, singing a song (Mes longs cheveux) as she combs her hair. Pelléas appears and asks her to lean out so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down {{from the window and}} he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande's hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests that someone <b>might</b> <b>see</b> them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud's {{footsteps}} approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.|$|E
25|$|These {{limitations}} {{were made}} clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success {{rates on the}} order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was {{due to the fact that}} pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the target's engine and send the growling signal that indicated lock-on, but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail.|$|E
25|$|As a cricket writer, he {{generally}} concentrated on {{bringing out the}} character of the players that he was writing about, and he made liberal use of humour. In these characteristics, and in that his cricket memories went back as far as {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, he might be compared with Neville Cardus, though Thomson was writing from a Yorkshire rather than a Lancashire perspective. He once said that cricket had given him more unalloyed pleasure over a longer period than anything else, and that pleasure was evident in his writing. Thomson saw cricket not only as the most pleasurable of pastimes but also quite like the Poet Laureate <b>might</b> <b>see</b> it—an eternally vibrant display of colour, spirit, humour and conflict.|$|E
