25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} docetaxel is exerted by promoting and stabilising microtubule assembly, while preventing physiological microtubule depolymerisation/disassembly {{in the absence}} of GTP. This leads to a significant decrease in free tubulin, needed for microtubule formation and results in inhibition of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> division between metaphase and anaphase, preventing further cancer cell progeny.|$|E
25|$|Amon's {{more recent}} work has {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} chromosome segregation and how chromosomes are accurately transmitted to gametes in meiosis by examining gene regulatory networks.

25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{proteins}} {{or activities}} {{are present in}} <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> but not in interphase cells. These proteins may be synthesized or activated, or both, just prior to mitosis and {{are responsible for the}} breakdown of the nuclear envelope and the condensation of chromosomes. To learn more about the nature of these proteins, we raised monoclonal antibodies to <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells.</b> Spleen cells from mice immunized with a 0. 15 M NaCl extract of synchronized <b>mitotic</b> HeLa <b>cells</b> were fused with SP 2 / 0 -Ag 14 mouse myeloma cells, and hybrids were selected in medium containing hypoxanthine, methotrexate, thymidine, and glycine. Two different hybridoma clones secreting antibodies reactive with <b>mitotic</b> and meiotic <b>cells</b> from every species tested were isolated. Chromosomes as well as cytoplasm in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> reacted with the antibodies, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The proteins from <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> were separated by electrophoresis in NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide slab gels, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and stained immunochemically. The two antibodies, designated MPM- 1 and MPM- 2, recognize a family of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 0. 40 to greater than 200 kilodaltons (kDa). Both antibodies reacted strongly with three polypeptide bands of 182 kDa, 118 kDa, and 70 kDa. Only <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited the protein bands that were recognized by the antibodies.

40|$|Clathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} (CME) is {{the major}} internalisation route for many different receptor types in mammalian cells. CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells,</b> membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged {{in the formation of}} a rigid cortex in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be 'restarted' in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown...|$|R
500|$|The role of {{specific}} residues in the L5 pocket (L5, α2, and α3) in human Kinesin-5 has been tested, {{but not yet}} been systematically explored. The initial goal of these mutation experiments was to determine which residues had greatest pharmacological importance in drug development. [...] For example, mutations in the KIF11 gene convey resistance of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> lines to inhibitors such as monastrol and STLC. For example, point mutations in the inhibitor binding pocket, R119A, D130A, L132A, I136A, L214A and E215A confer resistance to monastrol, while R119A, D130A and L214A mutations confer resistance to STLC. [...] In contrast to the loss-of-function experiments, a gain-of-function experiment using Drosophila Kinesin-5 showed that all L5-directed inhibitors do not allosterically communicate {{in the same way}} within the Kinesin-5 motor domain.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{forms of}} yeast cells can survive and grow: haploid and diploid. The haploid cells undergo a simple {{lifecycle}} of mitosis and growth, and {{under conditions of}} high stress will, in general, die. This is the asexual form of the fungus. The diploid cells (the preferential 'form' of yeast) similarly undergo a simple lifecycle of mitosis and growth. The {{rate at which the}} <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> cycle progresses often differs substantially between haploid and diploid cells. Under conditions of stress, diploid cells can undergo sporulation, entering meiosis and producing four haploid spores, which can subsequently mate. This is the sexual form of the fungus. Under optimal conditions, yeast cells can double their population every [...] 100minutes. However, growth rates vary enormously both between strains and between environments. Mean replicative lifespan is about 26cell divisions.|$|E

The mitotic index falls from 2. 32 % at 6 months to 1. 19 % at 18 months before rising to 2. 37 % at 28 months. The variation in the mitotic index prevents the number of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> decreasing between 22 and 28 months along with decreasing cellularity.

40|$|Centrosome overduplication or {{amplification}} {{has been}} observed in many human cancers and in premalignant tissue, but the mechanisms leading to such centrosome aberrations are not fully understood. We previously showed that abnormal <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> with supernumerary centrosomes increase with replicative senescence in human fibroblasts, especially in a polyploid subpopulation. This study examines localization of p 53 protein at centrosomes in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells,</b> which is often observed in association with DNA damage response, to investigate a possible association between p 53 localization and numerical centrosome aberrations induced by cellular senescence. Cultures at later passages or the 4 th day after exposure to H 2 O 2 showed increased frequencies of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> with supernumerary centrosomes, especially in a polyploid subpopulation. Immunohistochemical analysis frequently showed p 53 -positive foci in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells,</b> and some were localized at centrosomes. The number of p 53 -positive foci in <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> and its localization to centrosomes increased with replicative and premature senescence. Supernumerary centrosomes showed higher frequencies of p 53 localization compared to normally duplicated centrosomes. Centrosome-associated p 53 protein was phosphorylated at Ser 15. These data suggest a possible association between localization of p 53 protein and numerical centrosome aberrations in replicatively or prematurely senescent cells...|$|R
2500|$|During the {{synthesis}} phase (S phase) {{in the cell}} cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just {{at the beginning of}} mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a [...] "minus"(-) end [...] relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a [...] "plus"(+) end [...] enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, {{in such a way that}} chromosomes are now bi-oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.|$|E

40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} (IIF) imaging is {{the recommended}} laboratory technique to detect autoantibodies in patient serum, but it suffers from several issues limiting its reliability and reproducibility. IIF slides are observed by specialists at the fluorescence microscope, reporting fluorescence intensity and staining pattern {{and looking for}} <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells.</b> Indeed, the presence of such cells is a key factor to assess the correctness of slide preparation process and the reported staining pattern. Therefore, the ability to detect <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> is needed to develop a complete computeraided-diagnosis system in IIF, which can support the specialists from image acquisition up to image classification. Although recent research in IIF has been directed to image acquisition, image segmentation, fluorescence intensity classification and staining pattern recognition, no works presented methods suited to classify such cells. Hence, this paper presents an heterogeneous set of features {{used to describe the}} peculiarities of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> and then tests five classifiers, belonging to different classification paradigms. The approach has been evaluated on an annotated dataset of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells.</b> The measured performances are promising, achieving a classification accuracy of 86. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|During a {{study on}} the mTor pathway in the rat kidney we {{observed}} a striking increase of the phosphorylation of the S 6 kinase in mitosis. In cryostat sections of perfusion-fixed tissue <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> appeared as bright spots in immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for the phosphorylation site Thr 421 /Ser 424. They were easily spotted in overviews with the objective 4 × and 10 ×. Immunofluorescence was weak during the interphase. During the prophase it increased in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and it remained bright during the subsequent phases of mitosis. All <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> which were found in tubules and in the interstitium of the kidney using a chromatin stain displayed the bright immunofluorescence for phospho-S 6 kinase. The same phenomenon was observed in rat liver and in mouse kidney as well as in a human cell line.

This is the first report of phosphorylation of S 6 kinase during mitosis in vivo. Thus, immunohistochemistry with anti-phospho-S 6 kinase (Thr 421 /Ser 424) appears to provide a convenient way to detect <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> at low magnification...|$|R

50|$|Several hours {{prior to}} {{harvesting}} the cultured cells, colcemid {{is added to}} the culture medium.

40|$|<b>Mitotic</b> Hep- 2 <b>cells,</b> {{selected}} by the PEL (colloidal silica) density gradient method and held in mitosis with Colcemid, are readily infected by poliovirus type I (Mahoney).

This supports the view that lysosomal enzyme redistribution is associated with the cytopathic effect in poliovirus infection but shows that virus synthesis and release is not dependent on either the cytopathic effect or lysosomal enzyme release.

40|$|Global mRNA {{translation}} is transiently inhibited during cellular division. We demonstrate that <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> contain heavy polysomes, {{but these are}} significantly less translationally active than polysomes in cycling cells. Several observations indicate that mitotic translational attenuation occurs during the elongation stage: (i) in cycling nonsynchronized cultures, only <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> fail to assemble stress granules when treated with agents that inhibit translational initiation; (ii) <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> contain fewer free 80 S complexes, which are less sensitive to high salt disassembly; (iii) mitotic polysomes are more resistant to enforced disassembly using puromycin; and (iv) ribosome transit time increases during mitosis. Elongation slowdown guarantees that polysomes are retained even if initiation is inhibited at the same time. Stalling translating ribosomes during mitosis may protect mRNAs and allow rapid resumption of translation immediately upon entry into the G 1 phase...|$|R

5000|$|Mitosis occurs only in {{eukaryotic}} cells. Prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, divide by {{a different}} process called binary fission. Mitosis varies between organisms.
