50|$|In Southeast Asia, the <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> {{project at}} Pailin, on the Kampuchea-Thai border, {{demonstrated}} how drug resistance can develop {{when a large}} population of P. falciparum undergoing high transmission rates is exposed to intense drug pressure. The project was launched in 1960 and covered a population of approximately 20,000. Sea salt was mixed with pyrimethamine at a concentration of 0.05%. Between 1960 and 1961, 77 tons of <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> were distributed in the area. After widespread pyrimethamine resistance was reported, pyrimethamine was replaced by chloroquine. From 1961 to 1962, 75 tons of chloroquine were distributed. In two indicator districts, the parasite rates decreased from 40% to 7% and from 27% to 14%. Chloroquine resistant P.falciparum isolates were first detected in Pailin in 1962 which appeared to be widespread by 1966. However no survey was undertaken to document the prevalence in the area. The factors leading to the emergence and spread of drug resistance {{appear to have been}} the continuous introduction of non-immune migrants, attracted by the promise of quick wealth from mining of precious stones, and prolonged drug pressure resulting from individual drug consumption and mass drug administration. Unrelated to MDAs the emergence of artemisinin resistant P.falciparum strains was reported in Pailin in 2008, this may have been related to overuse of artemisinin derivateves including counterfeit drugs but was not related to programmatic MDAs.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to indirect MDA, emergence of drug resistance {{has not been}} linked to the administration of therapeutic doses of antimalarials through direct MDA programmes. The likely explanation lies in the different pharmacokinetic profiles that result from these two methods of drug administration. The administration of therapeutically dosed antimalarial drugs results in a single peak drug level which kills all susceptible strains. Only during the terminal half life of the drug when the concentration drops below the Cmin, the inhibitory concentration which kills the large majority of a parasite population, will new infections with more resistant strains have a survival advantage. Thus drugs with a very short terminal half-life, including artemisinin derivatives, carry a lower risk of selecting resistant parasites than longer acting drugs. In contrast, the administration of medicated salts is likely to result in drug levels undulating in the sub-lethal range, which reach a steady state after several doses have been administered. The situation is worse if drugs such as chloroquine are used which accumulate progressively. This situation, a steady increase in drug concentration, is identical to the experimental design used for the in vitro induction of drug resistance. <b>Medicated</b> <b>salt</b> projects can be considered as large scale in vivo experiments designed to select resistant parasites.|$|E
50|$|The present unpopularity of MDA is {{not only}} due to doubts {{regarding}} the health benefit of this intervention but to the fear that MDAs will facilitate the spread of drug resistance. Concern that MDA would cause pyrimethamine and later chloroquine resistance was first raised in the early 1960s. Circumstantial evidence linked the use of <b>medicated</b> <b>salts</b> {{to the emergence of}} chloroquine resistance in the 1980s: Chloroquine resistance emerged first in three foci, namely South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil), Southeast Asia (Thailand/Kampuchea), and Africa (Tanzania/Kenya). Payne has argued that the one common factor between these three epidemiologically diverse areas was widespread distribution of <b>medicated</b> <b>salts</b> prior to the emergence of chloroquine resistance.|$|R
40|$|Several African {{countries}} have begun using amodiaquine-containing combinations as first-line antimalarial treatment, {{with the result}} that a substantial number of pregnant women are likely to be exposed to amodiaquine. However, little information is available on amodiaquine safety and efficacy during pregnancy. Between 1948 and 1990 only six published studies reported amodiaquine use in pregnancy. Only one publication mentioned adverse events, without details. Six additional studies on amodiaquine delivered by mass drug administration or <b>medicated</b> <b>salts</b> gave very little information on amodiaquine safety. Therefore, there is an urgent need for studies on amodiaquine safety and tolerability during pregnancy since current data are not sufficient to recommend its use during pregnancy, particularly as intermittent preventive treatment...|$|R
50|$|In 1959, the WHO {{conducted}} {{a trial in}} West New Guinea (later known as Irian Jaya). Salt crystals were mixed with pyrimethamine so as to provide a 0.07% pyrimethamine salt. As there were no shops in the catchment area, each family unit received fortnightly a quantity of salt from the local teacher or {{another member of the}} village community. Within three and a half months of the onset of the campaign, clinically significant levels of pyrimethamine resistance were reported. It was then decided to mix the remaining stock of pyrimethaminized salt with chloroquine powder. The chloroquine base content was 0.04% or 140 mg per adult per week based on a 5g per day salt consumption. The emergence of chloroquine resistance was investigated, but this was not detected. The distribution of <b>medicated</b> <b>salts</b> otherwise had no effect and it was concluded that ‘Pinotti’s method holds no prospect of malaria eradication…’. The explanation for this finding given by the author is that ‘the salt consumption by children was too small to reduce significantly the parasite reservoir of the younger age groups’.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1940s, {{there were}} four to six million malaria cases a year among 45 million Brazilians, with over half of cases {{occurring}} outside of the Amazon basin. The São Paulo State Antimalarial Service, the Special Public Health Service in the Amazon (SESP) and the National Malaria Service (SNM) were the three Brazilian organizations involved in malaria control. The SNM was created in 1941 and was run by Mario Pinotti starting in 1942. In 1956, Pinotti became {{the director of the}} newly created National Department for Rural Endemic Diseases, a department in the Ministry of Health that centralized public health activities against many endemic diseases including malaria, yellow fever and Chagas disease. In response to the 1955 WHO establishment of the Global Malaria Eradication Program, in 1957 Pinotti changed the National Malaria Service into the Malaria Eradication Campaign (CEM).Pinotti introduced the strategy of putting chloroquine into common cooking salt as a way of distributing the drug as a prophylactic on a wide scale. Using either chloroquine or pyrimethamine, Pinotti's <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> program proved effective, and became known as [...] "Pinotti's method". After early 1950s trials, Pinotti's salt was widely distributed in Brazil, subsequently, it was employed in South America as well as parts of Africa and Asia.|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization {{has called}} for an effort to {{eliminate}} Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) around the world. In regions where the disease is endemic, local production and distribution of <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> dosed with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been an effective method for eradicating LF. A partner of the Notre Dame Haiti program, Group SPES in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, produces a <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> called Bon Sel. Coarse salt is pre-washed and sprayed with a solution of DEC citrate and potassium iodate. Iodine levels are routinely monitored on site by a titrimetric method. However, the factory had no method for monitoring DEC. Critical analytical issues include 1) determining whether the amount of DEC in each lot of Bon Sel is within safe and therapeutically useful limits, 2) monitoring variability within and between production runs, and 3) determining {{the effect of a}} common local practice (washing salt before use) on the availability of DEC. This paper describes a novel titrimetric method for analysis of DEC citrate in <b>medicated</b> <b>salt.</b> The analysis needs no electrical power and requires only a balance, volumetric glassware, and burets that most salt production programs have on hand for monitoring iodine levels. The staff of the factory used this analysis method on site to detect underloading of DEC on the salt by their sprayer and to test a process change that fixed the problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comThe emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to widely used antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) has made malaria control and treatment much more difficult. This is particularly dramatic for Africa, as few affordable alternatives are available. Drug pressure {{has been identified as}} one of the key factors for the emergence and spread of resistance. The contribution of the extensive use and misuse of antimalarial drugs to the selection of resistant parasites became particularly evident during the Global Malaria Eradication campaign, launched by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1955. The first reports confirming P. falciparum resistance to CQ came almost simultaneously in the early 1960 s from South America and South-East Asia, where direct or indirect (through use of <b>medicated</b> cooking <b>salt)</b> mass drug administration (MDA) had been implemented. Similar approaches were very limited in Africa, where P. falciparum resistance to CQ was first reported from the eastern region in the late 1970 s and spread progressively west. Most African countries still rely heavily on CQ as first-line treatment despite various levels of resistance, although some states have changed to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first-line drug. Unfortunately, the predicted SP useful therapeutic life might be very short, probably because of its prolonged half-life, causing a higher probability of selecting resistant strains and a consequent fast development of resistance. CQ resistance is not evenly distributed and important differences can be found within and between countries. It seems to have spread more rapidly in East than in West Africa. Considering the high level of CQ use in West Africa, other factors such as intensity of transmission, population immunity or population movements should be considered when explaining the different levels of resistance. Understanding such factors may help us in devising strategies to contain the spread of drug resistance...|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{sensitivity}} and incipient resistance of Plasmodium falciparum strains to chloroquine {{have been reported}} from Mto-wa-Mbu, in the north-east of the United Republic of Tanzania. In this locality the population {{had been exposed to}} chloroquine pressure for about two decades, in the form of <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> and through easy availability of the drug itself. In an attempt to find out whether such chemosuppression had influenced the immune response of the population, two seroepidemiological surveys were carried out in March 1981 and March 1982; the second survey was performed to confirm the results obtained in the first one. The humoral immunological response was measured by the immunofluorescent antibody technique. In the absence of information on the immunological profile that existed in the area prior to the introduction of chloroquine in 1960, {{the results of the present}} surveys were compared with those obtained in another locality in the north-east of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1967, and in the West Kiang district of Gambia in 1965. The two areas used for comparison exhibited a malaria endemicity similar to that prevailing in Mto-wa-Mbu prior to the introduction of the <b>medicated</b> <b>salt.</b> The results from Mto-wa-Mbu showed a significantly lower proportion of subjects with positive titres and a lower geometric mean titre in all age groups...|$|E
40|$|DEC (diethylcarbamazine) -medicated salt, at a {{concentration}} of 0. 1 to 0. 2 mg per 100 mg, {{was given to the}} entire population of Karaikal (119 978) in South India for a 4 -year period from 1982. The per capita consumption of DEC in <b>medicated</b> <b>salt</b> was 13. 3 grams for the entire period. The prevalence of microfilaraemia declined significantly from 4. 5 % in 1982 to 0. 14 % in 1985 and 0. 4 % in 1993. Vector infection declined from 0. 6 % in 1982 to zero after two years. The mechanism of preparation and regulated distribution of DEC-medicated salt in the locality is presented. Long-term follow-up suggests that DEC-medicated salt distribution is cheap, safe and efficient for the elimination of filariasis...|$|E
