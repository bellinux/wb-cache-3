30|$|In some DER {{connected}} distribution systems, {{the backup}} relays may operate after {{long time delay}} and this may result inadequate protection in case when primary relays fails to trip. In [112], the bidirectional fault flow is utilised for tripping of near end <b>reverse</b> <b>relays</b> as backup relay. This protection coordination scheme is achieved by dual relay setting for each relay. One set of relay settings will work for forward fault current direction and other will work for the reverse direction of fault current. The implementation of protection scheme using dual relay setting is not yet reported.|$|R
5000|$|Märklin three-rail trains use a short spike of DC voltage to <b>reverse</b> a <b>relay</b> {{within the}} {{locomotive}} {{while it is}} stopped. Märklin's track {{does not have an}} actual third rail; instead, a series of short pins provide the current, taken up by a long [...] "shoe" [...] under the engine. This shoe is long enough to always be in contact with several pins. This is known as the stud contact system and has certain advantages when used on outdoor model railway systems. The ski collector rubs over the studs and thus inherently self cleans. When both track rails are used for the return in parallel there is much less chance of current interruption due to dirt on the line.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Overcurrent relays {{are widely}} used for {{protection}} of power systems, directional ones for transmission side, and non-directional ones for distribution side. The fault direction may be forward (between relay and grid), or <b>reverse</b> (between <b>relay</b> and source), the normal power flow being from source to the grid. Known directional overcurrent relays rely on a reference voltage phasor for estimating {{the direction of the}} fault, requiring both current and voltage sensors. This increases the cost of the relays, prohibiting the utilization of such relays in the distribution side protection and automation, {{which is going to be}} a key part in the smart grid initiative. In this paper, a novel current-only directional detection possibility is highlighted.

40|$|Modeling {{tools are}} useful for basic {{understanding}} of power system, particularly for new engineers. Such tools help the new engineers to modulate the system under normal and faulty conditions. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of digital <b>reverse</b> power <b>relay</b> on MATLAB/Simulink®. Various data conversion steps in digitization of a signal are also discussed. In the past, electromechanical relays were commonly used, now such relays have been replaced with high accuracy and high speed digital relays. Fast operation of relay is desirable, particularly for such type of faults {{which could lead to}} system blackout. Digital relays offer other advantages also, in term of multiple variable settings and compact size. In this paper, the relay performance is tested on 11 kV synchronous generator, connected with 220 kV through a step up transformer...|$|R

50|$|In recent years, large {{units of}} a utility power station are usually {{designed}} on a unit system basis {{in which the}} required devices, including the boiler, the turbine generator unit, and its power (step up) and unit (auxiliary) transformer are solidly connected as one unit. A less common set-up consists of two units grouped together with one common station auxiliary. As each turbine generator unit has its own attached unit auxiliary transformer, it {{is connected to the}} circuit automatically. For starting the unit, the auxiliaries are supplied with power by another unit (auxiliary) transformer or station auxiliary transformer. The period of switching from the first unit transformer to the next unit is designed for automatic, instantaneous operation in times when the emergency power system needs to kick in. It is imperative that the power to unit auxiliaries not fail during a station shutdown (an occurrence known as black-out when all regular units temporarily fail). Instead, during shutdowns the grid is expected to remain operational. When problems occur, it is usually due to <b>reverse</b> power <b>relays</b> and frequency-operated relays on grid lines due to severe grid disturbances. Under these circumstances, the emergency station supply must kick in to avoid damage to any equipment and to prevent hazardous situations such as the release of hydrogen gas from generators to the local environment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{undrained}} {{shear strength}} (su) of fine-grained soils that {{can be measured in}} situ and in laboratory {{is one of the key}} geotechnical parameters. The unconfined compression test (UCT) is widely used in laboratory to measure this parameter due to its simplicity; however, it is severely affected by sample disturbance. The vane shear test (VST) technique that is less sensitive to sample disturbance involves a correction factor against the soil plasticity, commonly known as the Bjerrum's correction factor, μ. This study aims to reevaluate the Bjerrum's correction factor in consideration of a different approach and a relatively new method of testing. Atterberg limits test, <b>miniature</b> VST, and <b>reverse</b> extrusion test (RET) were conducted on 120 remolded samples. The effect of soil plasticity on {{undrained shear strength}} was examined using the liquidity index instead of Bjerrum's correction factor. In comparison with the result obatined using the Bjerrum's correction factor, the undrained shear strength was better represented when su values were correlated with the liquidity index. The results were validated by the RET, which was proven to take into account soil plasticity with a reliable degree of accuracy. This study also shows that the RET has strong promise as a new tool for testing undrained shear strength of fine-grained soils...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, <b>reverse</b> current <b>relays</b> prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
