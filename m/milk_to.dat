5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.|$|E
5|$|Usually very {{inquisitive}} {{and friendly}} birds, they will often invade a campsite, searching for edible items, including fruit, insects, and remnants from containers of jam or honey, and milk is particularly favoured. Parent birds feed the young on insects, fruit and nectar, {{and have been}} recorded regurgitating <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> them as well.|$|E
50|$|These {{authorities}} also permitted <b>milking</b> <b>to</b> waste using automated machines, but the Chazon Ish {{wrote that}} it was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>milk</b> the first few drops to waste using automated machines, followed by switching to containers and collecting the remaining milk in the containers. However, in practice, the Chazon Ish permitted farmers to adopt this practice to prevent economic loss because the action of milking for collection was indirect. Using a device invented by the Zomet Institute in the 1980s, which allowed the switch from <b>milking</b> <b>to</b> waste <b>to</b> <b>milking</b> into containers <b>to</b> occur indirectly without human intervention, the act of milking cows became more indirect and thus more likely to be permitted. Yet another solution, whereby the cows are hooked up to the machine with electricity off, and the electricity is soon turned on automatically <b>to</b> <b>milk</b> the cows, was permitted in theory by the Chazon Ish and became practical in the late 20th century. It is currently practiced by the religious kibbutz at Sde Eliyahu.|$|R
40|$|The {{repertory}} {{grid method}} and the 'item by use' appropriateness method {{were used to}} study the place milk occupies within the diet, its perceived appropriateness and people's beliefs concerning different types of milk. The results of both methods suggest that consumers tend to find their most used type of milk suitable for all their uses of milk. In the repertory grid study the high-fat milk users separated the <b>milks</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent on 'taste/flavour', 'richness', and 'wateriness' whereas the low-fat milk users separated the <b>milks</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent on 'fat content', 'creaminess', 'richness', and 'healthiness'. In the 'item by use' appropriateness study high-fat milk users used no particular use-attribute <b>to</b> separate the <b>milks,</b> whereas the low-fat milk users separated the <b>milks</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent on 'when I want something low in calories', 'when I want something that contains little fat', and 'when on a diet'. © 1992...|$|R

5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the colostrum quality and changes in composition {{during the first three}} dayspostpartum. Researches were carried out on five Romanian Black and White primiparous cows. Samples ofcolostrum were collected at calving and at 4 -hour interval for three days. Samples were analyzed forimmunoglobulin concentration using a ELISA test. The colostrum was analyzed in order to measure immunoglobulintype IgA and IgM concentrations. The maximum concentration of immunoglobulin Ig A in colostral milk was foundas expected at the first milking 4. 2 mg/ml. The concentrations of immunoglobulin type Ig M decreased in the firstday after calving from 4. 9 mg/ml at first <b>milking</b> <b>to</b> 4. 2 mg/ml at the sixth milking. The concentrations ofimmunoglobulin type Ig A decreased in the third day after calving from 1. 9 mg/ml at thirteenth <b>milking</b> <b>to</b> 1. 5 mg/mlat the eighteenth milking.

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E

5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E

5|$|When {{the line}} opened, it {{received}} a lot of freight traffic {{for the construction of a}} power station in Årdal. From the opening, the Flåm Line was the fastest means of transport between Sogn and both Oslo and Bergen, and most post was also sent via the line. From 1977, most of the post was instead sent by truck via Gol, and only post from Aurland went via the railway. Other products sent by the line were <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> the dairy in Voss, which terminated in 1983, as well as fruit. Partial loads saw a large increase during the 1960s, after NSB and the ferry operator Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane teamed up to send packages via Flåm to Oslo and Bergen. Flåm had several arrivals until 1973, when Linjegods was established. Following a reorganization, the number of calls was reduced to once per week. Freight volume fell further during the 1980s; an attempt in 1978 to force the three major distributors Linjegods, Firda Billag and Sogn Billag to route traffic via the Flåm Line failed.|$|E
5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support {{on the basis of}} his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls. In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{distributed}} about 4,100tons of {{food and}} 200,000litres of <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> the affected victims, by both land and air. In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency Housing Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost their homes or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E
