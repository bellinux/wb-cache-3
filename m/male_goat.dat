5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a <b>male</b> <b>goat)</b> is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E

Just after the completion of this period, animals in group A were fed control ration (without gossypol), those in group B were fed ration which contained unboiled CSC as a source of free and bound gossypol, while animals in group C were given ration containing CSC boiled at 100 C for 1 hour as a source of bound gossypol These experimental rations were fed to animals of respective groups at the rate of 3 % of their liveweight for a period of 90 days and it was named as treatment period. Feeding of ration containing gossypol to Teddy <b>male</b> <b>goats</b> did not affect the colour, volume, mass activity, sperm concentration, percentage of dead spermatozoa, liveability and absolute index of liveability of spermatozoa at 37 °C.

60|$|Each male animal {{uses his}} weapons {{in his own}} {{peculiar}} fashion. The common ram makes a charge and butts with such force with the bases of his horns, that I have seen a powerful man knocked over as easily as a child. Goats and certain species of sheep, for instance the Ovis cycloceros of Afghanistan,[305] rear on their hind legs, and then not only butt, but “make a cut down and a jerk up, with the ribbed front of their scimitar-shaped horn, as with a sabre. When the O. cycloceros attacked a large domestic ram, who was a noted bruiser, he conquered him by the sheer novelty of his mode of fighting, always closing at once with his adversary, and catching him across the face and nose with a sharp drawing jerk of his head, and then bounding {{out of the way}} before the blow could be returned.” In Pembrokeshire a <b>male</b> <b>goat,</b> the master of a flock which during several generations had run wild, was known to have killed several other males in single combat; this goat possessed enormous horns, measuring 39 inches in a straight line from tip to tip. The common bull, as every one knows, gores and tosses his opponent; but the Italian buffalo is said never to use his horns, he gives a tremendous blow with his convex forehead, and then tramples on his fallen enemy with his knees—an instinct which the common bull does not possess.[306] Hence a dog who pins a buffalo by the nose is immediately crushed. We must, however, remember that the Italian buffalo has long been domesticated, and {{it is by no means}} certain that the wild parent-form had similarly shaped horns. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when a female Cape buffalo (Bubalus caffer) was turned into an enclosure with a bull of the same species, she attacked him, and he in return pushed her about with great violence. But it was manifest to Mr. Bartlett that had not the bull shewn dignified forbearance, he could easily have killed her by a single lateral thrust with his immense horns. The giraffe uses his short hair-covered horns, which are rather longer in the male than in the female, in a curious manner; for with his long neck he swings his head to either side, almost upside down, with such force, that I have seen a hard plank deeply indented by a single blow.|$|E

6000|$|From {{the recent}} {{researches}} of M. Brandt, most naturalists {{now believe that}} all our goats are descended from the Capra aegagrus of the mountains of Asia, possibly mingled with the allied Indian species C. falconeri of India. (3/97. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Generale' tome 3 page 87. Mr. Blyth 'Land and Water' 1867 page 37 has arrived at a similar conclusion, but he thinks that certain Eastern races may perhaps be in part descended from the Asiatic markhor.) In Switzerland, during the neolithic period, the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep; and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now common in Switzerland. (3/98. Rutimeyer 'Pfahlbauten' s. 127.) At the present time, the many races found in several {{parts of the world}} differ greatly from each other; nevertheless, as far as they have been tried (3/99. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 402.) they are all quite fertile when crossed. So numerous are the breeds, that Mr. G. Clark (3/100. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat History' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363.) has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one island of Mauritius. The ears of one kind were enormously developed, being, as measured by Mr. Clark, no less than 19 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in breadth. As with cattle, the mammae of those breeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed; and, as Mr. Clark remarks, [...] "it is not rare to see their teats touching the ground." [...] The following cases are worth notice as presenting unusual points of variation. According to Godron (3/101. 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 406. Mr. Clark also refers to differences {{in the shape of the}} mammae. Godron states that in the Nubian race the scrotum is divided into two lobes; and Mr. Clark gives a ludicrous proof of this fact, for he saw in the Mauritius a <b>male</b> <b>goat</b> of the Muscat breed purchased at a high price for a female in full milk. These differences in the scrotum are probably not due to descent from distinct species: for Mr. Clark states that this part varies much in form.), the mammae differ greatly in shape in different breeds, being elongated in the common goat, hemispherical in the Angora race, and bilobed and divergent in the goats of Syria and Nubia. According to this same author, the males of certain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour. In one of the Indian breeds the males and females have horns of widely-different shapes (3/102. Mr. Clark 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 361.); and in some breeds the females are destitute of horns. (3/103. Desmarest 'Encyclop. Method. Mammalogie' page 480.) M. Ramu of Nancy informs me that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a pair of hairy appendages, 70 mm. in length and about 10 mm. in diameter, which in external appearance resemble those above described on the jaws of pigs. The presence of inter-digital pits or glands on all four feet has been thought to characterise the genus Ovis, and their absence to be characteristic of the genus Capra; but Mr. Hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet of the majority of Himalayan goats. (3/104. 'Journal of Asiatic Soc. of Bengal' volume 16 1847 pages 1020, 1025.) Mr. Hodgson measured the intestines in two goats of the Dugu race, and he found that the proportional length of the great and small intestines differed considerably.

40|$|Abstract Background Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan {{protozoan}} that {{is considered}} one of the main agents responsible for abortion in ruminants. The lesions found in the central nervous system (CNS) of aborted fetuses show multifocal necrosis, gliosis, and perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells, but the inflammatory and glial cells have not been immunophenotypically characterized. The lesions in the CNS of infected adult animals have rarely been described. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the lesions, the immunophenotypes of the inflammatory and glial cells and the expression of MHC-II and PCNA in the CNS of goats infected with N. caninum. The CNS of eight aborted fetuses and six adult <b>male</b> <b>goats</b> naturally infected with N. caninum were analyzed with lectin histochemistry (RCA 1) and immunohistochemistry (with anti-CD 3, −CD 79 α, −GFAP, −MHC-II, and -PCNA antibodies). All animals were the offspring of dams naturally infected with N. caninum. Results The microscopic lesions in the CNS of the aborted fetuses consisted of perivascular cuffs composed mainly of macrophages (RCA 1 +), rare T lymphocytes (CD 3 +), and rare B lymphocytes (CD 79 α+). Multifocal necrosis surrounded by astrocytes (GFAP+), gliosis composed predominantly of monocytic-lineage cells (macrophages and microglia, RCA 1 +), and the cysts of N. caninum, related (or not) to the lesions were present. Similar lesions were found in four of the six <b>male</b> <b>goats,</b> and multinucleate giant cells related to focal gliosis were also found in three adult goats. Anti-GFAP immunostaining showed astrocytes characterizing areas of glial scarring. Cysts of N. caninum were found in three adult <b>male</b> <b>goats.</b> The presence of N. caninum was evaluated with histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and PCR. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated anti-PCNA labeling of macrophages and microglia in the perivascular cuffs and the expression of MHC-II by microglia and endothelial cells in the CNS of the aborted fetuses and adult <b>male</b> <b>goats.</b> Conclusions Macrophages and microglia were the predominant inflammatory cells in the CNS of aborted fetuses and healthy adult <b>male</b> <b>goats</b> infected with N. caninum.

A female group of goats (n = 20) was exposed to non-sedated males, who displayed an intense sexual behavior and provided strong odor (non-sedated group). Another female group of goats (n = 20) was exposed to the photo-stimulated <b>male</b> <b>goats,</b> but these <b>males</b> were sedated with Xylazine 2 % to prevent the expression of sexual behavior (sedated group). The sedated males provided also strong odor. Females of both groups had full physical and visual contact with non-sedated or sedated males. In both groups, the males remained with females during 4 d. The LH preovulatory surge of 10 female goats per group was measured by determination of LH plasma concentrations in samples taken every 3 h. In addition, in all goats, (n= 20 by group), ovulation was determined by measuring plasma concentrations of progesterone. The proportion of female goats showing a preovulatory LH surge was higher in goats exposed to non-sedated (10 / 10) than in those exposed to sedated bucks (0 / 10; P< 0. 0001). Similarly, most of does in contact with non-sedated males ovulated (19 / 20), but none of those in contact with sedated males did so (0 / 20; P< 0. 0001).

Pregnant goats also tend to have a higher rate of shedding of cashmere than males (Ansari-Renani et al. 2001, 2011).
