40|$|A high {{attrition}} rate exists among new <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> {{in a public}} school district in Central Texas. This problem is mirrored by a high {{attrition rate}} of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> across the United States. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore reasons for the attrition of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> at the study site, to articulate why some new <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> have left the profession, and to identify supports that could be influential in retaining new <b>music</b> <b>teachers.</b> The study was grounded in Gardner 2 ̆ 7 s theory that administrators have the ability to make policy changes that can influence retention and attrition rates for <b>music</b> <b>teachers.</b> Data were collected through individual interviews with 3 administrators, 3 new <b>music</b> <b>teachers,</b> and a focus group of 3 former <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> who resigned from their positions at the study site. Data were open coded and thematically analyzed for reoccurring themes. Findings indicated that the high attrition rate of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> at the study site may result from unequal treatment of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> compared to core content teachers. Another issue noted was the lack of understanding by <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> and administrators about available supports to new teachers. Recommendations include providing equal opportunities to <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> to attend subject-specific professional learning communities and professional development activities. This study may contribute to social change through adjustments to the training and mentoring structures for new <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> in the local district, which may ultimately decrease the turnover of <b>music</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The way {{in which}} <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> choose and use the subject content in {{ensemble}} and music theory in the upper secondary school is focused in this study. The point of interest is the everyday classroom teaching of <b>music</b> <b>teachers.</b> The intentions that <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> have with their teaching is also studied. This thesis is a study of music teaching and is a subject-didactic investigation, inspired by variation theory. The overarching aim of the thesis is to study how <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> in upper secondary school choose teaching content when teaching ensemble and music theory. The teachers’ use of the teaching content implies that they choose to focus and teach certain parts in their teaching. This choice of con- tent {{and how it is}} used is in focus in this study. The research questions are: How do <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> choose teaching content when teaching ensemble and music theory in upper secondary school? How do <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> use the teaching con- tent in their teaching? The data collection includes video-documented lessons and qualitative inter- views with five <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> in upper secondary school in 2004. The analysis reveals two different choices of content. When the <b>teachers</b> have <b>music</b> and theory as the content of their teaching, it is the content that guides the teaching methods, where the teacher uses a fixed content, which is then presented in different ways; this was mainly in music theory. When the content is music activities, the <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> adjust the activity-based content in accordance with the level of the pupils’ skills in ensemble. The differences that occur in the varia- tion theory results are closely related to the teaching content. The foundations of the two different choices of content that are made by the <b>music</b> <b>teachers,</b> as well as the significance of the learning objects, are finally discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Today {{the rapid}} {{developments}} {{experienced in the}} technology brings various facilities in music teaching as {{in many areas of}} education. Though the research conducted on the benefitting levels of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> from teaching technologies is limited, in the researches implemented it is underlined that the application of teaching technologies by <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> in the class has enabled the classes to be attractive, and strengthened the learning-teaching environment. Therefore the behaviors of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> towards teaching technologies are significant. In this study, the behaviors of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> towards teaching technologies is evaluated based on the 4 basic aspects (self-efficacy, outcome expectations, interest and intentions) of the Social-Cognitive Career Theory (Hackett, Lent and Brown, 1994, 2002).

40|$|The {{majority}} of music lessons in primary schools {{are covered by}} generalist primary <b>music</b> <b>teachers,</b> usually {{with little or no}} training in teaching it. This practice-based research project is part a PhD program to professionalize generalist <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> in primary schools to teach music lessons. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe changes in the generalist primary music teachers´ didactic classroom practices in teaching music. Moreover, this study aimed to analyze the generalist primary music teachers´ development of their `musical self-concept` (Spychiger, 2010). This longitudinal intervention study is qualitative in character. Participants were 8 generalist primary <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> and 4 specialist primary <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> (control group). The 8 generalist primary <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> were divided into two groups. The first group (n= 4) received four coaching sessions (group 1), the second group (n= 4) received four coaching sessions and 56 hours of further education in music didactics (group 2). The control group received no special treatment. The individual coaching sessions for all generalist primary <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> (group 1 and 2) followed the `Content Focused Coaching` (CFC) concept. Empirical data were collected before the beginning and at the end of the study by video-observations of classroom performances in primary music lessons (n= 24), and questionnaires concerning the teachers `musical self-concepts` (n= 24). The first findings seem to suggest on the one hand that generalist <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> require fairly little support to enhance their didactic performance of teaching music in primary music lessons. But on the other hand it appears that coaching without a parallel measure of further education seems to be to no avail for the group of less musically trained generalist <b>music</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{previous}} findings {{have shown that}} musicians as well as <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> differ in personality characteristics from the general population. There are strong indications that musicians are exposed to numerous stressful situations during their education and professional life. We aimed to: identify preferred coping styles of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> and their possible difference in comparison to non-music teachers* coping styles, {{as well as to}} depict their relationship taking into consideration certain socio-demographic variables. The sample consists of <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> (N= 67) who teach instruments and <b>music</b> theory and <b>teachers</b> who teach general subjects (N= 72). All the teachers filled in the Plutchik*s Coping Styles Questionnaire. We included gender, educational level, working experience and urban/non-urban environment as socio-demographical variables. Findings show that <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> have preferred coping styles such as: minimizing the problem, avoiding the problem, asking others for help, doing unrelated pleasurable activities, but also improving shortcomings. On the other hand, no differences were found regarding the coping styles profile between <b>music</b> and non-music <b>teachers.</b> There are indications that female teachers are more prone to use avoiding, help seeking and substitution behavioral strategies, but they are also prone to use improving personal limitations or limitations imposed by the situation. Results show that there are differences, to a certain extent, between: older and younger <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>music</b> <b>teachers</b> from urban and non-urban environments. We may conclude that mainly passive and avoiding styles and dysfunctional strategies in tension reduction are used by both groups of teachers...|$|R
