5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These {{are attracted}} by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, and upon alighting {{on the plant}} adhere to the sticky drops of <b>mucilage.</b> Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky <b>mucilage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet <b>mucilage</b> to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky <b>mucilage</b> which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the <b>mucilage</b> envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E
5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional <b>mucilage</b> to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the <b>mucilage</b> clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
40|$|Opuntia ficus indica cladodes {{possess a}} {{protective}} action against ethanol-induced ulcer in the rat. The major components of cladodes are carbohydrate polymers, mainly <b>mucilages</b> and pectin. To clarify the cytoprotective effects of cladodes on experimental ethanol-induced ulcer in rat, <b>mucilages</b> and pectin were extracted and were administered instead of cladodes. The above mentioned effects induced by cladodes {{may be attributed}} to <b>mucilages,</b> and not significantly to pectin. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition, physicochemical, {{functional and}} sensory properties of <b>mucilages,</b> extracted from seven Italian flax cultivars, were evaluated. All samples were composed of neutral and acidic sugars, {{with a low}} protein content. From the NMR data, a rhamnogalacturonan backbone could be inferred as a common structural feature for all the <b>mucilages,</b> with some variations depending on the cultivar. All the suspensions showed a poor stability, which was consistent with a low zeta potential absolute value. The viscosity seemed to be positively correlated with the neutral sugars and negatively {{with the amount of}} proteins. Functional properties were dependent on the cultivar. The sensory analysis showed that most <b>mucilages</b> are tasteless. All these outcomes could support the use of flaxseed <b>mucilages</b> for industrial applications. In particular, Solal and Festival cultivars could be useful as thickeners, due to their high viscosity, while Natural, Valoal and Kaolin as emulsifiers for their good surface-active properties...|$|R
40|$|Plant root <b>mucilages</b> contain {{powerful}} surfactants {{that will}} alter {{the interaction of}} soil solids with water and ions, and the rates of microbial processes. • The lipid composition of maize, lupin and wheat root <b>mucilages</b> was analysed by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A commercially available phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), chemically similar to the phospholipid surfactants identified in the <b>mucilages,</b> was then used to evaluate its effects on selected soil properties. • The lipids found in the <b>mucilages</b> were principally phosphatidylcholines, composed mainly of saturated fatty acids, {{in contrast to the}} lipids extracted from root tissues. In soil at low tension, lecithin reduced the water content at any particular tension by as much as 10 and 50 % in soil and acid-washed sand, respectively. Lecithin decreased the amount of phosphate adsorption in soil and increased the phosphate concentration in solution by 10 %. The surfactant also reduced net rates of ammonium consumption and nitrate production in soil. • These experiments provide the first evidence we are aware of that plant-released surfactants will significantly modify the biophysical environment of the rhizosphere...|$|R
5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains <b>mucilage,</b> several saponins, coumarin and glycosides. Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included dyeing and making torches.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional <b>mucilage</b> from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in <b>mucilage.</b> P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike <b>mucilage,</b> is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E

50|$|RR {{has been}} used on plant {{material}} since 1890 for staining pectins, <b>mucilages,</b> and gums. RR is a stereoselective stain for pectic acid, insofar as the staining site occurs between each monomer unit and the next adjacent neighbor.|$|R
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of <b>mucilage,</b> which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|The tentacle-covered leaves {{can capture}} large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all Drosera species have {{specialised}} stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky <b>mucilage.</b> The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it. In its native fynbos habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. Of the two known populations of D.regia, the higher altitude site {{appears to be}} overgrown and is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered Drosera species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and a single cultivar has been registered.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in <b>mucilage</b> or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E

In recent years there have been important developments in different dosage forms for existing and newly designed drugs and natural products, and semi-synthetic as well as synthetic excipients often need to be used for a variety of purposes. Gums and <b>mucilages</b> are widely used natural materials for conventional and novel dosage forms. These natural materials have advantages over synthetic ones since they are chemically inert, nontoxic, less expensive, biodegradable and widely available. They can also be modified in different ways to obtain tailor-made materials for drug delivery systems and thus can compete with the available synthetic excipients.

5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more coarsely scaly stipe, and lack of <b>mucilage</b> in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of <b>mucilage</b> has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found that material labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA. In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos <b>mucilage,</b> which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E

The phytochemical study of these plants revealed that: C. mucronata contains alkaloids and tannins; A. senegalensis contains tannins, <b>mucilages</b> and reducing compounds; C. filiformis contains alkaloids, tannins (gallic tannins and cathetics) and mucilage; N. leavis contains tannins, triterpenoids, <b>mucilages</b> and reducing compounds.
