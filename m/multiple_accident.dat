50|$|After a {{crash in}} {{pre-season}} testing by regular driver JJ Lehto (who broke a vertebra), Verstappen drove {{in the first}} two races of the season as a substitute, partnering Michael Schumacher and made his Formula One debut at the 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix. During the race he collided with Eddie Irvine, which triggered a <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> also involving Éric Bernard and Martin Brundle. Verstappen's car somersaulted, but he emerged unharmed. At the Pacific Grand Prix Verstappen ran 6th but spun off on cold tyres immediately after a pit stop. Lehto was fit for the next race at Imola, but his performances in subsequent races were disappointing and he was rested by Benetton following the Canadian Grand Prix, allowing Verstappen to return to the race seat.|$|E
50|$|The car {{made its}} debut in the 1974 South African Grand Prix, driven by Jean-Pierre Beltoise, who {{qualified}} in 11th position. However, a positive drive through the field yielded a second-place finish. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Beltoise again qualified 11th but retired after two laps, with an engine problem. At Belgium, he qualified seventh and finished fifth. At Monaco, Beltoise, who had qualified 11th and led the first practice times at one point, was in collision with Denny Hulme's McLaren on the first lap when the New Zealander got off-line and in attempting to rejoin, triggered a <b>multiple</b> <b>accident.</b> For this race, a second P201 chassis had been produced with outboard front disc brakes rather than inboard but was not used.|$|E

The entry for the Monaco Grand Prix was cut back, and only Merzario raced, but he retired after a <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> at the start. Before the Swedish Grand Prix, Merzario had broken a finger in a sports car crash, {{and after a few}} practice laps, he decided against racing in Sweden. British driver Richard Robarts was scheduled to substitute for him alongside the returning Belsø, but the Dane damaged his car in practice and ultimately raced Robarts' car instead.

50|$|Alliot {{qualified}} 15th in Hungary, {{his best}} qualifying performance {{so far that}} season, but flat-spotted a tyre on lap 2 of the race. The consequent vibration caused a crack in a suspension wishbone, which eventually broke on lap 49, and Alliot had to retire from 13th place. In Austria, Alliot started 22nd, again the fastest in his class. The start of the race was chaotic, with the first start aborted due to a <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> {{at the rear of}} the field, which Alliot avoided, but he was caught up in a worse incident at the second start when Nigel Mansell suffered a slipping clutch, and twelve cars were damaged trying to avoid the British driver's Williams. Alliot took the third start in the spare LC87, and finished 12th, three laps down.|$|E
50|$|The race {{plan was}} for 0194 and 0195 to lap at 4m 15s. On lap 28 McLaren in 0195 pitted when leading the GT class and 10th overall.

50|$|The race - now {{bearing the}} BRDC International Trophy name - {{took place in}} heavy rain, {{allowing}} Cheever to demonstrate Pirelli's wet weather superiority in the well-tested Osella-BMW. He dominated until a <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> involving Stohr at the Woodcote chicane caused a race stoppage after two laps. After the restart Henton and Daly pushed the American hard until Henton suffered gear selection problems and Daly span. The latter recovered strongly after the rain stopped and the track dried out to take the lead, only to suffer gear linkage problems, allowing Cheever through to take victory on the last lap by only three-tenths of a second. Henton held on to take 3rd ahead of Rahal, with South (despite twice leaving the track at Woodcote) and Columbo completing the top six. The fancied March cars proved a disappointment - the 792 was overweight and generated too much grip, resulting in a machine with heavy handling. Surer failed to start the race after sliding off on the parade lap and being hit by team-mate Gabbiani.|$|E

40|$|The {{report is}} an attempt to {{describe}} the effects on accidents of compulsory use of running lights - low beam or special lamps - during daylight in Sweden. The study is carried out on police reported traffic accidents with personal injury in Sweden. The before and after periods are two years before and two years after the operative day of the law, October 1 st 1977. The use of running lights in the before-period was roughly speaking 50 % and in the after-period over 95 %. The basic assumption is that the use of running lights in daylight influences <b>multiple</b> <b>accidents</b> in daylight and only those. The method used is to study the relation of daylight to darkness numbers of <b>multiple</b> <b>accidents.</b> The corresponding relation for single vehicle accidents is taken as control. The estimated total effect depends both on the subdivision of accident data and the method used for accidents with unprotected road users.

40|$|Hierarchical or {{multilevel}} modeling extends traditional GLM or non-linear models {{by giving}} {{certain of the}} model parameters their own probability sub-models. Hierarchical modeling {{can be viewed as}} an extension of Bayesian credibility theory that allows one to build models for data that are grouped along a dimension containing multiple levels. In particular, hierarchical modeling can be used to analyze longitudinal datasets containing multiple observations for each of several subjects. A contention of this paper is that traditional loss reserving triangles are most naturally regarded as longitudinal datasets. Non-linear hierarchical models – known also as non-linear mixed effects models – therefore provide a natural and flexible framework in which to model loss development across <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> years. The use of non-linear growth curves together with multilevel modeling techniques allows one to build models that are at once parsimonious and easy to interpret. Finally, because they incorporate growth curves, such models obviate the need to specify tail factors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decade, the {{shipping}} industry has implemented {{a number of}} measures aimed at improving its safety level (such as new regulations or new forms of team training). Despite this evolution, shipping accidents, and particularly collisions, remain a major concern. This paper presents {{a modified version of}} the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, which has been adapted to the maritime context and used to analyse human and organisational factors in collisions reported by the Marine Accident and Investigation Branch (UK) and the Transportation Safety Board (Canada). The analysis shows that most collisions are due to decision errors. At the precondition level, it highlights the importance of the following factors: poor visibility and misuse of instruments (environmental factors), loss of situation awareness or deficit of attention (conditions of operators), deficits in inter-ship communications or Bridge Resource Management (personnel factors). At the leadership level, the analysis reveals the frequent planning of inappropriate operations and non-compliance with the Safety Management System (SMS). The <b>Multiple</b> <b>Accident</b> Analysis provides an important finding concerning three classes of accidents. Inter-ship communications problems and Bridge Resource Management deficiencies are closely linked to collisions occurring in restricted waters and involving pilot-carrying vessels. Another class of collisions is associated with situations of poor visibility, in open sea, and shows deficiencies at every level of the socio-technical system (technical environment, condition of operators, leadership level, and organisational level). The third class is characterised by non-compliance with the SMS. This study shows the importance of Bridge Resource Management for situations of navigation with a pilot on board in restricted waters. It also points out the necessity to investigate, for situations of navigation in open sea, the masters' decisions in critical conditions as well as the causes of non-compliance with SMS...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop statistical models for multivariate road accident data. Two directions of research are followed: graphical modelling for contingency tables cross-classified by accident characteristics, and hierarchical Bayesian models for <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> frequencies of different types modelled jointly. Multi-dimensional tables are analysed and it is shown how to use collapsibility to reduce the dimensionality of the analysis without the problems of Simpson's paradox. It is revealed that accident severity {{and the number of}} casualties are associated, and that these variables are mainly influenced by the number of vehicles and speed limit. Graphical chain models allow causal hypotheses to be formulated and it is shown how they are valuable tools for empirical research about road accident characteristics. The hierarchical Bayesian models developed combine generalized linear models with random effects. The novelty of these models consists in the joint modelling of multiple response variables. The models account for overdispersion and they are used for accident prediction and for ranking hazardous sites. All models are fully Bayesian and are fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. It is shown that multiple response variables models are superior to separate univariate response models. Some theoretical problems are examined regarding the maximum likelihood estimation process for the two parameters negative binomial distribution. A condition is given that is equivalent with unique maximum likelihood estimators. The two directions of research are connected by using graphs to describe the models. In addition, a new Bayesian model selection procedure for contingency tables is proposed. This is based on Gibbs sampling and avoids problems associated with asymptotic tests. The conclusions revealed here can help practitioners to design better safety policies and to spend money more wisely on sites that really are dangerous...|$|E
40|$|This is a report. The {{research}} {{described in}} this report has been performed by Loughborough Design School (LDS) under the CLOCS programme funded by TfL. The project was specified to allow {{an understanding of the}} variability of blind spots in direct vision through windows and indirect vision through mirrors for the top selling HGVs in the UK. The impetus for the research was the increasing number of accidents between Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) and HGVs in London. The aim was to compare the manufacturers’ most sold vehicle specifications to determine which vehicle design variables can affect the size of blind spots, and to explore issues that have been raised in previous research including the potential for construction HGVs to be involved in more accidents with VRUs than distribution variants of HGV designs. The LDS team have utilised a virtual modelling technique to explore this issue. This virtual approach allows <b>multiple</b> <b>accident</b> scenarios to be modelled and simulated. In order to allow the analysis of vehicle blind spots 19 vehicle models have been created by digitally scanning the real world vehicles. The vehicles that have been modelled include construction, distribution and long haul HGV designs, as well as ‘high vision’ low entry cab designs. These models have been used in combination with simulations of cyclist and pedestrian VRUs in a manner which recreates critical accident scenarios that have been defined through the analysis of accident data. This involves placing the simulated VRUs in a number of defined locations adjacent to the vehicle. Subsequently the simulated VRUs are moved away from the vehicle into a position where they ‘just can’t be seen’ by the driver of the vehicle, i. e. if they were moved further away they would be partially visible to the driver. The distance that the VRU simulation is away from the side or front of the vehicle cab determines the size of the direct vision blind spot. In this way vehicle designs and configurations can be compared. In addition to this further testing was performed to determine if the VRUs located in the direct vision blind spots could be viewed by the driver through the use of mirrors. The final analysis technique utilised a method which projects the volume of space that can be seen by a driver through the windows and mirrors on the surface of sphere. This provides a field of view value which can be used to compare the glazed area of HGVs and provides a method to distinguish between vehicles that perform at the same level in the VRU simulation. The results of the work highlight the follow key issues. 1. All standard vehicle configurations have blind spots which can hide VRUs from the driver’s direct vision 2. The height of the cab above the ground is the key vehicle factor which affects the size of direct vision and indirect vision blind spots 3. The design of window apertures and the driver location in relation to these window apertures can reduce the size of the identified blind spots. i. e. two different vehicle designs with the same cab height can have different results for blind spot size due to window design and driver seat location 4. Low entry cab designs, which are the lowest of the 19 vehicles tested, demonstrated real benefits in terms of reducing direct vision blind spots when compared to standard vehicle designs 5. The construction vehicles assessed in the project are on average 32...|$|E
