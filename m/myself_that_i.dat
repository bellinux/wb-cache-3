5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E

500|$|Pinkerton {{is named}} after the {{character}} BF Pinkerton from Madama Butterfly, who marries a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an [...] "asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star", Cuomo felt the character was [...] "the perfect symbol for the part of <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{trying to come to}} terms with on this album." [...] Other titles considered included Playboy and Diving into the Wreck (after a poem by Adrienne Rich).|$|E
500|$|Furtado {{wanted to}} make a pop music record [...] "to prove to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could be more streamlined", and cited as a major {{influence}} Madonna's album Ray of Light, saying that [...] "she was smooth but sexy, universal, epic, iconic!" [...] Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine suggested for Furtado to work with Timbaland, who had produced Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On", which featured Furtado in a remix, and done a remix of Furtado's hit [...] "Turn Off the Light”.|$|E
500|$|The {{family moved}} to the suburb of Juhu when Kapoor was one month old. She was educated at the Arya Vidya Mandir school in Juhu, where she confessed to being a [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "carefree" [...] child who would bully the boys. She excelled at sports such as rugby and basketball, and trained in Kathak, {{classical}} music and Latin dance. Kapoor, who practices Hinduism, states that she is [...] "quite religious", {{and that it is}} a way of [...] "reminding <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need to be thankful for so much".|$|E

500|$|Many of the album's {{lyrics are}} {{narrative}} and diaristic in nature, and were heavily drawn from Love's {{personal life and}} experiences in her teenage and young adult years. In a press release promoting the album, Love said: [...] "These songs are about my own weaknesses and impurities; things about <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hate... paranoias, petty concerns, and pithy, pathetic things that are inside of me." [...] The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence, and, particularly, violence against women. Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, [...] "red lights", and self-destructiveness. Q Magazine described the lyrics on the record as [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "genuinely uninhibited." ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{overshadowed by}} Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and {{a hand in}} all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
5000|$|I'm OK {{and you are}} OK. This is {{the healthiest}} {{position}} about life and it means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel good about <b>myself</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel good about others and their competence.|$|R

500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|In November 1863, {{when the}} {{military}} cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett, by then widely renowned as the finest orator in the country, was invited to be the featured speaker. In his two-hour formal oration he compared the Battle of Gettysburg to battles of antiquity such as Marathon, and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the War of the Roses and the Thirty Years' War) were able to reconcile their differences afterward. [...] Everett's oration {{was followed by the}} now far more famous Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting [...] "I should be glad if I could flatter <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes." [...] In the 1864 election, Everett supported Lincoln, serving as a presidential elector from Massachusetts for the Republicans.|$|E
500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

500|$|A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was {{launched}} on several websites in early November 2010. The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would never give to another director." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{spent the}} next three years {{drifting}} between various odd jobs and temporary work. As Moore himself recounted in the book, Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, by the fall of 1986, he was [...] "less than a year into my career as a college dropout ... working as a medical records technician (otherwise known as a receptionist) at an animal hospital, all the while telling <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was actually a professional writer simply awaiting my inevitable discovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a private}} paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: [...] "I came to persuade <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was in love}} with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the {{influence}} of [...] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hume was {{extremely}} {{pleased with his}} argument against miracles in his Enquiry. He states [...] "I flatter <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check {{to all kinds of}} superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures." [...] Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.|$|E

[...] I am enlisted for the war. [...] All my energies, all my time, my business experience, and knowledge of affairs I willingly and gladly give the State and nation.

2500|$|The album would {{ultimately}} consist of 15 full-length songs and four short [...] "interludes". As Amos was finding [...] "parts {{and pieces of}} <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never claimed" [...] on this journey, the 14 primary songs represent the number of body parts of the Egyptian god Osiris that his wife, the goddess Isis, had to find to put his body back together in Egyptian mythology. The arrangement of the songs on the album reflects the progression Amos intended to achieve on the double vinyl LP of the album; {{each of the four}} sides of the album on vinyl would open with an interlude track that leads into the rest of the three or four songs on each side. The vinyl release is the only version of the album in which the interludes ("Beauty Queen," [...] "Mr. Zebra," [...] "Way Down," [...] and [...] "Agent Orange") are not numbered.|$|E
