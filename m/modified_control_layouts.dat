40|$|This master's {{project has}} {{consisted}} of designing, implementing, and evaluating a {{graphical user interface}} used to congure a simulated computer system. The project has resulted in two dierent prototypes: a free layout, where the user {{is responsible for the}} <b>layout</b> and a <b>controlled</b> <b>layout,</b> where the layout is created by the application. The prototypes have been evaluated using heuristic evaluation and user tests. The evaluation has shown that the <b>controlled</b> <b>layout</b> is preferable as users are shown to work faster and perform fewer errors with this prototype. The evaluation has also led to a set of design criteria to consider when further developing the application. Graskt användargränssnitt för att kongurera en virtuell dato...|$|R

40|$|A {{control system}} was {{designed}} to allow humans to manually drive an, usually automatic, two wheeled hovercraft. The size, the mass and the way of driving this vehicle proves {{to be an issue}} for the everyday, untrained person to achieve. During this thesis several <b>control</b> <b>layouts</b> were designed with the objective of creating an intuitive and easy way of driving such a vehicle. At the end two where usertested using a simulation (also developed during this thesis) of the said hovercraft set against obstacles similar to those expected to be encountered on its real environment. The two layouts are just slightly apart in performance but numerous issues were found {{that can be used to}} redesign a better <b>control</b> <b>layout.</b> This means that no definitive winner was found but a foundation for a better design was indeed found.

40|$|The {{control limits}} derived for the Median Absolute Deviation  (MAD) based Standard {{deviation}} (S) control chart proposed by Abu-Shawiesh was for monitoring quality characteristics when a standard value of sigma (${sigma}$) is known or {{given by the}} management/ engineers. When sigma (${sigma}$) is unknown and {{we are interested in}} monitoring past/non-normal data, then there is the need to modify the simple robust control limits. In this paper, the control limits for the Shewhart $ar{X}$ and S control chart based on median absolute deviation  were modified using the concept of three sigma (3 ${sigma}$) limits. An evaluation performance tool was also developed to evaluate the efficiency of the <b>modified</b> <b>control</b> chart.   An algorithm implemented on S-Plus programming language was developed to compute the two evaluation parameters used in this study. The results show that the control limits interval and the average run length for the <b>modified</b> <b>control</b> charts is smaller than that of the existing control charts. Therefore, the <b>modified</b> <b>control</b> limits is more efficient than the existing control limits. It is recommended that the <b>modified</b> <b>control</b> limits be used when monitoring past/non-normal data or when there is no standard value of sigma specify by the process engineer/ management...|$|R
