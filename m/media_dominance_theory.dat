40|$|The ``dominance theory'' of HALDANE's rule postulates that hybrids of the {{heterogametic}} sex {{are more}} likely to be inviable or sterile than the homogametic sex because some of the epistatic incompatibilities contributing to postzygotic isolation behave as X-linked partial recessives. When this is true, pairs of taxa with relatively large X chromosomes should require less divergence time, on average, to produce HALDANE's rule than pairs with smaller Xs. Similarly, if the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> is correct and if the X chromosome evolves at a similar rate to the autosomes, the size of the X should not influence the rate at which homogametic hybrids become inviable or sterile. We use Drosophila data to examine both of these predictions. As expected under the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory,</b> pairs of taxa with large X chromosomes (~ 40 % of the nuclear genome) show HALDANE's rule for sterility at significantly smaller genetic distances than pairs with smaller X chromosomes (~ 20 % of the genome). As also predicted, the genetic distances between taxa that exhibit female inviability/sterility show no differences between ``large X'' vs. ``small X'' pairs. We present some simple mathematical models to relate these data to the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> and alternative hypotheses involving faster evolution of the X vs. the autosomes and/or faster evolution of incompatibilities that produce male-specific vs. female-specific sterility. Although the data agree qualitatively with the predictions of the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory,</b> they depart significantly from the quantitative predictions of simple models of the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> and the other hypotheses considered. These departures probably stem from the many simplifying assumptions needed to tractably model epistatic incompatibilities and to analyze heterogeneous data from many taxa...|$|R

50|$|This {{theory has}} widely been {{compared}} to system justification theory since they are both system justifying <b>theories.</b> Social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> focuses on people’s motive to maintain a positive group image by generally supporting hierarchical inequality at the group level. Individuals with a high social dominance orientation (SDO) will hold myths that tend to be hierarchy enhancing, which justify an in-group's place and their relation to it. Thus, in both social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> and system justification theory, there are common threads of group-based opposition to equality and justification for maintaining intergroup inequalities through systemic norms.|$|R
40|$|During {{the process}} of speciation, {{diverging}} taxa often hybridize and produce offspring wherein the heterogametic sex (i. e., XY or ZW) is unfit (Haldane’s rule). <b>Dominance</b> <b>theory</b> seeks to explain Haldane’s rule {{in terms of the}} difference in X-linked dominance regimes experienced by the sexes. However, X inactivation in female mammals extends the effects of hemizygosity to both sexes. Here, we highlight where the assumptions of <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> are particularly problematic in marsupials, where X inactivation uniformly results in silencing the paternal X. We then present evidence of Haldane’s rule for sterility but not for viability in marsupials, as well as the first violations of Haldane’s rule for these traits among all mammals. Marsupials represent a large taxonomic group possessing heteromorphic sex chromosomes, where the <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> cannot explain Haldane’s rule. In this light, we evaluate alternative explanations for the pre-ponderance of male sterility in interspecific hybrids, including faster male evolution, X–Y interactions, and genomic conflict hypotheses.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} examines ways {{to study}} social change using social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> {{in the context}} of gender relations. The first paper outlines a theoretical reconceptualization of social change that focuses on the dynamics of intergroup behavior and power. The remaining papers in this dissertation demonstrate how to conduct social change research using social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> by exploring the effects of ideological norms on support for violence against women, and by exploring violence prevention and collective action aimed at reducing intergroup inequality. I find that societal disagreement (rather than agreement) about sexism predicts normative? justification of domestic violence, and that women are the primary targets of violence in agency-normative contexts. Further, I develop a social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> approach to collective action that complements social identity approaches to collective action. This paper argues that the social <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> provides a better model for men’s collective action motivations, and social identity approaches provide better models for women’s collective action motivations. In the final paper, I present an evaluation of a sexual assault prevention program that targets college men, and find that the program reduces sexism rape myth acceptance in addition to increasing collective action willingness and feminist activism.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a case}} study in the sociology of professions. It reports on the Australian allied health professions, a group that has rarely been the subject of sustained research. The central purpose of the {{research is}} to examine the impact of local workplace organisation in Australian general hospitals in the public sector on the position of the allied health professions and their autonomy. Further, the research seeks to unbundle the competing claims about the utility of alternative organisational approaches and to examine how the allied health professions negotiate inter-professional relationships as a consequence of particular organisational approaches. The research draws on Eliot Freidson's professional <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> (medical <b>dominance</b> <b>theory)</b> as the underpinning theoretical framework. Medical <b>dominance</b> <b>theory</b> portrays the allied health professions as inevitably subject to medical dominance and subordination, a proposition which is critically appraised through a contemporary analysis of local workplace arrangements. To address these issues three models of allied health profession organisation were identified; the classical medical model, division of allied health model and the unit dispersement model. The research method involved a comparative case study approach and included fifty-three interviews, document analysis, observation strategies and key informants over a two year period. Data collection was guided by seventeen themes of inquiry which were identified from a multiple methods approach as likely to be important in a comparative analysis of the organisation of the allied health professions...|$|R
40|$|Social <b>Dominance</b> <b>Theory</b> has {{problematic}} {{implications for}} humanitarian work: It suggests that stakeholders of the humanitarian sector collectively maintain the social hierarchies that disadvantage the very minorities {{that they are}} supposed to empower. Minority Influence Theory, on the other hand, suggests that social innovation in the humanitarian sector can emerge from the bottom-up, thus against the grain of social hierarchies. This thesis explores for the refugee service sector of Auckland, New Zealand, (a) if former refugees are indeed marginalised within the inter-organisational context that is supposed to empower them, (b) if this has detrimental effects on the sector’s performance, and (c) if fostering minority influence might alleviate such effects. The first research question was approached through a stakeholder analysis, which revealed that the social hierarchies within the refugee service sector indeed mirror the marginalisation of former refugees in general New Zealand society. Then, stories of positive and negative incidents of collaboration in the sector were analysed through the lenses of Social <b>Dominance</b> <b>Theory</b> and Minority Influence Theory. A thematic analysis of negative incidents of collaboration gathered accounts of discrimination through disregard, as well as legitimising myths. The latter concerned the inaccessibility of services, confounding participation with collaboration, voluntarism as unambiguously positive, feelings of indebtedness among former refugees, and the false belief in opportunities in New Zealand. These findings support the idea that social dominance perpetuates social hierarchies in the refugee service sector and thereby negatively affects its performance. However, the assumptions of Social <b>Dominance</b> <b>Theory</b> concerning behavioural asymmetry did not match the data, which indicates different root causes of social dominance than claimed by the theory’s authors. Stories of successful collaboration involved factors that facilitate minority influence, such as finding consistency, appealing to common values, enough time, bottom-up accountability in the form of community ownership, and trust. This suggests that facilitating minority influence in the Auckland refugee service sector simultaneously facilitates collaboration. Social <b>Dominance</b> <b>Theory</b> and Minority Influence Theory proved to be instrumental to analysing problems within the inter-organisational context of refugee services and for finding indications for future research and better practice...|$|R
