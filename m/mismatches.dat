5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA.

Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal <b>mismatches,</b> whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

A measurement technique {{based on the}} conventional S-parameter measurement is developed to measure the <b>mismatch</b> behavior at high frequencies (HFs). First, besides the typical de-embedding, the bondpad <b>mismatch</b> is subtracted statistically from the capacitance <b>mismatch</b> measurement. Second, a semi-empirical methodology using physical parameters, such as window CD and vertical doping, is developed to model the measured AC <b>mismatch</b> behavior for transistors of different size. Finally, a systematic procedure is proposed to extract the <b>mismatch</b> parameters, {{which can be used}} in the SPICE Monte-Carlo <b>mismatch</b> simulation. The proposed <b>mismatch</b> modeling methodology is validated on an industrial 0. 35 m RF BiCMOS process. The proposed model fits the <b>mismatch</b> characteristics of the key AC parameters, such as CBE, CBC, and fT at different current densities. The model also scales well with geometry for the transistors with sizes useful for RFIC application. Index Terms — Bipolar modeling, <b>mismatch</b> modeling, RF circuit design...|$|R

5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of <b>mismatches</b> in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E

Using voxel-­-based analysis of coregistrated MR images before and 24 hours after treatment, salvaged <b>mismatch</b> was defined as the initial PWI/DWI <b>mismatch</b> that did not overlap with final infarct. Mean Tmax values were compared between salvaged and infarcted <b>mismatch</b> areas.
