40|$|A novel {{intelligent}} {{fault diagnosis}} method for <b>motor</b> <b>roller</b> bearings which operate under unsteady rotating speed and load is proposed in this paper. The pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD) {{and the relative}} crossing information (RCI) methods are used for extracting the feature spectra from the non-stationary vibration signal measured for condition diagnosis. The RCI is used to automatically extract the feature spectrum from the time-frequency distribution of the vibration signal. The extracted feature spectrum is instantaneous, and not correlated with the rotation speed and load. By using the ant colony optimization (ACO) clustering algorithm, the synthesizing symptom parameters (SSP) for condition diagnosis are obtained. The experimental results shows that the diagnostic sensitivity of the SSP is higher than original symptom parameter (SP), and the SSP can sensitively reflect {{the characteristics of the}} feature spectrum for precise condition diagnosis. Finally, a fuzzy diagnosis method based on sequential inference and possibility theory is also proposed, by which the conditions of the machine can be identified sequentially as well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, the {{stability}} of a Networked Control System (NCS) with time-varying delays is analyzed. A discrete-time state-space model is {{used to analyze the}} dynamics of the NCS. The delay is introduced by the network itself and is assumed to be upperbounded by a fraction of the sample-time. A typical motion control example is presented in which the time-variation of the delay results in an unstable system, although for each fixed delay the system is stable. Conditions in terms of LMIs are presented guaranteeing the robust asymptotic stability of the discrete-time system, given bounds on the uncertain time-varying delay. Moreover, it is shown that the robust stability conditions also guarantee asymptotic stability of the intersample behavior. Additionally, LMIs are presented to synthesize a feedback controller that stabilizes the system for the uncertain time-varying delay. The results are illustrated on an example concerning a mechanical model of a <b>motor</b> driving a <b>roller</b> in a printer. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Industrial Lubrication and Tribology and the definitive published version is available at [URL] This paper proposes the formulation of a nanodiamond particle-loaded food-grade lubricating oil, a nanolubricant, {{that can be used}} over a broad range of loads within the factory (low load applications: conveyor systems; and heavy machinery within the factory were high loads are applied) Design/Methodology: Tribological performance of the nanolubricant at both load levels was studied. A factory-sized conveyor was employed for the low load range using typical beverage packaging (aluminium cans, glass and PET bottles). Coefficients of friction and wear scars were measured and the lubricating performance quantified. A four-ball tester was used to characterise the performance of the nanolubricant as per ASTM D 2783 /D 4172. A comparison between the nanolubricant and the baseline oils was established. Findings: The results show an overall decrease of the coefficients of friction and wear scars for all packages at low pressures when the nanolubricant is used. It also shows a better friction-reduction performance in the high loads. The results indicate that the nanolubricant is versatile at both ranges of loading. Practical/Environmental implications: The current protocols for lubrication in the food and drink factories involve the use of water-based detergents for the conveyor lines, and industry-grade oils for the machinery. The use of a single and versatile lubricant for both ranges of application loads may carry a positive impact on the sustainability and environmental performance of the sector. Originality/value: Beverage processing and packing factories need their mechanised conveyor systems suitably lubricated to avoid excessive friction between the containers and the load bearing surface of the conveyors (e. g. belts or chains). Other areas of the conveying systems, such as <b>motors,</b> gears, <b>rollers</b> and bearings, are also in need of suitable lubrication to prevent failure and lengthen their working life. There is a myriad of lubricants and lubricating solutions for each of these areas independently, but no existing availability of commercial lubricating fluids that could be used on both successfully...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving <b>motors</b> and <b>rollers</b> which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|R
