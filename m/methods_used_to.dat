5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> supplement or replace speech or writing {{for those with}} impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and {{inflammation of the}} skin, intervertebral discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity.

It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency.

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce {{synthetic}} diamond. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) {{and is still}} widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5GPa at 1500°C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and sonication of graphite solutions.|$|E

Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.|$|E

This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, the <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge {{little to no}} business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and {{it can only be}} made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were monophyletic, demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is risky to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E

In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|<b>Methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> prevent malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and {{the prevention}} of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
5|$|The first road in {{the region}} was the Buffalo Trace, an old bison trail that ran from the Falls of the Ohio to Vincennes. After the capitol was {{relocated}} to Corydon, several local roads were created to connect the new capitol to the Ohio River at Mauckport and to New Albany. The first major {{road in the}} state was the National Road, a project funded by the federal government. The road entered Indiana in 1829, connecting Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute with the eastern states and eventually Illinois and Missouri in the west. The state adopted the advanced <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build the national road on a statewide basis and began {{to build a new}} road network that was usable year-round. The North-South Michigan Road was built in the 1830s, connecting Michigan and Kentucky and passing through Indianapolis in the middle. These two new roads were roughly perpendicular within the state and served as the foundation for a road system to encompass all of Indiana.|$|E

For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E
