5|$|A <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> is {{an order}} of the High Court which {{commands}} a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>order.</b> Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order)</b> to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|A <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> is {{an order}} of the High Court {{commanding}} a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

5|$|If a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order,</b> prohibiting {{order or}} quashing order is sought, the {{applicant}} must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order,</b> prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
50|$|Where the magistrates' {{court has}} acted outside of its powers, the High Court may grant quashing <b>orders,</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>orders</b> and prohibiting orders. These orders are {{discretionary}} {{and may be}} refused {{in the interests of}} justice.|$|R

2500|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} a Singapore constitutional claim are the prerogative orders– quashing, prohibiting and <b>mandatory</b> <b>orders,</b> and the order for review of detention– and the declaration. As the [...] is the supreme law of Singapore, the High Court can hold any law enacted by Parliament, subsidiary legislation issued by a minister, or rules derived from the common law, as well as acts and decisions of public authorities, that are inconsistent with the Constitution to be void. <b>Mandatory</b> <b>orders</b> {{have the effect of}} directing authorities to take certain actions, prohibiting orders forbid them from acting, and quashing orders invalidate their acts or decisions. An order for review of detention is sought to direct a party responsible for detaining a person to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the legality of the detention can be established.|$|R
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an {{advocate}} and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{finding that}} a {{decision}} or {{order of a}} public authority is unconstitutional, the High Court may grant a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> (formerly known as mandamus) to compel the authority to perform its duties {{in a manner that}} is consistent with the Constitution. Although there has yet to be any constitutional case where a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> has been granted, it is likely that the Singapore courts will adopt the same legal principles that apply in administrative law. In the latter, the Court has held that it cannot use a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> to direct how and in what manner a public body should perform its duty. Hence, the Court cannot direct the public body to adopt a particular decision but can only order the body to re-consider its prior decision without lapsing into the unlawfulness that affected it. This is based on the well-settled principle that a reviewing court is limited to determining the legality, and must not deal with the substantive merits, of a decision.|$|E
25|$|To {{direct a}} public body fulfil a {{legitimate}} expectation, the court issues a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order</b> (also {{known as a}} mandamus). This is a prerogative order which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and {{is often used to}} compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, the High Court has {{the power}} to issue {{prerogative}} <b>orders.</b> These include <b>mandatory</b> <b>orders</b> which have the effect of directing public authorities to take certain actions, prohibiting orders that forbid them from acting, and quashing orders that invalidate their acts or decisions. The High Court also {{has the power}} to grant declarations to strike down unconstitutional legislation.|$|R

25|$|Leave for a quashing order must {{generally}} be applied for {{within three months}} of the act or decision that is sought to be quashed. However, an application for leave can still be allowed if the applicant can account for the delay to the satisfaction of the court.

However, the High Court has held that such an application should be made without undue delay.|$|E

These regulations help to visualize the rhythm of the city: municipality issued orders which regulated the time for rest, trade, traffic, and street cleaning. Moreover, Kaunas city space was clearly divided by determining what was prohibited or obligatory to do in certain areas. For example, in the regulations for housing development and service arrangement, specific streets and areas are identified. The documents issued by Kaunas city municipality aimed at modernizing the city – the provisional capital of Lithuania. The orders dealt with the security of the dwellers, city arrangement, and protection against the contagions.

500|$|Even when a {{decision}} made by a body possesses some public element, judicial review of the decision may be ousted where a statute expressly excludes the court's power to review administrative decisions. However, the effectiveness of an ouster clause depends on the facts of each individual case.

To apply for a <b>mandatory</b> <b>order,</b> {{an applicant}} had to show a specific legal right in the matter. In contrast, an applicant only had to show that [...] "there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone" [...] to apply for a prohibiting or quashing order.

Relying on the above case, the High Court held {{that it could not}} grant a mandamus in such terms.
