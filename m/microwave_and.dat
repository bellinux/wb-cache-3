5|$|Early on August3, Colin's {{forward motion}} increased, and the cyclone {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August4, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses {{a process}} for selectively annealing heterostructures using microwaves. A heterostructure, comprised of a material having higher <b>microwave</b> absorption <b>and</b> a material having lower microwave absorption, is exposed to microwaves in the cavity. The higher microwave absorbing material absorbs the <b>microwaves</b> <b>and</b> selectively heats while the lower microwave absorbing material absorbs small amounts of <b>microwaves</b> <b>and</b> minimally heats. The higher microwave absorbing material is thereby annealed onto the less absorbing material which is thermally isolated...|$|R

25|$|A {{klystron}} is {{a specialized}} linear-beam vacuum tube. Klystrons {{are used as}} amplifiers at <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> radio frequencies to produce both low-power reference signals for superheterodyne radar receivers and to produce high-power carrier waves for communications and the driving force for modern particle accelerator.

It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwaves—those with exposed heating elements—can produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements.|$|E

25|$|A laser is {{a device}} that emits light (electromagnetic radiation) through a process called stimulated emission. The term laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Laser light is usually {{spatially}} coherent, {{which means that the}} light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Because the microwave equivalent of the laser, the maser, was developed first, devices that emit <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> radio frequencies are usually called masers.|$|E
25|$|Solar PV {{power is}} ideally suited for {{telecommunication}} {{applications such as}} local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, low power transmitters (LPT) are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.|$|E
25|$|After {{the turn}} of the century the Northern Pacific had a record of steady improvement. Together with the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific also gained control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, gaining {{important}} access to Chicago, the central Middle West and Texas, as well as the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, an important route through eastern and southern Washington. Its physical plant was upgraded continuously, with double-tracking in key areas, and automatic block signaling along its entire main line. This in turn gave way to centralized traffic control, <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> radio communications as time progressed.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states (electron paramagnetic resonance), molecular rotations, molecular vibration and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the <b>microwave</b> <b>and</b> millimeter-wave spectral regions; rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as fluorescence spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, <b>microwave,</b> <b>and</b> ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, {{as well as of}} developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic hyperthermia or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, it will be easier to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

In an effort to streamline operations, Brashs was split into Brashs, a company that sold audio systems, <b>microwaves</b> <b>and</b> compact discs, and Allans, which focused on musical instruments.
