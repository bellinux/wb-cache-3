5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an average {{diameter}} of 203±3.6km. There are few large Jupiter trojans {{in comparison to the}} overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84km, much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans are the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.|$|E
5|$|The large upper incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} right angle to the upper molars, and heavily {{pigmented}} with orange. Those of T.hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E
50|$|Bison {{have been}} {{observed}} to display homosexual behaviors, males much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> females. <b>In</b> the case of males, {{it is unlikely to}} be related to dominance, but rather to social bonding or gaining sexual experience.|$|R
50|$|Voice-mail {{recordings}} and closed-circuit television systems produce electronic evidence often used <b>in</b> litigation, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> today <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the past.

25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|Above {{all we had}} Dexter's captaincy. One-day cricket was {{his kind}} of game: it was instant and {{aggressive}} and its atmosphere brought {{out the best in}} him. He really became involved, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> county games. He even made a marked difference to our one day performances when he returned for a season of Sunday League games in the early 1970s.|$|E

25|$|At {{the highest}} social level, the Army of Flanders enjoyed a {{sequence}} of senior officers drawn from the nobility. Having senior noble commanders was considered extremely important in the Army, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> equivalent armies in Europe. At the lowest, the Army, {{like most of the}} period, had a substantial train of camp followers. Drawn from the lower classes, they made up {{a large percentage of the}} overall size of the Army in the field, and represented a considerable logistical burden in campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Many American women {{retained}} {{their domestic}} chores and often added a paid job, especially one {{related to a}} war industry. Much <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the previous war, large numbers of women were hired for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in munitions, and barriers against married women taking jobs were eased. The popular Rosie the Riveter icon became a symbol for a generation of American working women. In addition, some 300,000 women served in U.S. military uniform with organizations such as Women's Army Corps and WAVES. With many young men gone, sports organizers tried to set up professional women's teams, such as the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which closed after the war. After the war, most munitions plants closed, and civilian plants replaced their temporary female workers with returning veterans, who had priority.|$|E
25|$|Although critic Dennis Harvey {{found the}} script full of plot holes, {{they were no}} <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the average slasher film. He criticized the main {{character}} of Eddie as bland, but had good words for Andrew Levitas' performance as the hedonistic Chaz. Laura Kern found the dialogue corny, but had very positive words for the way each character was brought to life (which, she felt, {{made it all the}} more difficult to watch each person die). Critics Jeff Shannon and Peter Hartlaub also found the characters well-developed, and Hartlaub thought the performances by Dylan Fergus and Matt Phillips were the best in the film. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Wilmington similarly enjoyed the way the film presented the audience with various stereotypes (drag queen, leatherman, sex addict) and then killed them off, leaving the most fully realized character alive.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} perception of 'Europe' {{as a unit}} came during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades raided the European Union offices in Gaza, demanding apologies from Denmark and Norway. The protesting Palestinians evidently saw the cartoons as a 'European issue', <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> people <b>in</b> Europe itself, although the EU did ultimately issue a statement on the controversy.|$|R

30|$|On the whole, {{physicians}} felt rather {{confident about}} their survival estimates, ICU physicians <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> internists (<b>in</b> the ICU: mean 4.2 vs. 3.9, on the ward 4.2 vs. 3.8, both P[*]<[*] 0.001).

25|$|The German Palatinates {{who settled}} in Pennsylvania, erroneously {{known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands {{for a number of}} reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and {{economically}} they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.|$|E
25|$|Hindus {{have many}} sacred texts and {{different}} communities give special importance to different texts. Even <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> other religions, Hindus also foster disparate {{interpretations of the}} meaning of various texts. The Vedas, which form the foundation of Hinduism for many, do not refer explicitly to homosexuality, but Rigveda says regarding Samsara that Vikruti Evam Prakriti (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. People of a third gender (tritiya-prakriti), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the Puranas but are not specifically defined. In general they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexual identities.|$|E
500|$|After relegation {{back to the}} Fourth Division in 1970–71, the Gills {{were soon}} {{promoted}} back to the Third Division in the 1973–74 season. After this the club seemed to find its level in Division Three, regularly mounting a challenge for promotion which ultimately fell short each time, never <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 1986–87 {{when they reached the}} play-offs only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. [...] During this period the club produced future stars Steve Bruce and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of tracksuits.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the CEO of a US {{manufacturer}} {{commented that}} his company would not invest in a factory in France due to concerns over the productivity of local workers.

[...] He stated, [...] "...I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{appeared}} at the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes & Noble, in which she signed copies of the photo-book, dressed in a [...] "floral-print" [...] dress. Editors who commented on the book were positive about it. At E!, Marc Malkin praised Henwood's professional photography, which he deemed [...] "absolutely gorgeous". At Rap-Up, editors favored Rihanna's looks, writing that in the pictures, she was [...] "at the height of her beauty and ferocity". Rebecca Thomas of MTV had a similar opinion, stating: [...] "The 22-year-old stunner [...] shines {{in front of the}} camera and perhaps never <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the images that capture [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Pulvermacher {{patented}} {{the chain}} battery in the US in 1853. [...] This was soon {{followed by the}} wearable chain battery belt, or electric belt. [...] Electric belts became enormously popular in the US, far <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Europe. [...] This led to the company headquarters being moved to Cincinnati by the 1880s as the Pulvermacher Galvanic Company, but still calling themselves Pulvermacher's of London for the prestige of a European connection. [...] Early models had to be soaked in vinegar before use as in England, but later on models that worked purely by galvanic action with body sweat were introduced. [...] Since the device was being sold essentially as a quack cure it was only necessary to generate enough electricity that the wearer could feel it, no matter how slightly, and {{know that it was}} working.|$|E

500|$|... ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus {{is known}} {{from a single}} {{mandible}} with the incisor and three molars in it. Much {{of the back of}} the jaw is missing, including the angular, condyloid, and coronoid processes. The mental foramen, a foramen (opening) at the front of the jaw, in the diastema between the incisor and molars, opens upwards, a little <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the living marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). The masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles and are located on the outer surface of the mandible, are similar to those of Oryzomys. The molars are very worn, so that only traces of the cusps remain; no accessory small cusps are visible. Each of the teeth has two roots. The length of the toothrow is 3.6mm and the depth of the mandible below the first molar is also 3.6mm.|$|E
500|$|The {{pelvic girdle}} is well-preserved and well studied. In the holotype, the pelvic girdle is almost complete, only lacking the {{proximal}} ends of each ischium. The ilia of the holotype are well known, and show many distinct features. The pubic peduncle, where the ilium articulates with the pubis, {{is long and}} straight and has an expansion on the end, as in many sauropods. The upper edge of the iliac blade is curved and thick, with rugosities (rough spots) for cartilage attachment. The pubic elements are large and robust in adults, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> juveniles. They are flat when viewed from in front, and [...] when seen from behind. Lapparentosaurus resembles Patagosaurus when comparing their pubes. The ischia are much more gracile than the pubes, and only have a small distal expansion. While the ilia resemble Barapasaurus, and the pubes resemble Lapparentosaurus, the ischia are most similar to Diplodocus and Apatosaurus.|$|E
500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, <b>more</b> <b>so</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E
