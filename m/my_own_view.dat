She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, [...] "I am pretty outspoken and have <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> on every subject. So {{it will be a}} good platform for me to air my views." [...] Her first column, [...] "The changing face of Bollywood", published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site's ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, [...] "Odds stacked against Indian women", Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, [...] "Incidences like these take away a woman's dignity, her space and her freedom...why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?" [...] The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, [...] "The darkness that all actors fear", was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled [...] "Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand", described her two near-death experiences in late 2004.|$|E

My interest remains the achievement of a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts.” In response former U.S. Ambassador Parris has stated that the new U.S. administration had been “true to its public declarations of readiness to listen and be responsive to Turkish viewpoints and concerns”, before concluding that, “had the statement contained the word ‘genocide’, U.S.-Turkish relations would have gone into a deep freeze that would have taken years to thaw,” and although criticised Obama’s speech, “did no lasting harm.” ...|$|E

From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing—they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view,</b> when we [...] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2009 {{statement}} by U.S. President Barack Obama on Armenian Remembrance Day claimed that, [...] "reckoning {{with the past}} holds out a powerful promise of reconciliation," [...] before going on to state that, [...] "the best way to advance that goal right now is for the Armenian and Turkish people to address {{the facts of the}} past as part of their effort to move forward," [...] and reaffirming his strong support for [...] "efforts by the Turkish and Armenian people to work through this painful history {{in a way that is}} honest open and constructive," [...] but although, as previously indicated, US President Obama did not use the word ‘genocide’ his use of the Armenian term Meds Yeghern, translated as [...] "Great Crime" [...] or [...] "Calamity", managed to offend both sides of the dispute. Armenian groups felt betrayed at the reversal of promises of recognition made during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election whist Turkish authorities felt that Obama had gone back on promises made during the recent 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey. Despite not saying the word genocide, Obama made it clear that he had not changed his views about the Armenian Genocide in the statement, saying [...] "I have consistently stated <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of what occurred in 1915, and my view of that history has not changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making {{a big deal out of}} ratings, but <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E

60|$|It {{gives me}} pain, great pain, to {{communicate}} anything which I have even the remotest apprehension {{can give the}} slightest annoyance to you. I trust this will not do so; although I fear it may. But though fearing it may, I feel it is my duty to do it: because I have only these three alternatives before me. First, to delay communication to some subsequent opportunity: but as I have no fair prospect of being able then to convey a different statement, this plan would be attended with no advantage whatever, as far as I can see. Secondly, to dissemble my feelings: an alternative on which if I said another word I should be behaving undutifully and wickedly towards you. Thirdly, to follow the course I have now chosen, I trust with no feelings but those of the most profound affection, and of unfeigned grief {{that as far as}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> is concerned, I am unable to make it coincide with yours. I say, as far as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> goes, because I do not now see that <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> can or ought to stand for a moment in the way of your desires. In the hands of my parents, therefore, I am left. But lest you should be led to suppose that I have never reasoned with myself on this matter, but yielded to blind impulses or transitory whims, I will state, not indeed at length, but with as much simplicity and clearness as I am able, some of the motives which seem to me to urge me with an irresistible accumulation of moral force, to this conclusion, and this alone. In the first place, I would say that my own state and character is not one of them; nor, I believe, could any views of that character be compatible with their existence and reception, but that in which it now appears to me: namely, as one on which I can look with no degree of satisfaction whatever, and for the purification of which I can only direct my eyes and offer up my prayers to the throne of God.|$|E
60|$|Wicliffe's genius was, perhaps, {{not equal}} to Luther's; but really the more I know of him from Vaughan and Le Bas, both of whose books I like, I think him as {{extraordinary}} {{a man as}} Luther upon the whole. He was much sounder and more truly catholic in {{his view of the}} Eucharist than Luther. And I find, not without some pleasure, that <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of it, which I was afraid was original, was maintained in the tenth century, that is to say, that the body broken had no reference to the human body of Christ, but to the Caro Noumenon, or symbolical Body, the Rock that followed the Israelites.|$|E
60|$|When {{asked to}} give <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of the present and {{probable}} future influence of the Salvation Army upon the world, I feel in no danger of exaggeration. If any one could imagine what {{it has been for}} me to sit at its centre almost without intermission for more than thirty-five years, receiving continual reports of its development and progress in one nation after another, studying from within not only its strength and vitality, but its weaknesses and failures, and labouring to devise remedies and preventatives, until what was a little unknown Mission in the East End of London has become the widely, I might almost say, the universally recognized Army of to-day, he could perhaps understand something of my great confidence.|$|E

In the dark, I have brought you thus far. In the dark I am compelled to leave you, with my best respects.|$|E
60|$|Before {{ten more}} years had elapsed, the Neo-Darwinians were {{practically}} running current Science. It was 1906; I was fifty; I published <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of evolution {{in a play}} called Man and Superman; and I found that most people were unable to understand how I could be an Evolutionist and not a Neo-Darwinian, or why I habitually derided Neo-Darwinism as a ghastly idiocy, and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions. It was {{in the hope of}} making me clear the matter up that the Fabian Society, which was then organizing a series of lectures on Prophets of the Nineteenth Century, asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet Darwin. I did so; and scraps of that lecture, which was never published, variegate these pages.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} we reached the farmhouse, I had {{satisfied}} myself that there was nothing very serious the matter with me after all. The soft snow had broken the force of the concussion.

So when they laid me on the old-fashioned sofa in my little sitting-room, lighted a fire in the wide hearth, and covered me over with a few rugs, I felt comparatively happy and comfortable under the circumstances.
