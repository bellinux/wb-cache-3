40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{document}} a pronounced trend toward deconcentration of metropolitan employment during {{the postwar period}} in the United States. The employment share of initially more dense <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> declined and those of initially less dense <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> rose. Motivated by this finding, the authors develop a system-of-cities model in which increase in aggregate metropolitan employment causes employment to shift in favor of less dense <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> because congestion costs increase more rapidly for the initially more dense <b>metro</b> <b>areas.</b> A calibrated version of the model shows that the more-than-twofold increase in employment experienced by MSAs during the postwar period was indeed a powerful force favoring deconcentration.

40|$|As a group, the 10 major <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> of the Mountain West {{outperformed}} {{the national}} economy during {{the third quarter of}} 2014 on all four indicators of economic vitality measured by the Mountain Monitor: employment growth, output growth, unemployment, and house prices. In the three months ending in September, the country’s large metropolitan areas were anticipating the rapid uptick in national economic growth that took hold at the end of 2014. Mountain region <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> led the way. All but two major <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> in the region added jobs, and six did so at a faster rate than the country as a whole. As a result, employment across the 10 <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> increased by 0. 7 percent, compared to 0. 5 percent nationwide. This marked a sharp and welcome acceleration in the rate of job creation for the region. Denver enjoyed the fastest output growth in the country over the third quarter, and the value of all goods and services produced in the region’s <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> all together increased by 1. 1 percent—the second straight quarter of such strong growth. In a shift, Utah’s <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> appear to be ceding their position as the fastest growers in the region...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether the}} economic {{transformation in the}} United States during the 1990 s included the reduction of poverty in metropolitan (<b>metro)</b> <b>areas.</b> The authors investigate poverty change over the last business cycle, a period of overall strong economic growth. Their analysis identifies evidence of both poverty reduction and persistence. Findings show a general decline in poverty, with decline greatest in the <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> with the highest poverty rates {{at the beginning of}} the last business cycle. Yet the relatively strong economy did not move the <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> with the highest poverty from their relative position. The article documents that the underlying factors affecting metro-area poverty will have to be changed to fundamentally address poverty in high-poverty-rate <b>metro</b> <b>areas.</b> Reliance on changes in the macro economy will not be sufficient...|$|R
40|$|The quarter’s Mountain Monitor {{marks the}} {{four-year}} anniversary of Brookings Mountain West 2 ̆ 7 s quarterly tracking of the uneven pace of recovery across the major <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> of the Intermountain West and it finds that, although the region continues to outperform {{the national economy}} the rate of recovery slowed moderately in the region’s <b>metro</b> <b>areas.</b> As a group, Mountain region <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> advanced on all four indicators of economic recovery tracked by the Monitor—employment, output, unemployment, and house prices—but their progress was more restrained {{in the third quarter}} of 2013 than it was in the second. Beneath the regional headline of moderating growth, however, a number of noteworthy developments from individual <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> stand out. In sum, the region appeared to remain split at the close of the third quarter between those <b>metro</b> <b>areas</b> where the legacy of the Great Recession is fading steadily, such as Denver, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, and places such as Albuquerque, Colorado Springs, and Tucson that were still struggling to regain their footing after a brutal once-in-a-generation economic shock...|$|R

5|$|The Omaha Traction Company, which {{operated}} as the Street Railway Company, {{changed its}} name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952.
