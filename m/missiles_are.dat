5|$|The RAAF's Hornets {{have been}} fitted with several {{different}} types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal M61A1 cannon for use against air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with AIM-9M Sidewinder short range air-to-air missiles and AIM-7M Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles. The Sparrows were replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by ASRAAMs. The older <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> occasionally used in training exercises, however.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay itself {{requires}} Jetman {{to locate}} and destroy a series of alien bases {{on the surface of}} the moon. Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one. To accomplish this task, Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base—either in his space suit or using the rover—and then fly over the base and drop the bomb. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before the base is destroyed, two <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> launched from the base—one for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missiles whilst still in flight, thus preventing a game over.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
50|$|The Surya <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> an {{intercontinental}} ballistic <b>missile</b> speculated to <b>be</b> {{in development}} by India. As the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> {{yet to be}} developed, the specifications of the <b>missile</b> <b>are</b> not known and the entire program continues to remain highly secretive.|$|R
50|$|Strela-2M <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{available}} to Argentinian {{troops in the}} Falkland Islands during the Falklands War. War Machine Encyclopedia gives no launch recorded, but several <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> captured. The <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> supplied by Libya.|$|R
2500|$|... 15 ASM-135 ASAT <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} and 5 <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> flight tested.|$|R
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. <b>Missiles</b> <b>are</b> fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
50|$|The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} tested without {{control and}} guidance systems on 9 May to 12 May 2003. The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> again successfully tested on 25 March 2007. On 27 March, vertical {{launch of the}} <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> carried out, suggesting {{the use of the}} missile as a long-range surface-to-air missile for the Indian Navy to arm its destroyers and frigates and for the Indian Air Force. The ground testing of the Astra <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> successful. The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> successfully tested on 13 September 2008.|$|R
50|$|A further {{test of the}} AEGIS {{system was}} {{conducted}} on 13 June, when two Medium Range Target <b>Missiles</b> <b>were</b> launched from Barking Sands. The <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> tracked by US Navy destroyers, and simulated SM-3 <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> launched to intercept them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{retired and}} removed {{beginning}} in January 1965 {{in favor of}} the more advanced LGM-25C Titan II; last <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> taken off-line on 17 February; squadron was inactivated on 25 June. <b>Missile</b> sites <b>were</b> later sold off to private ownership after demilitarization.|$|R
25|$|Advanced fighter {{aircraft}} and {{surface to air}} <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> being made available to potentially hostile states.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to radar-guided missiles, IR-guided <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> {{very difficult to}} find as they approach aircraft. They do not emit detectable radar, and they are generally fired from a rear visual-aspect, directly toward the engines. In most cases, pilots {{have to rely on}} their wingmen to spot the missile's smoke trail and alert them. Since IR-guided <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> inherently far shorter-legged in distance and altitude range than their radar-guided counterparts, good situational awareness of altitude and potential threats continues to be an effective defense. More advanced electro-optical systems can detect missile launches automatically from the distinct thermal emissions of a missile's rocket motor.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{operates}} their missiles from {{a shared}} pool, {{together with the}} Atlantic squadron of the U.S.Navy Ohio-class SSBNs at King's Bay, Georgia. The pool is 'co-mingled' and <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> selected at random for loading on to either nation's submarines.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, the Milan <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> first {{adapted to}} be fired by {{commander}} from his open hatch, and between 1977 and 1979 Milan <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fitted to army vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{gradually}} {{replaced by}} RSD-10 Pioneers, {{and by the}} mid 1980s most had {{been taken out of}} service. The last <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> scrapped on August 9, 1989.|$|R
50|$|The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> retired {{beginning}} in July, 1967, {{with the final}} missile removed from inventory in 1970. Five hundred <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> produced during {{the life of the}} weapon program.|$|R
25|$|The {{maximum range}} of fire against {{ballistic}} missiles is 20km, and the maximum target speed is 1200 m / s. Its capacity of protecting against ballistic <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> comparable {{with that of}} the Patriot PAC-2. However, the height is less.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, {{thousands}} of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition {{wants to see}} an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies {{should be used for}} health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the Faslane Naval Base, where Trident <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> stored.|$|E
25|$|Infrared shoulder-fired <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to home-in on a heat source on an aircraft, typically the engine exhaust plume, and detonate a warhead {{in or near}} the heat source to disable the aircraft. These missiles use passive guidance, meaning that they do not emit signals to detect a heat source, which makes them difficult to detect by targeted aircraft employing countermeasure systems.|$|E
50|$|The Block 1 <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{designated}} AGM/RGM/UGM-84A in US {{service and}} UGM-84B in the UK. Block 1B standard <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> designated AGM/RGM/UGM-84C, Block 1C <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> designated AGM/RGM/UGM-84D. Block 1 used a terminal attack mode {{that included a}} pop-up to approximately 1800 m before diving on the target; Block 1B omitted the terminal pop-up; and Block 1C provided a selectable terminal attack mode.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{retired and}} removed in late 1964 {{in favor of}} the more {{advanced}} LGM-25C Titan II; the last <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> taken offline on 4 January 1965, and the squadron was inactivated on 25 March. <b>Missile</b> sites <b>were</b> later sold off to private ownership after demilitarization.|$|R
50|$|The Zeus <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> enhanced, and {{the shorter}} range Sprint <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{added to the}} Nike defense system, then called Nike-X. The system {{included}} large powerful radars and a computer complex.|$|R
25|$|The Hawk 200 {{can launch}} many NATO {{standard}} guided missiles including AIM-9L Sidewinder AAM, ASRAAM AAM, AIM-120 AMRAAM AAM, AGM-65 Maverick AGM, Sea Eagle AShM and Sting Ray homing torpedoes. The Hawk 200 can also carry {{a variety of}} bombs, including 113kg bombs, 240kg bombs, 540kg bombs and Paveway II guided bombs. The AIM-9L Sidewinder <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> launched from the wingtip air-to-air missile stations on each wing.|$|E
25|$|The Trident missile is a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered {{ballistic missile}} submarines (SSBNs). Trident <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> carried by fourteen US Navy s, with US warheads, and four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The missile {{is named after}} the mythological trident of Neptune.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy {{currently}} has 18 s deployed, of which 14 are ballistic missile submarines. Each submarine {{is equipped with}} a maximum complement of 24 Trident II missiles. Approximately 12 U.S. attack submarines were equipped to launch nuclear Tomahawk missiles, but these weapons were removed from service by 2013. Sea-launch weapons make up the majority of weapons declared under START II rules. Some Trident <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> equipped with the W88 warhead.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Harpoon <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{used by the}} U.S. to {{sink the}} [...] during Operation Praying Mantis. Another was fired at the Kaman-class missile boat Joshan, but failed to strike because the fast attack craft had already been mostly sunk by RIM-66 Standard missiles. An Iranian-owned Harpoon <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> also fired at the guided missile cruiser [...] The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} lured away by chaff.|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, during Velayete-90 wargames, a Noor <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{tested with}} {{improvements}} in electronic systems, a more jam-resistant radar and better target acquisition algorithms. A Qader <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> also {{tested in the}} wargame.|$|R
50|$|In May 1944, 59 Hs 117 <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> tested, {{some from}} beneath a Heinkel He 111; {{over half the}} trials failed. Mass {{production}} was ordered in December 1944, with deployment to start in March 1945. Operational <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> to be launched from a 37mm gun carriage.|$|R
25|$|Nuclear warheads {{from the}} Trident <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> transported by road convoy {{several times a}} year from Coulport to Burghfield for refurbishment. Between 2000 and 2016 there were 180 {{accidents}} involving the vehicles, ranging from minor traffic accidents to a sudden total loss of power in one of the 44-tonne lorries that halted a convoy and caused a double lane closure and a tailback on the M6 motorway. The accidents have been more frequent in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Supersonic anti-ship {{missiles}} {{have been}} a key development in China. The Russian ramjet SS-N-22 Sunburn is operated by China on board its Sovremenny class destroyers. Its high velocity supersonic approach and its large warhead make the SS-N-22 a valuable weapon for the PLAN. China has long sought to produce its own supersonic and eventually hypersonic anti-ship system since the 1980s. High speed <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> seen as {{the most effective means}} of attacking modern warships. Only Russia, China, and India (Brahmos, which was co-developed with Russia) have so far successfully developed and deployed such weapons.|$|E
25|$|Train-based ICBMs do {{offer some}} {{advantages}} over missiles in fixed silos, namely {{that the enemy}} can never be sure where they are—or, more accurately, where {{all of them are}} at any given moment. But as a 2014 RAND study pointed out, rail and truck launchers have their drawbacks. Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates. In addition, because there are {{only a limited number of}} rail lines and highways in an area, enemy surveillance can focus on a few areas. And, once located, mobile <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> more vulnerable than ICBMs in hardened silos.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{ended in}} 1987, and the missile entered service with the German Navy in 1991. Approximately 140 <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} for Germany. The <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> now in service with the German Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force.|$|R
25|$|The SLAM-ER {{obtained}} initial {{operating capability}} in June 2000. A total of three SLAM-ER <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fired by the U.S. Navy during the Iraq War, and the <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> also used during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|The first strategic-missile unit became {{operational}} on 9 February 1959 at Plesetsk in north-west Russia. On 15 December 1959 the R-7 <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{tested at}} Plesetsk {{for the first}} time. The <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fully deployed by 1962.|$|R
