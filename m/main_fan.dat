500|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} stage, the team reviewed how fans and critics {{had responded to}} Awakening. While the gameplay and graphics were positively received, the story had been criticized for its quality by the <b>main</b> <b>fan</b> base, even though new players approved of it. To that end, they decided {{to write a story}} that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers. The concept of the story changing depending on which protagonists the main character sided with, originated from Yamagami's memories of the , which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change the story. Wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil, the team decided to create multiple versions of the game. Initially, the plan was just for a choice between one kingdom or the other, but Yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen, so a third version of the game was planned. The game's Japanese title, [...] "If", came from the sheer number of choices featured for players in the game. The English title [...] "Fates" [...] referred to the concept of the main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side. After the creation of the three storylines, the team needed to make the decision to divide Birthright and Conquest into separate physical releases. This was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising the game's price to the equivalent of a two-game bundle, which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version. Another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add the other versions on as cheaper downloadable content (DLC). This opened up the option for players to run through the game until the crucial decision point in Chapter 5, then buy the alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices. Each route was estimated to have the same amount of gameplay and story content as Awakening.|$|E

500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the <b>main</b> <b>fan</b> websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if someone were to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{propeller}} fans in underground drift stone mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either <b>main</b> mine <b>fans</b> or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane <b>main</b> mine <b>fan</b> that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original <b>main</b> mine <b>fan</b> system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

50|$|GE took a {{different}} approach with their first high bypass ratio turbofan, the TF39. A unique, very complex design; the T-stage, which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the <b>main</b> <b>fan</b> rotor. The T-stage itself comprises an overhung mini-rotor followed {{by a set of}} outlet guide vanes; the <b>main</b> <b>fan</b> rotor is located immediately behind these OGV's. Outboard of the T-stage rotor are the main inlet guide vanes, which only affect the bypass stream. The T-stage rotor extends to about half the main rotor stage annulus and runs in a tip shroud. The <b>main</b> <b>fan</b> stage has a mid-span platform/flow splitter which separates the single-stage outer annulus from the 2-stage inner annulus. These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor. However, a fair proportion of the air entering the T-stage is bled off into the bypass duct, there being two annular passages leading to the bypass duct. The nominal bypass ratio of 8:1 must refer to the ratio of total bypass mass flow to HP compressor entry mass flow.|$|E

40|$|During a {{mine fire}} or other emergency, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to reverse the airflow {{in order to provide}} an escapeway or to isolate a fire. Also, (in colder areas, the airflow may be reversed to prevent ice buildup. When reversing <b>main</b> mine <b>fans,</b> the mine operator usually does not know what operating characteristics of flow and pressure to expect. Laboratory a field tests of vane axial <b>main</b> mine <b>fans</b> in the 7 - to 9 -ft diameter size range were conducted to establish forward and reverse performance characteristics under controlled conditions and at typical mine installations. The data obtained suggest that reverse performance characteristics are dependent upon the blade angle and the hub to tip ratio. There is also evidence that reverse performance can be predicted for a family of blade angles and a given hub to tip ratio. Generally, quantity of air is 30 % to 65 % less in reverse than when operating in the normal forward mode...|$|R

40|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) {{investigated}} ways {{to increase}} mine airflow to underground metal/nonmetal (M/NM) mine working areas to improve miners' health and safety. One of those areas is controlled recirculation. Because the quantity of mine air often cannot be increased, reusing part of the ventilating air {{can be an effective}} alternative, if implemented properly, until the capacity of the present system is improved. The additional airflow can be used to provide effective dilution of contaminants and higher flow velocities in the underground mine environment. Most applications of controlled recirculation involve taking a portion of the return air and passing it back into the intake to increase the air volume delivered to the desired work areas. OMSHR investigated a Nevada gold mine where shaft rehabilitation was in progress and one of the two <b>main</b> <b>fans</b> was shut down to allow reduced air velocity for safe shaft work. Underground booster fan operating pressures were kept constant to maintain airflow to work areas, inducing controlled recirculation in one work zone. Investigation into system behavior and the effects of recirculation on the working area during times of reduced primary ventilation system airflow would provide additional information on implementation of controlled recirculation into the system and how these events affect M/NM ventilation systems. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health monitored the ventilation district when both <b>main</b> <b>fans</b> were operating and another scenario with one of the units turned off for maintenance. Airflow and contaminants were measured to determine the exposure effects of induced recirculation on miner health. Surveys showed that 19 % controlled recirculation created no change in the overall district airflow distribution and a small reduction in district fresh air intake. Total dust levels increased only modestly and respirable dust levels were also low. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) levels showed a high increase in district intake mass flow, but minor increases in exposure levels related to the recirculation percentage. Utilization of DPM mass flow rates allows input into ventilation modeling programs to better understand and plan for ventilation changes and district recirculation effects on miners' health.
