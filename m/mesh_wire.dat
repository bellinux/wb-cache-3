[...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E

5000|$|Wire decking is {{commonly}} used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the rack structure. <b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> decking comes in various thicknesses and <b>mesh</b> dimensions. <b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of {{the holes in the}} <b>mesh.</b> Most <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this waterfall decking, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. Reverse waterfall decking can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system.

Stackpole went through 50 renditions before settling upon the final model which was 10 ft tall. The model was then divided into cross sections.

Iron was used for supports, bent and shaped around the proper contours of the statue. Next, <b>mesh</b> <b>wire</b> was layered over the entire iron frame, and then covered in a final blanket of plaster. Such a construction was always meant for temporary placement.|$|E

50|$|Spot welding is {{typically}} used when welding particular types of sheet metal, welded <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> or <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Thicker stock {{is more difficult}} to spot weld because the heat flows into the surrounding metal more easily. Spot welding can be easily identified on many sheet metal goods, such as metal buckets. Aluminium alloys can be spot welded, but their much higher thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity requires higher welding currents. This requires larger, more powerful, and more expensive welding transformers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flame {{stability}} of gaseous fuel inside meso-scale combustor with double <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was investigated experimentally. Combustor {{was made from}} quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 3, 5 mm and an outer diameter of 5 mm. Two pieces of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were made from stainless steel inserted at 10 and 13 mm {{from the end of}} combustor. Propane was used as fuel in this research. Flame was stabilized in the region between two <b>wire</b> <b>meshes.</b> The flame has a blue luminosity, indicate no soot formation condition. However, the second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and combustor wall has red luminousity at high velocity reactant, indicate that they have high temperature and emmited heat radiation. Meso-scale combustor with double <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> has broader flame stability area if compared to combustor with single <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Extention of this region occured toward lower equivalence ratio for lean fuel mixture, as well as toward higher equivalence ratio for rich fuel mixture. The most important extention region of flame stability area is toward higher reactant flow rate. It was caused by existing of second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> which has function to prevent occurence of blow–off at relatively high reactant flow rate, as well as to increase heat recirculation to unburnt reactant as a results of higher wall temperature...|$|R

The wire gauze is made of a [...] This type of material provides long life expectancy and can be used over and over again without a risk of it being torn. The sides/corners of the wire gauze are turned inward to help prevent fraying, improve handling and reduce safety risk from protruding ends of wire. The wire gauze is an important piece of supporting equipment in a laboratory because beakers or any type of glassware cannot be heated directly with a flame from the Bunsen burner, and the wire gauze will help protect the glassware. There are two types of wire gauze: woven wire gauze and a wire gauze with a ceramic center. These two types of wire gauze that are made of metal have the same ability to transmit the heat efficiently, but the gauze with a ceramic center will allow the heat to be dispersed more evenly. The ceramic {{at the center of the}} wire gauze is enmeshed at high pressure to prevent it from peeling. There are three sizes of wire gauze with ceramic center: 4 inches, 5 inches, and 6 inches, so that different sizes of glassware can be accommodated.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{economic}} gains, emigration still continued. By 1961, 1.65 {{million people}} had {{fled to the}} west. Fearful of the possible consequences of this continued outflow of refugees, and aware of the dangers an East German collapse would present to the Soviet Union’s Communist satellite empire, Ulbricht pressured Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in early 1961 to stop the outflow and resolve the status of Berlin. During this time, the refugees’ mood was rarely expressed in words, though East German laborer Kurt Wismach did so effectively by shouting for free elections during one of Ulbricht’s speeches. When Khrushchev approved {{the building of a}} wall as a means to resolve this situation, Ulbricht threw himself into the project with abandon. Delegating different tasks in the process while maintaining overall supervision and careful control of the project, Ulbricht managed to keep secret the purchase of vast amounts of building materials, including barbed wire, concrete pillars, timber, and <b>mesh</b> <b>wire.</b> On 13 August 1961, work began on what was to become the Berlin Wall, only two months after Ulbricht had emphatically denied that there were such plans ("Nobody has the intention of building a wall"), thereby mentioning the word wall for the very first time. Ulbricht deployed GDR soldiers and police to seal the border with West Berlin overnight. The mobilization included 8,200 members of the People’s Police, 3,700 members of the mobile police, 12,000 factory militia members, and 4,500 State Security officers. Ulbricht also dispersed 40,000 East German soldiers across the country to suppress any potential protests. Once the wall was in place, Berlin went from being the easiest place to cross the border between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.|$|E
