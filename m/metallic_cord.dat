50|$|The thread {{used for}} {{stitching}} may be wool, silk, cotton or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers {{may also be}} used, such as <b>metallic</b> <b>cord,</b> metallic braid, ribbon, or raffia. Stitches may be plain, covering just one thread intersection with a single orientation, or fancy, such as in bargello or other counted-thread stitches. Plain stitches, known as tent stitches, may be worked as basketweave, continental or half cross. Basketweave uses the most wool, but does not distort the rectangular mesh and makes for the best-wearing piece.|$|E
5000|$|Frogs and {{frogging}} {{became an}} important decorative feature on military uniforms from the 17th-19th centuries. This was particular evident for prestigious regiments, especially cavalry or hussars, and {{gave rise to the}} German term for frogging in general, 'Husarentressen'. These dolman jackets were tight-fitting and dominated by extensive frogging, often in luxurious materials such as gold, silver or brass <b>metallic</b> <b>cording</b> or brocades.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{system of}} warfare was {{substantially}} {{that of the}} Celts of this period, who no longer fought, as the Italian Celts had formerly done, bareheaded and with merely sword and dagger, but with copper helmets often richly adorned and with a peculiar missile weapon, the materis; the large sword was retained and the long narrow shield, along with which they probably wore also a coat of mail. They were not destitute of cavalry; but the Romans were superior to them in that arm. Their order of battle was as formerly a rude phalanx professedly drawn up with just as many ranks in depth as in breadth, the first rank of which in dangerous combats not unfrequently tied together their <b>metallic</b> girdles with <b>cords.</b>|$|R
