500|$|In mid-2007, Hornish drove Penske's No. 27 Dodge Charger in an ARCA Re/Max Series race at Michigan International Speedway. Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of people have asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and doing these stock car races, and really it's the fact I don't get much practice time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can you explain to <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E
