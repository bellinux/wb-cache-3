A reference gas cell is connected an InGaAs photodetector for detecting the absorption intensity peak {{caused by the}} gas to calibrate the gas absorption center using distributed feedback laser diode (DFB-LD) with sawtooth wave driver current. The gas absorption wavelength calibration and gas sensing operations are conducted at a special internal to eliminate the wavelength shift of DFB-LD caused by the ambient fluctuations. Compared with the conventional wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), this method uses a lower lock-in amplifier bandwidth and averaging algorithm to improve signal noise ratio (SNR). Water vapor is chosen as a sample gas to evaluate its performance. In the experiments, the impact of sawtooth wave frequency and lock-in amplifier bandwidth on the harmonic signal is analyzed, and the wavelength-calibration technique-based system achieves a <b>minimum</b> <b>detection</b> <b>limit</b> (<b>MDL)</b> of 790 ppbv and SNR with 13.4 improvement factor compared with the conventional WMS system.|$|E

Ten different water samples were taken from different parts of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti region of Ghana and analyzed for physicochemical parameters including pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity total hardness and coliform bacteria. Metals and anions analyzed were Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, NO 3 −, NO 2 −, SO 4 2 -, PO 4 2 −, F− and Cl−. Bacteria analysed were total coliform and Escherichia coli.

We propose a new methodology for on-site and rapid evaluation of heavy-atom contamination in wounds using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) device. In the present study, stable lead was used as the model contaminant substitute for radioactive heavy atoms. First, the wound model was developed by placing a liquid blood phantom on an epoxy resin wound phantom contaminated with lead. Next, the correlation between the concentration of contaminant and the XRF peak intensity was formulated considering the thickness of blood exiting the wound. Methods to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>detection</b> <b>limit</b> (<b>MDL)</b> of contaminants at any maximal equivalent dose to the wound by XRF measurement were also established. For example, in this system, at a maximal equivalent dose of 16. 5 mSv to the wound and blood thickness of 0. 5 mm, the MDL value for lead was 1. 2 ppm (3. 1 nmol). The radioactivity of 239 Pu corresponding to 3. 1 nmol is 1. 7 kBq, which is lower than the radioactivity of 239 Pu contaminating puncture wounds in previous severe accidents. In conclusion, the established methodology could be beneficial for future development of a method to evaluate plutonium contamination in wounds.

All MAE factors affecting the extraction techniques (heating, pressure, power, time and solvent volume) of the targeted compounds were studied through experimental design to obtain a simple MAE method and evaluate the optimum extraction condition compared with traditional Soxhlet method for soil samples. The tested pesticide residues in the extracts of both techniques were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The results were compared for the percentage of recovery, time consumption and volume of organic solvent used in each extraction procedure. The results indicated that the MAE method had the advantages resulting from the use of a low volume of organic solvent (acetone: hexane, 3 : 2), an unnecessary cleanup step and good efficiency to extract different groups of pesticides in soils at residual levels in 20 min, this compared with Soxhlet method.

Through the 1980 s and 1990 s, there were two vendors who supplied and supported these instruments.

The largest NSE user of this capability is the Savannah River Site (SRS), located near Aiken, South Carolina. The Research and Development Engineering (R&DE) Group in the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) investigated the areas of instrument support that were needed to extend {{the life cycle of}} these aging instruments. Their conclusions, as to the focus areas of electromagnetic sector mass spectrometers to address, in order of priority, were electronics, software and hardware. Over the past 3 - 5 years, the R&DE Group has designed state of the art electronics and software that will allow high resolution legacy mass spectrometers, critical to the NNSA mission, to be operated for the foreseeable future. The funding support for this effort has been from several sources, including the SRS Defense Programs, NNSA Readiness Campaign, Pantex Plant and Sandia National Laboratory.

40|$|Elemental carbon (EC) is an {{important}} constituent of atmospheric particulate matter because it absorbs solar radiation influencing climate and visibility and it adversely affects human health. The EC measured by thermal methods such as thermal–optical reflectance (TOR) is operationally defined as the carbon that volatilizes from quartz filter samples at elevated temperatures {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Here, methods are presented to accurately predict TOR EC using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorbance spectra from atmospheric particulate matter collected on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or Teflon) filters. This method is similar to the procedure developed for OC in prior work (Dillner and Takahama, 2015). Transmittance FT-IR analysis is rapid, inexpensive and nondestructive to the PTFE filter samples which are routinely collected for mass and elemental analysis in monitoring networks. FT-IR absorbance spectra are obtained from 794 filter samples from seven Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) sites collected during 2011. Partial least squares regression is used to calibrate sample FT-IR absorbance spectra to collocated TOR EC measurements. The FT-IR spectra are divided into calibration and test sets. Two calibrations are developed: one developed from uniform distribution of samples across the EC mass range (Uniform EC) and one developed from a uniform distribution of Low EC mass samples (EC < 2. 4 μg, Low Uniform EC). A hybrid approach which applies the Low EC calibration to Low EC samples and the Uniform EC calibration to all other samples is used to produce predictions for Low EC samples that have mean error on par with parallel TOR EC samples in the same mass range and an estimate of the <b>minimum</b> <b>detection</b> <b>limit</b> (<b>MDL)</b> that is on par with TOR EC MDL. For all samples, this hybrid approach leads to precise and accurate TOR EC predictions by FT-IR as indicated by high coefficient of determination (R 2; 0. 96), no bias (0. 00 μg m − 3, a concentration value based on the nominal IMPROVE sample volume of 32. 8 m 3), low error (0. 03 μg m − 3) and reasonable normalized error (21 %). These performance metrics can be achieved with various degrees of spectral pretreatment (e. g., including or excluding substrate contributions to the absorbances) and are comparable in precision and accuracy to collocated TOR measurements. Only the normalized error is higher for the FT-IR EC measurements than for collocated TOR. FT-IR spectra are also divided into calibration and test sets by the ratios OC/EC and ammonium/EC to determine the impact of OC and ammonium on EC prediction. We conclude that FT-IR analysis with partial least squares regression is a robust method for accurately predicting TOR EC in IMPROVE network samples, providing complementary information to TOR OC predictions (Dillner and Takahama, 2015) and the organic functional group composition and organic matter estimated previously from the same set of sample spectra (Ruthenburg et al., 2014) ...|$|E

40|$|Having {{established}} <b>detection</b> <b>limits</b> for {{transition elements}} exceeding current {{requirements of the}} semiconductor industry, our recent efforts at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) {{have focused on the}} improvement of the detection sensitivity for light elements such as Al. Data analysis is particularly challenging for Al, due to the presence of the neighboring Si signal from the substrate. <b>Detection</b> <b>limits</b> can be significantly improved by tuning the excitation energy below the Si-K absorption edge. For conventional TXRF systems this can be done by using a W-Mα fluorescence line (1. 78 keV) for excitation. At a synchrotron radiation facility energy tunability is available. However, in both cases this results in a substantial increase in background due to resonant x-ray Raman scattering. This scattering dominates the background under the Al Kα fluorescence line, and consequently limits the achievable sensitivity for the detection of Al surface contaminants. In particular, we find that for a precise determination of the achievable sensitivity, the specific shape of the continuous Raman background {{must be taken into account}} in the data analysis. The data deconvolution presented here opens a new perspective for conventional TXRF systems to mitigate this background limitation. This results in a <b>minimum</b> <b>detection</b> <b>limit</b> of 2. 4 x 109 atoms /cm 2 for Al. 1 Based on these results it will also be demonstrated that by improving the detector resolution, the <b>minimum</b> <b>detection</b> <b>limit</b> can be improved significantly.
