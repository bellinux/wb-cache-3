5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian {{cultures}} and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to {{concerns about the}} hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings {{diagnosed with cancer}} and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of cancer pain, {{it is not possible}} to recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced {{in the course}} of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Ficus aurea is edible {{and was used}} for food by the {{indigenous}} people and early settlers in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as a backyard source of native fruit.

F. aurea was also used in traditional <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Bahamas and Florida.

5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice <b>medicine.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine {{has also}} gained notability.

In QS World University Rankings' broad subject rankings, the {{university}} placed 55th in the world, and fourth in Canada for the field of life sciences and <b>medicine.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> QS rankings for medicine, McMaster's medical school was ranked 35th in the world, and fourth in Canada. In the ARWU 2016 rankings for the field of clinical medicine and pharmacy, the university ranked 33rd {{in the world and}} second in Canada. In U.S. News & World Report 2017 rankings for clinical medicine, the university placed 44th in the world, and third in Canada. In Maclean's 2017 national rankings of universities by subject, McMaster was ranked fourth in Canada in both the fields of medicine, and in nursing. According to a 2013 Maclean's survey with first-year medical students who obtained a Canadian undergraduate degree, 10.5 percent of these students attended McMaster for their undergraduate education, the most out of any undergraduate institution in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.|$|E
