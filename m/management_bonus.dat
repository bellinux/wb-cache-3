40|$|This {{laboratory}} experiment investigates {{the effects of}} a performance incentive scheme and financial audit threats on transfer price negotiations. Three hypotheses are developed, based on a review of transfer pricing, budget-goal setting, incentive, and auditing literatures. Experimental data are gathered over multiple periods of negotiations from forty-eight students, and are analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA. The outcome measured is firm profits. The results show that bonus incentive scheme and audit threats have no effect on firm profits. However, the interaction between the performance based bonus incentive scheme and an audit threat is significant. With both <b>management</b> controls, <b>bonus</b> incentive and audit threats, firm profits are significantly lower than under a bonus incentive scheme only. Possible reasons for these results are explored in the discussion section. In a deflationary pricing environment, study findings have implications for designing a negotiated transfer pricing mechanism in the presence of performance based incentive schemes and financial audit threats...|$|R

40|$|In 1983 Korea {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} way it managed {{the largest and most}} important group of its public enterprises, or GIEs. The reforms increased enterprise autonomy, changed managerial selection procedures, and began systematically to evaluate performance and provide incentives {{on the basis of the}} evaluation. This paper assesses the results of these reforms and suggests ways the Korean performance evaluation system might be adapted to cicumstances in other countries. A central feature of the Korean reforms is the performance evaluation system, which sets clear targets for <b>management</b> and provides <b>bonuses</b> on the basis of outcomes. The system has four essential prerequisites for success : 1) parallel reforms to increase managerial autonomy and skills, 2) reliable and timely information, 3) adequate skills to supervise and evaluate, and 4) political will. This paper suggests ways to build up and compensate for the first three requirement; there is no substitute for the fourth.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether banks manage earnings through derivative activities. Under SFAS No. 119, trading and non-trading derivatives are accounted for differently. Trading purpose derivatives are measured {{at fair value}} with gains or losses recognized in earnings. While non-trading purpose derivatives need not be recognized in the financial statements, their fair values have to be disclosed in the footnotes. This difference in accounting treatment provides banks an opportunity to manage earnings by manipulating derivative classification. ^ Tests for earnings management are conducted by regressing the discretionary components of fair value changes of trading and non-trading derivatives on proxies for earnings management incentives. These incentives include earnings smoothing, avoidance of debt-covenant violation, loss aversion, and bonus maximization. Consistent with prior literature (McNichols and Wilson, 1988; Guidry et al., 1998), the discretionary components are first estimated indirectly using a separate model. ^ Empirical results indicate that banks engage in earnings management to smooth reported earnings and to avoid reporting losses. There is also partial evidence of earnings <b>management</b> to maximize <b>bonus</b> awards. These results suggest inadequacy in current accounting standards, and support the ongoing efforts of the FASB and the SEC to improve the accounting for and disclosure of derivatives. ...|$|R

Summers would retain both title {{for more than}} a year after the merger, and Clutterbuck would become President in 1998.

[...] Later, Summers would pass the CEO mantle to Clutterbuck in 2000 but would remain chairman. [...] Although very popular with the rank-and-file, Clutterbuck's constant battles with the bank to preserve the McD culture made him no friends in Key Tower. Moreover, Clutterbuck refused to forgo his minimum annual bonus for 2001, despite the decision by the rest of Key's senior <b>management</b> to forsake <b>bonuses</b> following a difficult operating year. Thus, Clutterbuck received $1.289 million bonus pursuant to employment agreement signed as part of the merger, according to KeyCorp's 2002 proxy statement. This led to his quick demise.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Navy's Selective Reenlistment <b>Bonus</b> <b>Management</b> System (SRBMS) uses a model known as ROGER {{to identify the}} SRB-eligible population and to predict the number of SRB takers for the following fiscal year. The Enlisted Bonus Manager uses the ROGER model to determine the SRB plans during the execution year. Over the years, constant changes {{in the structure of}} the SRB program have led to increasing levels of predictive error in the ROGER model. Specifically, the ROGER model has routinely under-identified the SRB-eligible population, which, in turn, led to under-predictions in the size of the predicted number of SRB takers and the SRB budget. One of the reasons for the underpredictions is the ROGER model does not account for sailors who acquire an SRB-eligible NEC during the execution year. The objective of this thesis is to determine whether the predictive errors in the Navy's SRBMS (ROGER) model can be reduced by accounting for new NEC/skill acquisition by sailors each fiscal year. NEC/skill acquisitions are accounted for by incorporating data into the ROGER model from the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) on annual school enrollments and graduations. This thesis analyzes the impact of adding the NETC skill acquisition data to the ROGER model by analyzing the predicted SRB-eligible population and the predicted number of SRB takers and by assessing the resulting impact on the predicted SRB budget.

40|$|While most {{academic}} and practitioner researchers {{agree that a}} country’s commercial banking sector’s soundness is a very significant indicator of a country’s financial market health, there is considerably less agreement and substantial confusion surrounding what constitutes a healthy bank {{in the aftermath of}} 2007 + financial crisis. Global banks’ balance sheets, corporate governance, <b>management</b> compensation and <b>bonuses,</b> toxic assets, and risky behavior are all under scrutiny as academics and regulators alike are trying to quantify what are “healthy, safe and good practices” for these various elements of banking. The current need to quantify, measure, evaluate, and compare is driven by the desire to spot troubled banks, “bad and risky” behavior, and prevent real damage and contagion in the financial markets, investors, and tax payers {{as it did in the}} recent crisis. Moreover, future financial crisis has taken on a new urgency as vast amounts of capital flows (over $ 1 trillion) are being redirected to emerging markets. This study differs from existing methods in the literature as it entail designing, constructing, and validating a critical dimension of financial innovation in respect to the eight developing countries in the South Asia region as well as eight countries in emerging Europe at the country level for the period 2001 – 2008, with regional and systemic differentials taken into account. Preliminary findings reveal that higher stages of payment systems development have generated efficiency gains by reducing the settlement risk and improving financial intermediation; such efficiency gains are viewed as positive financial innovations and positively impact the banking soundness.

40|$|Nowadays the Financial Statements are {{regarded}} as not only the indicators of operating performance for the corporations, but also important references for investors. However, there are several motives for the managers to do earnings <b>management</b> such as <b>Bonus</b> Plan, Political Costs, Debt Covenants, IPO, SEO and so on. The consequences of earnings management may mislead the investors and {{cause a lot of}} social costs. Thus, there are many researches conducted in building accrual models for detecting earnings management. To increase the R 2 of the first stage regression model, we cluster the companies by using financial ratios and company size of enterprises to form the homogeneous groups. In other words, this study is trying to construct the earnings management detecting model by using a data set with more homogeneity through the extra clustering stage based on the traditional approach. In order to compare the performances of three different data segmenting methods, we use the cross-sectional version of Modified Jones Model and performance matched Modified Jones Model to construct six cross-sectional accruals models. Then we compare the R 2, type I error, and the power of these six models. The empirical results show that the R 2 of the models using clustering method are better than those of the other models. All models are well-specified under random samples and stratified subsets. Furthermore, the power of the models with clustering method and the models with combinative methods are higher than those of the traditional models for random samples. And the powers of the models with combinative methods are the highest for stratified subsets. 為了辨別企業是否有進行盈餘管理之行為，以避免企業經理人為了掩飾經營不善之實或意圖中飽私囊，進而對企業之盈餘進行操弄。因此，過去國內外學者便以應計項目為基礎，建構盈餘管理偵測模型。 針對過去盈餘管理模型研究中，部分迴歸模型解釋力偏低的情形，本研究認為以分年分產業區別資料集的方法下，無法有效減少資料集本身的異質性，而造成迴歸模型解釋力偏低的情況發生。因此，本研究將採用財務比率與企業規模等變數，做為觀察企業特性之變數，並依此進行集群分析以提升資料集之同質性，再利用集群分析後所得之分群變數，將資料集以分年分群法區分資料集。此外，本研究亦結合先前研究的分年分產業法，以分年分產業分群法區分資料集，而為了比較不同資料集區別法對盈餘管理模型的影響，本研究使用Modified Jones Model與績效配對Modified Jones Model，並採用三種資料集區分方法：分年分產業法、分年分群法和分年分產業分群法，分別建構六個盈餘管理模型，並比較各模型之解釋力、精確性（specification）以及檢定力（power）。 實證結果發現，迴歸模型的解釋力以分年分群法所建構之盈餘管理模型，其迴歸模型解釋力能有效提升。模型精確性方面，在隨機樣本與子樣本集中各模型皆具有良好的精確性。檢定力方面，在隨機樣本下以分年分群法與分年分產業分群法所建構之盈餘管理模型，其檢定力皆高於以分年分產業法所建構之盈餘管理模型，而在子樣本集中則以分年分產業分群法所建構之盈餘管理模型，其檢定力為相對最高。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究背景	 1 第二節 研究動機與問題	 2 第三節 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 第一節 盈餘管理之偵測模型	 4 第二節 其他盈餘管理相關研究與問題討論	 12 第三章 研究方法	 14 第一節 估計裁決性應計項目之模型	 14 第二節 迴歸係數估計方法	 16 第三節 盈餘管理模型之精確性	 18 第四節 盈餘管理模型之檢定力	 20 第五節 樣本選取	 22 第六節 研究流程	 23 第四章 實證結果分析	 24 第一節 探索性因素分析與集群分析之結果	 24 第二節 描述性統計	 28 第三節 各模型之精確性	 35 第四節 各模型之檢定力	 37 第五節 調整後R-square之討論	 42 第五章 結論與建議	 44 第一節 研究結論	 45 第二節 研究貢獻	 47 第三節 研究限制與未來研究方向	 48 參考文獻	 50 附錄	 5...|$|R
