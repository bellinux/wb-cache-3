It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E

50|$|The {{insanity}} defense, {{also known}} as the mental disorder defense, is a defense by excuse in a criminal case, arguing that the defendant is not responsible for their actions due to an episodic or persistent psychiatric disease {{at the time of the}} criminal act. This is contrasted with an excuse of provocation, in which defendant is responsible, but the responsibility is lessened due to <b>a</b> temporary <b>mental</b> state. It is also contrasted with a finding that a defendant cannot stand trial in a criminal case because <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disease prevents them from effectively assisting council, from a civil finding in trusts and estates where a will is nullified because it was <b>made</b> when <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disorder prevented <b>a</b> testator from recognizing the natural objects of their bounty, and from involuntary civil commitment to <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> institution, when <b>a</b> person is found to be gravely disabled or to be a danger to themselves or to others.|$|R

40|$|This paper takes a {{theoretical}} approach, drawn upon Goffman’s, and relies upon a model suggested by William Labov, who distinguishes {{three types of}} behavioral rules. People in public places are guided {{by a set of}} behavioral rules which depend on the frequency with which they are violated and the response to violations. Closely associated with these rules is a sort of moral or ritual order, a set of values about appropriate behavior, and the allocation of involvement inherent in the rules. Methodology includes observations <b>made</b> at <b>a</b> state <b>mental</b> hospital by the author.

He shook hands with the Bishop gravely but courteously, nodded to the others with whom he was acquainted, asked the names of the few strangers present, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> careful <b>mental</b> note of what industries and districts they represented. He then accepted a chair by the side of the Bishop, who immediately opened the proceedings.|$|R

60|$|At {{the name}} of Haldin falling from the rapid and {{energetic}} lips of the woman revolutionist, Razumov had the usual brusque consciousness of the irrevocable. But in all the months which had passed over his head he had become hardened to the experience. The consciousness was no longer accompanied by the blank dismay and the blind anger of the early days. He had argued himself into new beliefs; and he had <b>made</b> for himself <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> atmosphere of gloomy and sardonic reverie, a sort of murky medium through which the event appeared like a featureless shadow having vaguely {{the shape of a}} man; a shape extremely familiar, yet utterly inexpressive, except for its air of discreet waiting in the dusk.

40|$|Fatigue is {{a common}} sense caused by {{crushing}} labor, stressful social events and various illnesses. It is usually judged by their subjective symptoms, {{but it should be}} evaluated in an objective perspective. Here we show that the decrease of working efficiency and sympathetic hyperactivity are associated with mental fatigue state caused by prolonged mental workload. Recently we <b>made</b> <b>a</b> new <b>mental</b> fatigue model of healthy volunteers caused by long-term computerized Kraepelin test (CKT) workload. CKT is our new software for automatically checking the calculation capability, with which it is easy to determine the reaction time (RT), coefficient of variance of reaction time (CV), and accuracy of the answers (AC) during tasks. We put 24 healthy volunteers into the fatigue state by subjecting them to 120 minutes’ CKT workload, and then studied the changes in fatigue sensation, RT, CV, and AC before and after the CKT workload. The fatigue sensation, RT, and CV were clearly increased by the fatigue-inducing task and recovered during the resting period. We also studied the changes in autonomic nerve activity by using heart rate variability analysis. The low/high frequency component ratio (LF/HF) was signifi-cantly increased by the fatigue-inducing task and decreased by resting, suggesting that <b>mental</b> stress causes <b>a</b> relatively sympathetic nerve activity-dominant state. Therefore, our new fatigue model involving a long-term CKT workload is <b>a</b> good <b>mental</b> fatigue model to provide much information about the fatigue state simultane-ously, and the increase of RT, CV, and proportion of sympathetic activity (LF/HF) are associated with mental fatigue state. These might be useful objective biomarkers or evaluating <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> fatigue state...|$|R

5000|$|Early Canadian {{court cases}} {{accepted}} expert opinions about PAS, {{used the term}} [...] "syndrome" [...] and concurred with Gardner's theory that only one parent was fully responsible for it. Gardner testified in one case (Fortin v. Major, 1996) but {{the court did not}} accept his opinion, concluding that the child was not alienated based on the evaluation of a court-appointed expert who, unlike Gardner, had met with the family members. More recent cases, while accepting the concept of alienation, have noted the lack of recognition in the DSM-IV, and have generally avoided [...] "syndrome" [...] terminology, emphasizing that changes in custody are stressful for the child and should only occur in the most severe cases. A 2006 research report by the Canadian Department of Justice described PAS as [...] "empirically unsupported" [...] and favored a different framework for dealing with issues of alienation that has more research support. Decisions about possible parental alienation are considered a legal decision, to be determined by the judge based on the facts of the case, rather than <b>a</b> diagnosis <b>made</b> by <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> health professional. There is recognition that rejection of a parent is a complex issue, and that a distinction must be made between pathological alienation and reasonable estrangement.|$|R
