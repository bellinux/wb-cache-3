Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and insist on having sexual intercourse.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E

Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to serenade her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.|$|E
25|$|After college, Turner {{was invited}} to a free agent camp in Utah—a camp where college seniors who are under the radar go and try to {{continue}} their careers. Turner was befriended by a gentleman named Bob Wood, who was a former owner of a BBL team. He told Turner that he would keep him in <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> a team contacted him about players. Later that summer, Turner {{received a call from}} Chester Jets coach Robbie Peers. He told Turner that he would sign him if his first choice, former NBA player Loren Meyer, fell through. Meyer did sign with them, and so the search continued. After a 15-game stint in Puerto Rico with Capitanes de Arecibo, where he averaged 10.7 points and 5.3 rebounds, Turner received a call from Irishman Frankie O'Loane on September 10, 2000. It was Frankie who brought Turner to Ireland to play for Tyrone Towers in Dungannon. Turner arrived in Ireland on September 18, 2000, to begin his first professional season.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} to use Torp as an air station dwindled during the 1950s. Norway {{did not need}} the station for regular stationing of aircraft, and the United States did not need {{it as long as}} Norway did not allow permanent stationing of foreign troops. In October 1956, the military stated that they did not <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> Torp also inaugurated a civilian sector. The municipalities established committee, and on 2 October 1957 the Ministry of Transport and Communications granted permission to establish a municipal civilian sector at Torp. At the time, Jarlsberg was still being used for scheduled services to Vestfold, and the plans to open Torp as a civilian airport met political resistance from Tønsberg. The civilian sector would cost NOK900,000, including a terminal building, a control tower, small maintenance facilities and a tarmac. A limited company, Andelslaget Torp flyplass, was established on 24 October 1958. In addition to the municipalities of Stokke and Sandar, several local companies and private individuals bought shares. The company changed its name to AS Torp Flyplass in 1959.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the negative perceptions of paternal and maternal smoking and their associated factors among adolescents in Hong Kong. METHODS In a school-based cross-sectional survey in 2010 to 2011, 61, 810 Hong Kong secondary school students (mean age 14. 6 years, 50. 8 % boys) reported whether their parents smoked and whether they considered their parents’ smoking unacceptable and <b>minded</b> <b>if</b> their peers knew that their father or mother smoke (indicators of the negative perceptions). Factors associated with negative perceptions of paternal and maternal smoking were explored using multivariable regression models. RESULTS Among students that reported paternal smoking (n= 19. 184, 29. 8 %), 50. 8 % considered it unacceptable, and 21. 0 % <b>minded</b> <b>if</b> their peers knew of it. Of those reporting maternal smoking (n= 3, 678, 5. 7 %), 48. 1 % considered it unacceptable, and 30. 4 % <b>minded</b> <b>if</b> their peers knew of it. Generally, the indicators of negative perceptions of parental smoking were associated with younger age, being certain about the harm of smoking and secondhand smoke, no peer smoking, and no secondhand smoke from the respective parent. Considering parental smoking unacceptable was additionally associated with lower family affluence and not living with any smokers apart from the respective parent. CONCLUSIONS About half of adolescents in Hong Kong with a smoking parent considered their parental smoking unacceptable, and about a quarter <b>minded</b> <b>if</b> their peers knew of their parent’s smoking. Such negative perceptions were more common in adolescents who were certain about the harm of tobacco, and had fewer co-residing smokers and no smoking peers. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
