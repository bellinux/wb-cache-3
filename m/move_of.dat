5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed the <b>move</b> <b>of</b> San Martín's remains to Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Martín, despite the conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the state of Buenos Aires, dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the <b>move</b> <b>of</b> his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.|$|E

The <b>moves</b> <b>of</b> the Turk are {{not made}} at regular {{intervals}} of time, but accommodate themselves to the <b>moves</b> <b>of</b> the antagonist--although this point (of regularity) so important {{in all kinds of}} mechanical contrivance, might have been readily brought about by limiting the time allowed for the <b>moves</b> <b>of</b> the antagonist. For example, if this limit were three minutes, the <b>moves</b> <b>of</b> the Automaton might be made at any given intervals longer than three minutes. The fact then of irregularity, when regularity might have been so easily attained, goes to prove that regularity is unimportant to the action of the Automaton--in other words, that the Automaton is not a pure machine.|$|R

They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus was the {{original}} type species, but the holotype {{was based on a}} single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature changed the type species to the much better known I. bernissartensis, with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original Iguanodon tooth is held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand in Wellington, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the <b>move</b> <b>of</b> Gideon Mantell's son Walter there; after the elder Mantell's death, his fossils went to Walter.|$|E

Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
