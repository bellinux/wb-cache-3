40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of Romanticism was the transformation of human consciousness, both in the aesthetic and moral sense. Romantic aesthetics strove to change the human mind into a more refined <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and expression. But as Romanticism cultivated both romantic agony and reverie, the transformation could {{take the form of}} a soaring rise or a crushing fall, regeneration or degeneration. George MacDonald (1824 – 1905), as a neo-Romantic author, whose thought was shaped by Neoplatonism and Novalis, was certainly concerned with the quest for positive spiritual transformation, but his literary imagination appears to be stirred by the scenes of fall and of loss as evidenced by the deeply disturbing, beautiful, horrifying and haunting images that abound in his work. He was a strange Scottish Victorian. An extremely unorthodox minister of the Congregational Church who would have been burned at stake for his religious views a few centuries before, a student of chemistry who rejected science in favour of a mystic vision, a man who liked luxury but did not need it, who was able to turn down a lucrative offer of a parsonage in New York not to become spoilt by money...|$|R
40|$|Sam Shepard {{has gained}} a {{reputation}} as one of America's foremost living playwrights. In over forty plays, Shepard has broken down traditional notions of dramaturgy in combining both modernist notions of the absurd and familiar icons from the American cultural landscape with an energy tinged by anarchy and violence. Moreover, Shepard has been considered by many critics as a postmodern dramatist. Hassan (1987) piles up a lengthy list of artists from various disciplines whose names epitomize postmodernism for him. The playwrights are: Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Harold Pinter and only Sam Shepard and August Wilson from America. One characteristic of postmodern literature in general, is a focus on the instability of meaning and the inadequacy of language to completely and accurately represent truth, along with an irony and playfulness in the treatment of linguistic constructs. In other words, there is a questioning of language as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and communication. Language can name the pain but it can’t be the pain; language cannot reach the actual individual feeling. Language is not strong enough to convey the intense emotion. In postmodern poetics, there is a paradigmatic shift from the idea that language is transparent to the disclosure of its physicality, its intimacy, its obdurate persistence, and its paradoxical fragility. Thus, language is an insufficient means for transforming th...|$|R

At any rate, Phoebe soon felt that, if not the profound insight of a seer, yet a more than feminine delicacy of appreciation, was making her heart the subject of its regard.

Ihre 'Pieces' lassen so die Unwahrscheinlichkeit hervortreten, dass wahrnehmbare Objekte überhaupt als Kunstwerke rezipiert werden. Zugleich verweisen sie auf das systemtheoretische Desiderat einer Theorie der Kunstrezeption. Dieser Beitrag nutzt die Eigenheiten der Street Art, um das Fungieren von Kunstwerken in der sozialen Situation der Kunstrezeption und die Konstitution dieser Situation genauer zu beschreiben. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die 'Pieces' der Street Art typischerweise zwei Probleme bewältigen müssen, die normalerweise in sozial gut typisierten 'Interaktionsformaten' (Jürgen Markowitz) der Kunstbetrachtung bearbeitet und invisibilisiert werden: Sie müssen die Aufmerksamkeit der Passanten überraschend irritieren, indem sie eine 'logische Sekunde der Anarchie' (Luhmann) auslösen, und anschließend als ein von einem Künstler hervorgebrachtes Kunstwerk überzeugen. Durch die Etablierung von neuartigen Interaktionsformaten der Kunstbetrachtung experimentiert Street Art mit dem Inklusionsmodus des Kunstsystems und verändert die Partizipationsmuster der Kunstrezeption. " (Autorenreferat) "Street Art {{opens up}} the 'design' (Niklas Luhmann) of the public sphere as a new <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> for art and refrains from using the {{secondary}} framings of the 'art world'. Thus, its 'pieces' let emerge the improbability that perceptible objects can actually be recognized as artwork. At the same time, {{they point to the}} theory of social systems' desideratum of a theory of art reception. This article makes use of the features of street art to describe more closely how perceptible objects act as art works in the social situation of art reception and, beyond that, how this situation is constituted. Thereby it becomes apparent that 'pieces' of street art typically have to overcome two problems that are normally solved and made invisible in typified 'formats of social interaction' (Jürgen Markowitz) of the art sphere: They have to irritate the attention of the passers-by unexpectedly, triggering a 'logic second of anarchy' (Luhmann), and, in the following, have to convince as an art work that has been produced by an artist. Street Art experiments with the mode of inclusion of the social system of art and thus can change the pattern of participation in art reception by introducing novel formats of social interaction.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} topics in the study of visual cogni-tion are attention and spatial representation. Space is seen as the underlying <b>medium</b> for much <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> whereas atten-tion acts as a powerful filter through which people experience the world. What is the relationship between these topics? Sev-eral research programs have demonstrated ways in which spa-tial representation influences the allocation of attention. In the first place, it seems that people can often attend to locations (e. g., Posner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980; for a review, see Cave & Bichot, 1999) and to the objects that inhabit them (e. g., Egly, Driver, & Rafal, 1994; for a review, see Scholl, 2001), and such ideas are clear in models of attention that appeal to metaphors such as spotlights or zoom lenses that move about a representational spatial medium (e. g., Eriksen & St. James, 1986; for a review of such metaphors, se...|$|R
40|$|Streaming (grouping pupils {{according}} to a measure or conception of overall ability for most / all teaching) has greatly increased in prevalence among English primary school children {{since the turn of}} the century. Evidence indicates that streaming may disadvantage children in lower groups and increase the overall attainment gap, and this paper explores one possible mechanism through which disparities might manifest: stream-dependent teacher perceptions. Using data for over 800 seven-year-old children who are taking part in the Millennium Cohort Study, analysis investigates whether teachers’ survey-reported judgements and Key Stage One assessments of children correspond to the stream in which a child is placed. Regression modelling controls for potential confounding factors including: cognitive test performance; pupil gender, ethnicity, and month of birth; parents’ income and education levels; parent and teacher <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> children’s behaviour; prior in-school judgments / attainment; special educational need diagnosis; teacher characteristics; and school-type. Both survey-reported judgements of pupils and teacher-assessed Key Stage One assessments are found to be significantly related to children’s stream placement. Children in the top stream are judged to be at a higher level and children in the bottom stream at a lower level than equivalent peers. It seems therefore that streaming may indeed contribute to attainment gaps through the <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> teacher <b>perceptions</b> and assessments, both by advantaging pupils in higher groups and penalising children in lower placements. This suggests a need to recognise, review and potentially revise the growing use of streaming among young children...|$|R

And potentially possible reasons for the influence and the differences between these two cases have been conducted with a qualitative analysis. Some conclusions can be obtained as follows. (1) Local residents' tourism impacts perception, especially tourism benefit perception, directly influences their support of tourism development. (2) Tourism development expectation of local residents directly influences their tourism impacts perception, espetially their tourism benefit perception, and indirectly influences their attitude towards tourism development in the parks via the <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> tourism benefit <b>perception.</b> (3) Residents in both destinations hold positive tourism development expectation with minor differences between the two cases due to cultural differences. Tourism benefit <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> local residents in the two national parks is less and worse than their tourism development expectation, indicating that there is a great gap between their tourism development expectation and tourism impacts perception in these two case study areas.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} diffusion of the Internet technology, TV remains the principal <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> communication. People's <b>perceptions,</b> knowledge, beliefs and opinions about matter of facts get (in) formed through the information reported {{on by the}} mass-media. However, a single source of information (and consensus) could be a potential cause of anomalies in the structure and evolution of a society. Hence, as the information available (and {{the way it is}} reported) is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, the definition of conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated is a pressing challenge. In this paper starting from a report on the last Italian political campaign in 2008, we derive a socio-cognitive computational model of opinion dynamics where agents get informed by different sources of information. Then, a what-if analysis, performed trough simulations on the model's parameters space, is shown. In particular, the scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information...|$|R

This current study aims to define and describe the relationship between individuals' Internet dependency and social support as they function in one specific information environment. How the immigrants' acculturation attitude affects their Internet dependency was also examined. A sample of 158 East-Asian and 160 American college students completed a survey measuring (a) Internet dependency, (b) social support, and (c) acculturation attitude (only for the East-Asians). No correlation was found between social support and Internet dependency across the samples. The dependency typologies the East-Asians developed the most often were social understanding and solitary play. The interaction of acculturation attitude and social support was not found, but acculturation attitude was positively correlated with Internet dependency.
