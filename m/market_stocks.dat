We construct a new measure of risk sharing based on a term structure model, which allows identification of realized stochastic discount factors. Risk sharing is low in Asia, and varies across time and countries, whereas contagion risks are more significant intra-regionally, and relatively stable over the past decade. An overall tradeoff exists between risk sharing and contagion, but the terms of tradeoffs vary across countries, depending on relative economic fluctuations and inflation differentials. Asia, therefore, can potentially enhance risk sharing without raising contagion risk.

This paper analyzes the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> from two angles. First, it compares {{the performance of the}} major stock price index with its underlying fundamentals. Second, it explores the relationship between the Egyptian and other <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> The paper finds that (i) there is some evidence against a stable relationship between the Egyptian index and its fundamental value; and (ii) short-term correlations and long-term cointegrating relations provide conflicting signals on the value of Egyptian stocks as a means of diversification. <b>Stock</b> markets;Stock prices;stock <b>market,</b> cointegration, correlations, <b>stock</b> price, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices, correlation, statistics, stock price index, stock exchanges, overvaluation, autocorrelation, standard deviation, <b>stock</b> index, equity <b>markets,</b> statistic, <b>stock</b> exchange, discount rate, equation, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> capitalization, present value, descriptive statistics, <b>stock</b> valuation, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index, <b>stock</b> indices, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> prices, statistical model, time series, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development, <b>stock</b> price indices, hedge, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> developments, statistical techniques, local <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>stock</b> companies, financial statistics, financial <b>markets,</b> stationary process, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> bubble, covariance, derivative products, financial sector, derivative, stock exchange index, foreign equity, sampling, international financial statistics, real discount rate, discount rates, discounting, asset bubbles, international finance, equity market, empirical model, polynomial, parsimonious model, hypothesis testing, real variables, financial structure...|$|R
40|$|Technical trading {{rules have}} been used in {{financial}} markets in order to examine their ability to yield a superior return. In the early empirical literature, a body of studies showed that trading rules do not outperform a simple buy and hold strategy. However, more recent research finds evidence that supports technical trading rules. This study examines the profitability of trading rules in 14 Middle East and North African (MENA) markets. The trading rules that used are: moving average trading rules (MA), trading range breakout (TRB) trading rules, filter trading rules, channel trading rules, Bollinger band (BB) trading rules and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules. The markets used in this work include the Bahrain <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Jordan <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Kuwait <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Lebanon <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Maltese <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Morocco <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Oman <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Qatar <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Saudi Arabian <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Tunisia <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the Turkey <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> the United Arab Emirates <b>stock</b> <b>markets,</b> the Cyprus <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and the Egypt <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> Our results indicate that according to mean return criterion, the best simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), triangular moving average (TMA), trading range breakout (TRB), filter and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules are for Turkey market. Malta, Bahrain and Oman have the highest percentage of rules that generate positive mean return. In terms of the Sharpe ratio, the best trading rules according to TMA, SMA, filter and channel trading rules are for Turkey market. Furthermore, Turkey has the highest percentage of rules that have a positive Sharpe ratio followed by Cyprus and Egypt. Controlling for data snooping, the results show that the number of trading rules that generate positive return comparing with buy and hold strategy has been reduced but there are still a large number of profitable rules through some markets...|$|R
40|$|A {{perennial}} {{question in}} international finance is {{to what extent}} stock returns are influenced by country-location, as opposed to industry-affiliation, factors. This paper develops a novel methodology to measure these effects, in which portfolios mimicking "pure" country and industry factors are first constructed and their joint dynamics then modeled as regime-switching processes. Estimation using global firm-level data allows us to identify well-defined volatility states over {{the past thirty years}} and shows that the contribution of the industry factor becomes systematically more prominent during high global volatility states, while the country factor contribution declines. Using the model''s estimates, we find that portfolio diversification possibilities vary considerably across economic states.
