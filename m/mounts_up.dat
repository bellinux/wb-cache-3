25|$|In verses {{five and}} six, Mazaraki gives his verdict on the property. He notes {{the absence of}} bird song, which he regards as a very bad sign. In verse six the doctor declares: “If no birds are heard/death reigns here./My advice is that we depart this place quickly/so off I go”. The doctor <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> {{and returns to the}} city in verse seven, {{accompanied}} by Stampfer, Gutmann, and Barnett. Only Salomon “with his prophetic eyes” remains behind to spend the night on that hill, we are told in verse eight.|$|E
25|$|The LTAS {{protection}} system follows an A-kit/B-kit principle, with vehicles designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection. Protection kits {{can be installed}} and uninstalled from vehicles in the field using only basic tools. The A-kit is fitted on the production line and {{is a combination of}} a limited amount of armoring, in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle, together with a significant amount of armor installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis. Two soldiers can install B-kit armor in five hours. An 800-pound RPG protection kit can be installed in two hours at field-level maintenance and completed by the crew within 30 minutes. The JLTV <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> to four M7 Light Vehicle Obscuration Smoke Systems.|$|E

You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [...] Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are {{set in motion by}} the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible." ...|$|E

50|$|BIX mounts are {{wall-mounted}} frames, generally {{built from}} 16 gauge steel. The frames feature a rectangular plastic backplate, and two plastic brackets that extend {{from either side}} of the backplate to fit between two and ten BIX connectors. The connectors are oriented horizontally on the mount. The BIX mounts are referred to as either '12E','10A' or '10C'. The 12E frames will <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> to 12 connectors; The 10A frames will <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> to 10 connectors; the 10C frames will mount 2 connectors.|$|R

60|$|Every time he uttered this ejaculation, {{his eyes}} {{seemed to be in}} danger of {{starting}} out; and every sentence he spoke, he delivered in a sort of tune, always exactly the same, and more like a gust of wind, which begins low, <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> high, and falls again, than any other comparison I can find for it.|$|E
60|$|The soldier {{had chosen}} {{and was ready}} to go.

60|$|The cave {{is full of}} treasures; but Beowulf heeds them not, {{for near}} him lies Grendel, dead from the wound {{received}} the previous night. Again Beowulf swings the great sword and strikes off his enemy's head; and lo, as the venomous blood touches the sword blade, the steel melts like ice before the fire, and only the hilt is left in Beowulf's hand. Taking the hilt and the head, the hero enters the ocean and <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> to the shore.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving all the treasures, Beowulf {{takes only}} the golden hilt of [...] the magic sword {{and the head}} of Grendel, reënters the sea and [...] <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> to his companions.

60|$|This {{species was}} {{probably}} solitary, except when assembling {{for the purpose}} of display; but in a majority of cases, especially in the Passerine order, the solitary species performs its antics alone, or with no witness but its mate. Azara, describing a small finch, which he aptly named Oscilador, says that early and late in the day it <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> vertically to a moderate height; then, flies off to a, distance of twenty yards, describing a perfect curve in its passage; turning, it flies back over the imaginary line it has traced, and so on repeatedly, appearing like a pendulum swung in space by an invisible thread.|$|E

Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'Tis iron--that I know--not gold. 'Tis split, too--that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; {{the sort that}} needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight! ...|$|E

60|$|The egg's no chick {{by falling}} from the hen; Nor man a Christian, till he's born again. The egg's at first {{contained}} in the shell; Men, afore grace, in sins and darkness dwell. The egg, when laid, by warmth is made a chicken, And Christ, by grace, those dead in sin doth quicken. The egg, when first a chick, the shell's its prison; So's flesh to the soul, who yet with Christ is risen. The shell doth crack, the chick doth chirp and peep, The flesh decays, as men do pray and weep. The shell doth break, the chick's at liberty, The flesh falls off, the soul <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> on high But both do not enjoy the self-same plight; The soul is safe, the chick now fears the kite.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the period}} of King Alfred's reign seems a very remote one as we look back toward it from the present day, it was still eight hundred years after the Christian era that he ascended his throne. Tolerable {{authentic}} history of the British realm <b>mounts</b> <b>up</b> through these eight hundred years {{to the time of}} Julius Cæsar. Beyond this the ground is covered by a series of romantic and fabulous tales, pretending to be history, which extend back eight hundred years further to the days of Solomon; so that a much longer portion of the story of that extraordinary island comes before than since the days of Alfred. In respect, however to all that pertains to the interest and importance of the narrative, the exploits and the arrangements of Alfred are the beginning.|$|E
