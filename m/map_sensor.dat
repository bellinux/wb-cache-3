40|$|The {{development}} of Mobile Mapping System (MMS) {{is still at}} initial stage in Malaysia. The research in MMS {{has been carried out}} quite awhile since the first prototype introduced by the Center of Mapping at The Ohio State University (Bossler et. al., 1991). This system integrates some navigation sensor such as Global Positioning System (GPS), inertial navigation system (INS) and <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> such as Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera. The strength of the MMS lays in their ability to directly georeferenced their <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> by GPS. A <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> is georeferenced when it is positioned and orientated relative to a known mapping coordinate frame. Once georeferenced, the <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> can be used to determine the position of object points bases on the digital image in the same mapping coordinate frame. This research concentrates on georeferencing the geographic and topographic features and updating a GIS (Geographic Information System) base map using consumer digital camera and GPS positioning technique. The GPS provides the position of the camera and the images from the camera are used to determine the geodetic position of the object points using PhotoModeler software and developed program...|$|R
40|$|Mobile mapping {{has been}} the subject of {{significant}} research and development by several research teams over the past decade. A mobile mapping system consists mainly of a moving platform, navigation <b>sensors,</b> and <b>mapping</b> <b>sensors.</b> The mobile platform may be a land vehicle, a vessel, or an aircraft. Generally, the navigation sensors, such as GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers, vehicle wheel sensors, and INS (Inertial Navigation System), provide both the track of the vehicle and positional and orientational information of the <b>mapping</b> <b>sensors.</b> Objects to be surveyed are sensed directly by <b>mapping</b> <b>sensors,</b> for instance CCD (Charge Coupled Device) cameras, laser rangers, and radar sensors. Since the orientation parameters of the <b>mapping</b> <b>sensors</b> are estimated directly by the navigation sensors, complicated computations such as photogrammetric triangulation are greatly simplified or avoided. Spatial information of the objects is extracted directly from the georeferenced <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> data by integrating navigation <b>sensor</b> data. Mobile <b>mapping</b> technology has evolved to a stage which allows mapping and GIS industries to apply it in order to obtain high flexibility in data acquisition, more information with less time and effort, and high productivity. In addition, a successful extension of this technology to helicopter- borne and airborne systems will provide a powerful tool for large scale and medium scale spatial data acquisition and database updating. This paper provides a systematic introduction to the use of mobile mapping technology for spatial data acquisition. Issues related to the basic principle, data processing, automation, achievable accuracies and a break down of errors are given. Application considerations and application examples of the technology in highway and utility mapping are described. Finally, the perspective of the mobile mapping technology is discussed...|$|R

50|$|When tuning a MAF-equipped {{vehicle to}} operate in MAFless mode, the MAF is removed. This {{requires}} the use of an alternative method of calculating airflow into the engine, which is also referred to as 'Speed-Density' system, as opposed to a MAF system. On vehicles so equipped, this alternative involves the use of a manifold absolute pressure, or <b>MAP,</b> <b>sensor.</b> The <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> measures pressure in the engine's inlet manifold. When coupled with data regarding the engine's revolutions per minute, or RPM, and a table of volumetric efficiency over the operating range of the engine, the <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> can be used by the engine management computer to calculate fuel requirements.|$|E
50|$|<b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> {{data can}} be {{converted}} to air mass data using the speed-density method. Engine speed (RPM) and air temperature are also necessary to complete the speed-density calculation. The <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> can also be used in OBD II (on-board diagnostics) applications to test the EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) valve for functionality, an application typical in OBD II equipped General Motors engines.|$|E

50|$|Another small {{disadvantage}} is as {{the engine}} wears, the mean vacuum is decreased. This 'fools' the <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> into overfuelling. This {{is only a}} problem on very high mileage engines.|$|E
50|$|In short, most boost sensors {{will read}} 100 kPa {{less than a}} <b>MaP</b> <b>sensor</b> reads. One can convert boost to MaP by adding 100 kPa. One can convert from MaP to boost by {{subtracting}} 100 kPa.|$|E
50|$|Inspection (and replacement, if necessary) of the <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor,</b> and its {{accompanying}} vacuum hose, {{is often}} a solution to many driveability problems. This sensor largely controls the engine's driveability. Stuck EGR valves are also very common on the Tech IV.|$|E

50|$|The {{processor}} in the ECU is an Intel AN87C196KD {{running at}} 12 MHz and featuring 8KB of on-chip ROM for storage of code and data and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM. The main connector is a 36-pin TE Connectivity 344108 ("Econoseal"), and its mating connector (used in the wiring harness) is a TE Connectivity 344111. On {{earlier versions of}} the system, a <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> was internal to the ECU, requiring that an inlet manifold vacuum line be run to the ECU enclosure. In MEMS 1.6, this <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> is the Motorola 5141550T02, and the vacuum line feeding it passes through a vapor trap to prevent admission of fuel vapor into the ECU.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a <b>MAP</b> <b>sensor</b> on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E

50|$|With OBD II standards, vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{were required to}} test the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve for functionality during driving. Some manufacturers use the <b>MaP</b> <b>sensor</b> to accomplish this. In these vehicles, they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor. The <b>MaP</b> <b>sensor</b> is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve. The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (i.e., a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air) the powertrain control module (PCM) will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MaP sensor's values. If the EGR is functioning properly, the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditionally, {{the term}} mobile mapping {{refers to a}} means of {{collecting}} geospatial data using <b>mapping</b> <b>sensors</b> that are mounted on a mobile platform. Historically, this process was mainly driven by the need for highway infrastructure mapping and transportation corridor inventories. However, the recent advances in <b>mapping</b> <b>sensor</b> and telecommunication technologies create the opportunity that, completely new, emergent application areas of mobile mapping to evolve rapidly. This article examines the potential of mobile mapping technology (MMT) in sports science and in particular in competitive rowing. Notably, in this study the concept definition of mobile mapping somehow differs from the traditional one in a way that, {{the end result is}} not relevant to the geospatial information acquired as the moving platform travels in space. In contrast, the interest is placed on the moving platform (rowing boat) itself and on the various subsystems which are also in continuous motion. As an initial step of an on-going research this article discusses the biomechanics of rowing in relation to applied technique and equipment. Also, it reviews the current practices and sensor systems used for monitoring and evaluating performance in rowing. Finally, it presents an integrated data acquisition and processing scheme for rowing based on modern MMT. To this effect, a critica...|$|R
