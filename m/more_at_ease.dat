5|$|Mandela's 90th {{birthday}} was marked {{across the country}} on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London. In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich {{to help the poor}} across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally {{in the midst of a}} storm in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted {{exclusively}} {{to the music of}} Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E
5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson to feel <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson {{responded to the}} situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E

25|$|Support {{for a more}} {{integrated}} course includes that by allowing patient interaction early, the course produces students who are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with communicating with patients and better developed interpersonal skills. Criticisms include, questioning whether students {{in the first year}} have a place in the healthcare environment, when actual clinical knowledge may be virtually nil.|$|E
25|$|My {{painting}} {{does not}} come from the easel. I prefer to tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance of a hard surface. On the floor I am <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.|$|E

25|$|Because dogs often bark {{excessively}} due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing {{aspects of}} an animal's environment {{to make them}} more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and make them feel <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.|$|E
25|$|The next day, in {{a section}} that is known as The Naked Truth, the couple is {{together}} required to reveal themselves behind a silhouette screen, where they see each other nude, but with Woodall, Constantine and the audience at home only seeing a silhouette. The participants have to comment on and point out on a small camera {{what they think is}} best about their partner's body and figure and are prompted to confront their insecurities. Confronting issues and using Woodall and Constantine as confidantes, is aimed to help the couple release insecurities and burdens, and ultimately become <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with each other.|$|E
25|$|With fewer bouncers, flatter wickets and a {{requirement}} to score quickly, he was <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> in limited-overs cricket than perhaps any other batsman {{in the history}} other than Viv Richards with a record that was ahead of its era: His career was over by 1985 by which time, he had racked up over 2500 runs in just 60-odd games with 7 hundreds and a strike rate of 84 (over 5 runs an over) {{in an era when}} 4 runs an over was considered exceptional batting. He was at his peak during the 1982â€“83 season (already mentioned above) when he hit four one-day international hundreds, regularly reaching the three-figure mark off 70 to 80 balls effortlessly. His versatility lay in adapting his game according to the situation as Australians once found out when he calmly and quietly compiled a swift 84 off 100 odd balls without a boundary.|$|E

25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> when restrained.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} a city of extreme social {{inequality}} between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing Â£400 of lace and Â£10,000 in diamonds. The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He {{was also a}}ctive in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public health measures and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area.|$|E
500|$|The Ambler's Texaco Station {{is built}} in a common gas station style known as [...] "house and canopy" [...] style or [...] "domestic style." [...] The style was {{developed}} by Standard Oil of Ohio in 1916, and consisted of a small house-like building with an attached canopy. The canopy extended out over the pumps to protect customers from the weather. The style was meant to evoke feelings of home and comfort in travelers and, in turn, to make people <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> buying goods from the station.|$|E

500|$|The {{trade paper}} Variety commended the film's [...] "combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction" [...] and the [...] "variety of moods, action, suspense, comedy and drama that makes Casablanca an A-1 entry at the b.o." [...] "Film is splendid anti-Axis propaganda, {{particularly}} inasmuch as the propaganda is strictly {{a by-product of}} the principal action and contributes to it instead of getting in the way." [...] The review also applauded the performances of Bergman and Henreid and note that [...] "Bogart, as might be expected, is <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He felt a little wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{later said}} he got [...] "my rear end handed to me" [...] in his loss to Rush and {{acknowledged}} his own hubris. However, many analysts believe that Obama's loss helped him to learn from his mistakes, which enabled him to run more successful campaigns in 2004 and 2008. [...] Obama {{was seen as a}} stiff policy wonk, and he used the experience to hone his ability to connect with voters. [...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took a hard look at himself after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> on the campaign trail." [...] He put more effort into his campaign, hiring David Axelrod as his chief political strategist. Also, Obama increased his focus on the Illinois Senate, improving his legislative accomplishments.|$|E
60|$|Laverick {{stood with}} his back to the little {{fireplace}} and with his hands behind him--a commanding figure in the tiny room full of feminine trifles. He looked a great deal <b>more</b> <b>at</b> his <b>ease</b> than he really was.|$|R

500|$|Washing Machine is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1994 DGC album Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star. After Experimental Jet Set, the band {{decided to take}} a hiatus from performing live and concentrated on numerous side projects. Band member Kim Gordon played with Julia Cafritz of Pussy Galore in Free Kitten, drummer Steve Shelley performed with Jad Fair in Mosquito, guitarist Lee Ranaldo played with free jazz drummer William Hooker and singer/guitarist Thurston Moore released his first solo album, Psychic Hearts. Moore and Gordon also had their first child, Coco. According to Moore, their daughter had provided a different perspective for the band: [...] "I'm more focused and level-headed. There's a sublime awareness factor of your spiritual place in the world. I feel <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with myself... Babies are little Buddhas. They're completely great".|$|E
500|$|... "Heavy Crown" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kevipod from Direct Lyrics described the song as [...] "the most-anticipated track" [...] from Reclassified, writing [...] "love {{the contrast between}} the menacing, raucous Iggy Azalea verses to the vulnerable Ellie choruses". When the track premiered ahead of the release of Reclassified, one writer from Capital wrote that [...] "it doesn't disappoint!". Carl Smith from SugarScape described the track as [...] "SASS CENTRAL", ending his review with [...] "it's generally just our new office jam". The track was also well received by Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, who commended the tracks instrumental and Goulding's [...] "cocky" [...] cameo. In a positive review, Nolan Feeney from TIME commented that [...] "'Heavy Crown' wonâ€™t change the minds of anyone whoâ€™s already written off the rapper, but Iggy's double-time rap over the militaristic march seems <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> than the occasionally clunky verses on early singles." [...] He went on to describe Azalea's first verse in the song as [...] "unforgettable", and described Goulding's vocals as [...] "smooth". A writer for Fuse commented that [...] "Iggy and Ellie know they're on top and aren't planning on moving from their spot anytime soon." ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] she replied, gazing {{around her}} now and {{gradually}} becoming <b>more</b> <b>at</b> her <b>ease,</b> [...] "I know but little.
