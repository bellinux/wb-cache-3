5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day.

25|$|Initially, gamma {{radiation}} from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than Co-60: 15,000 times <b>more</b> intense <b>at</b> 1 hour; 35 times <b>more</b> intense <b>at</b> 1 week; 5 times <b>more</b> intense <b>at</b> 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times <b>more</b> intense <b>at</b> 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the 60Co again after about 75 years.|$|R

The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women. The AWSA worked for suffrage mostly at the state level while the NWSA worked <b>more</b> <b>at</b> the national level.

Whales historically seen in Yellow Sea could have been distinct from outer Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or <b>more</b> <b>at</b> near maximum, and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter.|$|E
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined <b>more</b> <b>at</b> the level of the family than that of the nation-state.

At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once <b>more</b> <b>at</b> Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.|$|E
30|$|A {{variable}} {{effect of}} tide on birds, {{depending on the}} season, was qualitatively consistent with past studies in this region. Hubbard and Dugan (2003) found that shorebirds were <b>more</b> common <b>at</b> low tides in the spring. This was expected because low tide exposes more beach habitat and increases foraging opportunities. However, Hubbard and Dugan (2003) {{were not able to}} explain why shorebirds were <b>more</b> common <b>at</b> high tide in the winter and fall (this could be related to confounds between time of day and tidal height and season). In our survey, shorebirds were also <b>more</b> common <b>at</b> high tide from September to December but otherwise not affected by tide or <b>more</b> common <b>at</b> low tide. We also do not know why birds would be <b>more</b> abundant <b>at</b> high tide. One possibility is that high tides in the fall cause beach hoppers to seek higher elevations, which exposes them to predation by shorebirds.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} White sought to leave Harveys was {{that the size of}} the kitchen was {{insufficient}} to allow him to expand the range of techniques in the dishes he served. With the move to The Restaurant, he added dishes with techniques such as confit, braising and en vessie highlighted. The move also saw an expansion to the number of different options served; while Harveys may have had a handful of main courses, this was increased to around 15 or <b>more</b> <b>at</b> The Restaurant. White's concept for the food was simplified versions of classical French cuisine.|$|E
