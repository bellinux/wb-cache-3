Because of atmospheric attenuation of the acoustic signals at the RASS frequencies used by boundary layer radar wind profilers, the altitude range that can be sampled is usually 0.1 to 1.5 km, depending on atmospheric conditions (e.g., high wind velocities tend to limit RASS altitude coverage to a few hundred meters because the acoustic signals are blown out of the radar beam).|$|E
40|$|If a {{convenient}} and reliable method {{can be found}} and confirmed for in-situ measurement of the operational condition of a gas turbine meter, then the cost of maintaining turbine meters might be substantially reduced by eliminating many unnecessary removals from service for calibration checks and repairs. This report describes a brief theoretical and experimental program to assess the feasibility of using gas turbine meter pressure drop measurements to diagnose measurement errors caused by mechanical wear, damage, and/or dirt buildup and erosion. If pressure drop at the throat of a turbine meter can be correlated to <b>meter</b> <b>pulse</b> rate over the operating range of the meter, then relatively simple field pressure measurements {{might be used to}} detect meter calibration changes, substantially reducing turbine meter operating and maintenance costs. Results show that for the two single-rotor turbine meters tested, excellent correlation between differential pressure and pulse rate was achieved over a sizable flow range. This finding suggests that the pressure drop from the upstream piping to the throat of the turbine meter can infer flow well enough to attest turbine meter accuracy to a fraction of one percent. ...|$|E

We {{have examined the}} fluence-response, time-course, and reciprocity characteristics of four nuclear, blue-light-regulated transcripts in Pisum sativum L. var Alaska: Cab RNA, pEA 207 RNA, pEA 215 RNA, and pEA 25 RNA. To avoid complications due to blue-light-induced transformation of phytochrome, we have adapted the procedure of measuring blue-light-induced changes in steady-state-RNA levels in seedlings grown in continuous red light. The fluence-response curves for Cab and pEA 215 RNA are bell-shaped, with peak accumulations at 102 and 101 micromoles per square meter, respectively. No response is observed at 104 micromoles per square meter. pEA 25 RNA has threshold and saturation fluences below 10 − 1 micromoles per square meter. pEA 207 RNA has a threshold at 102 micromoles per square meter and saturates above 104 micromoles per square meter. pEA 215 and Cab RNA start to increase within 1 hour after the 101 micromoles per square <b>meter</b> <b>pulse,</b> and finish accumulation by 5 hours. The decrease in pEA 207 RNA in response to 104 micromoles per square meter and pEA 25 RNA in response to 101 or 104 micromoles per square meter starts between 3 and 5 hours after the blue-light pulse.

40|$|We {{estimated}} deposition and resuspension {{rates of}} natural {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) in Bloomington Creek, Idaho, a mountain stream flowing at 225 L s 21. POM was collected from the water column, fractionated into two size classes — very fine POM (VFPOM, 15 – 52 mm) and fine POM (FPOM, 53 – 106 mm), and radiolabeled by using 14 C-dimethylsulfate. The labeled particles in each size class and a conservative tracer were released to the stream in <b>metered</b> <b>pulses</b> and then sampled from the water column at six stations extending 1 km downstream for 4 d. Deposition and resuspension rates were estimated by fitting a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model to 14 C-concentrations measured during and after release. Model-estimated deposition velocities were 0. 12 (0. 09 – 0. 16, 95 % confidence interval) and 0. 18 (0. 10 – 0. 31) mm s 21 for VFPOM and FPOM, respectively. There was some (; 0. 05 mm s 21) additional short-term (; 20 min) detention of VFPOM and FPOM {{that may have been}} related to transient storage.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a cognitive}} and comparative perspective on human rhythmic cognition that emphasizes a key distinction between <b>pulse</b> perception and <b>meter</b> perception. <b>Pulse</b> perception involves {{the extraction of}} a regular pulse or &# 39;tactus&# 39; from a stream of events. Meter perception involves grouping of events into hierarchical trees with differing levels of &# 39;strength&# 39;, or perceptual prominence. I argue that metrically-structured rhythms are required to either perform or move appropriately to music (e. g. to dance). Rhythms, from this metrical perspective, constitute &# 39;trees in time&# 39;. Rhythmic syntax represents a neglected form of musical syntax, and warrants more thorough neuroscientific investigation. The recent literature on animal entrainment clearly demonstrates the capacity to extract the pulse from rhythmic music, and to entrain periodic movements to this pulse, in several parrot species and a California sea lion, and a more limited ability {{to do so in}} one chimpanzee. However, the ability of these or other species to infer hierarchical rhythmic trees remains, for the most part, unexplored (with some apparent negative results from macaques).
