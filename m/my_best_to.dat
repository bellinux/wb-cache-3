Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network's coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 – June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 – June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

In my dealings with the young RCNVR captains I did <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> give them the opportunity to find their own feet and they did it. Once having tasted success they never looked back.

500|$|Stevens knew {{no one in}} Gettysburg, and {{initially}} had little success as a lawyer. [...] His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was {{a case in which}} a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the constables who had arrested him. [...] His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people, and he never lacked for business thereafter. In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt, [...] "Sir, I am doing <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> conceal it." ...|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein was {{questioned}} {{after his arrival}} at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell. After speaking to Israeli attorney Michael Sfard he was placed on a flight back to Amsterdam, his point of origin. In an interview with Haaretz, Finkelstein stated [...] "I did <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me. I am confident that I have nothing to hide... no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations." [...] He had been travelling to visit friends in the West Bank and stated he {{had no interest in}} visiting Israel. Sfard said banning Finkelstein from entering the country [...] "recalls the behavior of the Soviet bloc countries".|$|E

500|$|Malouma Mediah was {{involved}} in a project in 2009, to relocate 9,000 slum-dwelling families from {{the outskirts of the city}} into inner city neighborhoods. She insisted that for health reasons, improvements would first have to be made to the infrastructure. In August 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature appointed Malouma as Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. The position required her to raise awareness of environmental problems with a view to introducing sustainable solutions. On her appointment she commented: [...] "I am delighted at the confidence that IUCN just placed in me. I am deeply honored. I will do <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> fulfill this great responsibility." [...] In September 2012, she performed in a concert given during the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress held on Jeju Island, South Korea.|$|E
500|$|Sanford {{announced}} in late December 1997 {{that he had}} been diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} noted that Lewis' [...] "delicately seductive vocals are more versatile", with the Detroit Free Press stating that her voice [...] "smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie-rock, Lewis is as adept on the ballads as {{she is on the}} rave-ups." [...] The Times {{considered}} Lewis' songwriting [...] "leagues ahead of anything that she has done in the past" [...] and her vocals sound [...] "as though she means it". DeRogatis pointed out that [...] "Lewis' impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel as if her music was crafted just for them." [...] However, Angela Zimmerman of Crawdaddy! felt that Lewis often used a [...] "pervasive soprano that she can't quite execute" [...] on tracks like [...] "Black Sand", [...] "Pretty Bird", [...] "Trying <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> <b>to</b> Love You", and [...] "Jack Killed Mom".|$|E

500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I did <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E
500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to think I am not trying <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E

[...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to do <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E
500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{development}} of [...] "This Love", the band {{stated that the}} song was influenced by musician Stevie Wonder. The piece {{was written in the}} key of C minor, the metre is set in common time, and the piece's tempo is a moderate 95 beats per minute. The introduction of [...] "This Love" [...] features a piano-led strut. Maroon 5 has called [...] "This Love" [...] a prime pop-rock song. The music featured in the song has a lot more rock-guitar crunch, and is considered a soulful and pop/rock song. According to Johnny Loftus of Allmusic, the music featured in the song has [...] "a slick channeling of vintage R rhythms into punchy pop dynamics". Loftus felt that the song features [...] "Levine's wry falsetto around strutting, bottom-heavy piano and percussion both programmed and live; chirping backup vocals and washes of sunny synth and flute acted as counterweights". Loftus also noted that the band has a [...] "sexual charge" [...] with the lyrics, [...] "I tried <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> feed her appetite / To keep her coming every night / So hard to keep her satisfied". The Boston Globe's Steve Morse described the single's sounds as [...] "a rocking yet soulful tale about the breakup of a relationship". Meghan Bard of The Daily Campus adds that the song has [...] "Stevie Wonder-esque vocals and a funky R beat". In the extended version of the song, which is 4 minutes and 26 seconds long, the chorus of the band's next single, [...] "She Will Be Loved", can be heard from 3:21 to 3:42, during the outro.|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
