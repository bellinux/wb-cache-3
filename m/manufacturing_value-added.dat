40|$|Abstract. Cotton stalk is a {{by-product}} of cotton planting process, and a great resource as a raw biomass material for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>value-added</b> composite products. The fine structure and fiber size of the cortex, xylem of the cotton stalk were studied in this paper. In addition, a new method for the processing of cotton stalk filament was developed. Composites consisting of polypropylene (PP) and cotton stalk filament were prepared by hot pressing. The effects of PP content and compressing temperature on the mechanical properties of cotton stalk filament /PP composites were studied. The results show that elevated temperatures, all of the composites are substantially stiffer and stronger than that at lower temperature. PP content improves the intensity and adhesion of composites. Simultaneous optimization of composites properties indicates that the composites with PP content of 40 % and the compressing temperature of 195 ℃ would sufficient {{meet the requirements of}} the GB/T 4897. 1 - 2003 standard.

40|$|I use firm-level {{census data}} to study {{changes in the}} {{structure}} of Ethiopia's manufacturing sector between 1998 and 2008. Over this period, aggregate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>value-added</b> grew {{at the same rate as}} GDP, the number of manufacturing firms more than doubled, and average firm size fell by more than 40 %. I highlight substantial heterogeneity in economic performance across firms, and emphasise a strong association between firm size and value-added per worker. I find that 29 % of the value-added size gap can be attributed to differences in product selection across small and large firms. I find no systematic difference in the output price charged by small and large firms for a given product. I therefore attribute the remaining value-added size gap to a higher level of physical labour productivity in large than in small firms. I conclude that small and large firms in Ethiopia use quite different technologies to produce similar products, and that an increase in the number of large firms would raise value-added per worker and ultimately GDP per capita in the country.
