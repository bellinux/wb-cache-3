50|$|Potassium sorbate is {{effective}} {{for the control}} of fungal growth, including yeast, especially for sweet wines in bottle. However, one potential hazard is the metabolism of sorbate to geraniol which is a potent and unpleasant by-product. The production of geraniol occurs only if sorbic acid is present during <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> To avoid this, either the wine must be sterile bottled or contain enough sulfur dioxide to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Sterile bottling includes the use of filtration.|$|E
50|$|The clear fluid is then {{transferred}} to another cooling tank where it is retained for about 24 to 26 hours with temperature maintained at about 20 C. Then the fluid is transferred to stainless steel tanks for {{the first stage of}} fermentation and then to oak wood barrels for the <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> process. This process takes a minimum of 6 months for red wine. Fermentation is facilitated by adding yeast (usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus in suitable proportion to the fluid being fermented. The fermentation process is done in controlled temperature of 13 - 15 C for a period of 15-20 days for white wine and at 25 - 28 C for 8-10 days for red wine. By this process sugar gets converted to alcohol and the wine is ready for distillation and filtration depending on the status of fomented wine;filtration is done with use of 0.45 micron filter and the wine is filled in bottles. The bottled wine is kept for aging for a minimum of 3 months in the case of red wine and 1-2 months in the case of white wine. It is only after this ageing that the wines are marketed.|$|E
5000|$|Winemaking with Leon Millot:Some winemakers {{believe that}} if left on the skins too long, Leon Millot can develop {{unwanted}} herbaceous notes from its Vitis riparia background. Also, the grape is high in malic acid and a malolactic fermentation is usually necessary (this should be begun no earlier than Specific Gravity = 1040, and may be delayed to {{a month or so}} after primary fermentation; some winemakers believe that delaying the MLF allows more time for the added tannins to fix the color). A malic-reducing yeast might also be used to good effect. As the grape is low in tannin, a tannin addition during fermentation is often useful, and that may also help to prevent color loss. If Leon Millot is allowed to remain too long at higher pH levels, its deep, vivid purple color can change to red or brick red. Some winemakers believe that Leon Millot should be harvested at no higher than pH 3.2 for this reason. Also, take care to reduce the pH quickly after <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> if the pH rises too high (a rise to approximately pH 4.0 is not unusual, and can lead to color loss). Better examples of Leon Millot wine have won significant awards, and many wine lovers believe they can rival the better vinifera wines. But, as with all modern varieties of grapes ("hybrid" [...] grapes), it takes work in the winery to realize the grape's full potential.|$|E
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal {{secondary}} metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. It has been detected {{in a wide}} range of commodities, including cereals, coffee, grapes, raisins, must and wine. Within grape derivative products, the raisins, red wine and sweet wines have reported to contain the highest OTA levels. Aspergillus section Nigri (A. niger and A. carbonarius) are considered the OTA source in these commodities and they are commonly isolated among other fungi from grapes and raisins. Starting from this basis the objectives of this thesis were focused into three main aspects: (1) Evaluation of the food products: vine dried fruits and special wines, concerning the mycobiota and OTA occurrence and incidence; (2) Ecophysiological studies of the ochratoxigenic fungi and accompanying mycobiota as affected by environmental conditions; (3) Control and preventive methods such as the evaluation of residual activity of pre-harvest fungicides during grape dehydration and the use of modified atmospheres. Wine origin and winemaking procedure showed to be determinant for the final OTA content. All special wines analysed from northern European regions were negative for OTA while more than 50 % of wines from warmer regions were positive for OTA contamination. The wines with higher OTA levels were fortified musts followed by those made from dried grapes. Acoholic and <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentations,</b> biological 'crianza' (Flor yeast) and the action of Botrytis cinerea in noble rot of grapes may diminish the OTA levels in wine. In grapes, the presence of Aspergillus section Nigri became predominant at harvest and mainly during sun-drying. Prevalence of Aspergillus section Nigri can be explained by their adaptation to environmental conditions of sun-drying, and by their ability to dominate other fungal species involved when coming into contact with them. Among the Aspergillus section Nigri, A. niger aggregate was dominant, although A. carbonarius increased its inc...|$|R

40|$|Available {{data show}} that {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) is a possible contaminant of wine and its concentration is higher in red wines than in white and rosé. The aim of this work was to study the fate of OTA during the main stages of the winemaking process (crushing, maceration, alcoholic fermentation, <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> bottle-aging) {{and the influence of}} technological treatments on OTA concentration in order to identify the critical process steps. Attention was focused on red winemaking, in different wineries in the south of Italy, with two naturally OTA contaminated grape varieties (‘Negroamaro’ and ‘Primitivo’) and on different vintages (2001 – 2002 – 2003). The results show that no OTA is produced during winemaking, but each operation during winemaking can modify OTA content. The OTA present in grapes to a certain degree is released to the juice during crushing.

40|$|Pinot noir grapes offer a {{challenge}} for wine makers due to the variety’s unusual tannin distribution and non-acylated (colourless) anthocyanins. Initially, two scoping studies using replicated ‘French Press’ microvinification of Pinot noir must were undertaken and wines were evaluated for seven phenolic measures quantified by modified Somers analysis using UV-visible spectrophotometry and chemometrics (total phenolics, total pigment, anthocyanin, tannin, non-bleachable pigment, colour density, hue). The scoping studies established that yeast strain choice and maceration approach could significantly influence the concentration of phenolics in Pinot noir wine. A novel maceration process, microwave maceration, which {{was included in the}} scoping study was associated with significantly higher concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanin, tannin and non-bleachable pigment in wines at 18 months bottle age, compared with control wines that had been fermented on skins for a comparable period (usually seven or eight days). Microwave maceration involved heating Pinot noir must to 70 ºC using a domestic 1. 5 kW microwave oven. Must was held at that temperature for a ‘hold time’ period to allow for time/temperature mediated phenolic extraction, before being cooled to 27 ºC for inoculation and fermentation under controlled conditions. The rapid and effective phenolic extraction from microwave maceration of Pinot noir grape must allowed several novel approaches to winemaking. For example, microwave macerated must with one hour of hold time was pressed off skins and fermented as an ‘enriched juice’. Early press-off microwave maceration wines were equivalent to control wine that had been fermented on skins for most phenolic parameters, but were significantly higher in fourteen out of sixteen aroma compounds examined by GCMS. For example, the microwave treatment wines were generally four to six-fold higher for the acetates examined, and two-fold higher for most of the ethyl esters examined. Microwave maceration was effective for sanitation of Pinot noir grape must and reduced background yeast to≤ 100 cfu/mL by plating to Wallerstein Laboratories Nutrient agar, which was more effective than standard must sanitation by application of 50 mg/L sulphur dioxide in the form of potassium metabisulfite solution (2 x 104 cfu/mL). Due to the sanitation effect of microwave maceration, must did not require application of sulphur dioxide at crushing to suppress background yeast and bacteria. Sulfur dioxide and high fermentation temperatures are stressors which have been shown to inhibit <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> in red wine fermentation. The rapid extraction of phenolics by microwave maceration prior to alcoholic fermentation, offset the need for high fermentation temperature (eg. 30 ºC) and this, coupled with the absence of sulphur dioxide, allowed co-inoculation of yeast and malo-lactic bacterial cultures for simultaneous alcoholic and <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Early press-off microwave macerated Pinot noir must inoculated in this way finished alcoholic and <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> within 17 days demonstrating the possibility of highly efficient red wine making from this novel process.

40|$|Enzymatic mirocalorimetry {{has been}} {{successfully}} employed in the reliable determination of the L-malic acid concentration in some foods and cosmetic products.

40|$|Carbonic anhydrase {{studies were}} used to {{determine}} the primary form of carbonic acid produced from decarboxylation of l-malic acid by “malic” enzyme in malolactic strains of five different species of lactic acid bacteria. Addition of carbonic anhydrase to the reaction mixture containing crude bacterial extract and l-malic acid, at pH 7, in all five cases resulted in an increase (13 to 23 %) in the rate of carbon dioxide evolution over the control. The results indicated that the primary form of carbonic acid released from “malic” enzyme was not anhydrous carbon dioxide as previously supposed and as has been shown for other decarboxylating enzymes. The standard free-energy changes of the malo-lactic reaction with the various forms of carbonic acid as the primary decarboxylation product were calculated. The reaction is less exergonic when carbonic acid, bicarbonate ion, or carbonate ion is the primary decarboxylation product compared to anhydrous carbon dioxide. The free-energy of the reaction is not biologically available to the bacteria; with carbon dioxide not the primary decarboxylation product, the potential energy lost in a <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> is not as great as previously considered.

40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of organic acids in wine is {{important part of}} fermentation monitoring during winemaking and can be an additional support for sensorial and microbiological quality of wines. The levels of organic acids must be carefully controlled to enable proper fermentation and to prevent spoilage. Organic acids of 21 red, 4 rose and 26 white wines, harvested 2007, from different wine regions in R. Macedonia, were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC-DAD). Separation of the acids was performed with C 18 column (250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 μm) and isocratic elution using aqueous solution of phosphoric acid, pH 2. 2, was applied for separation of the analytes. Determination of acids was made by direct injection after the appropriate sample dilution and filtration.

The ligand—in addition to its reduction action—provides a robust coating to gold nanoparticles and a catalytic function. Lactate oxidase (LOx) catalyzes the conversion of l-lactate to pyruvate in the presence of oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide, which is catalytically oxidized at 3, 4 DHS–AuNPs modified screen-printed carbon electrodes at + 0. 2 V. The measured electrocatalytic current is directly proportional to the concentration of peroxide, which is related to the amount of lactate present in the sample. The developed biosensor shows a detection limit of 2. 6 μM lactate and a sensitivity of 5. 1 ± 0. 1 μA·mM− 1.

40|$|Prevention of {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) accumulation through pre-harvest {{management is}} the best method to control mycotoxin contamination; however, the contamination should occur, so the hazards associated with the toxin must be managed through post-harvest procedures. The assignment of CCPs is important to make HACCP effective and is essential to prevent or to eliminate a food safety hazard or to reduce it to an acceptable level. Grapes selection is a preventive measure and the good manufacture practices in winemaking can work as corrective action for reducing contamination. According to all the experiments that were conducted under “Wine-Ochra Risk” {{the results show that}} no OTA is produced during winemaking, but each operation during winemaking can modify OTA content. OTA passes from grapes into the juice during crushing, the maceration increases OTA content, the alcoholic and <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> cause an OTA reduction. During all clarification steps (either natural sedimentation or by the use of adjuvant), the level of ochratoxin A decreases because of its adsorption into the sediment. The ochratoxin A reduction due to the natural sedimentation is small, while the decrease due to the use of adjuvant depends on the type and amount of adjuvant. In order to manage the hazard of OTA in winemaking and to verify if OTA content in wine is lower than the legal limit of 2 ug/L, it would be enough to analyze OTA in must and in wine at the end of alcoholic fermentation, since the following steps cause the OTA reduction. According to the results, it is expected that a significant decrease in ochratoxin A concentration occur from grape at harvest to wine if the following good manufacture practices are achieved: •	Minimize the time interval between harvest and crushing; refrigerate the grapes when crushing will not take place in a short time •	Discard bunches with visible mould grown (specially black moulds) •	Add sulphur dioxide to grapes •	Control OTA level in must after crushing •	In case of high OTA risk, reduce the maceration time, use yeast, lactic acid bacteria, and chemical adjuvants proven to be effective against OTA...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the {{qualitative}} and quantitative determination of biogenic amines (BA) and amino acids (AA), in particular the essential AA, in different food matrices typical of Sardinia (Italy). The study was focused on wines and table olives, which are potential source of biogenic amines due to their fermentation processes involved in their production. The decision to follow this research field {{is based on the}} importance of having updated information to assess the actual risk from ingesting BA, produced by decarboxylation of AA by microorganisms. These molecules, in fact, have direct or indirect effects on the human vascular and nervous system, especially in people who are sensitive to these substances or in people with specific diseases and/or subjected to particular therapies that affect the normal metabolism. From the legal standpoint, the legislation is developing and it is necessary to collect data in order to improve the control measures for food safety. First step of the doctorate project was to set up an analytical method of high sensitivity simultaneous detection and quantification of BA and AA in food. The method was developed using selective derivatisation with dansyl chloride and HPLC with fluorescence detection and chromatographic separation of 36 compounds, 13 BA and 22 AA, ammonium ion was successfully achieved. BA and AA were dosed using calibration curves built with the internal standard method (norvaline). This method was validated according to ICH Topic Q 2 (R 1) 1995 guidelines with the determination of a linearity range, r 2, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), intra and inter-day repeatability, and recovery. In cooperation with several local vineries, a survey on BA and AA amount in Cannonau, Vermentino, Carignano e Vernaccia wines, the four most typical “Controlled Designation of Origin” wines from Sardinia was performed. Sixty-one samples were analyzed, and 33 compounds (between BA and amino acids AA) were identified and quantified in the wines analyzed. Carignano wine is particularly rich in BA compounds, while Vermentino wine has a concentration of BA lower than other wine analyzed. Putrescine, histamine and tyramine are the BA found in higher concentration, but usually their amount is lower than 10 mg/L. -Aminobutyric acid is very concentrate in Vermentino wine, with an average value of 130. 3 ± 44. 8 mg/L. About AA compounds, the highest total concentration is in Vermentino wine, and proline is always the most representative AA. Subsequently, a trial has been set in order to investigate the production of biogenic amines during the winemaking fermentation processes. The experiment was carried out in collaboration with the Agris (Sardinian Regional Agency for Agricultural Research) on three types of characteristic wines of Sardinia: Cannonau, Vermentino and Moscato. The musts of Cannonau, Vermentino and Moscato were treated with different strains of yeast and bacteria starter, and the evolution of the concentration of BA and AA (especially the essential AA) was monitored. Comparing the data obtained, it was observed that the three types of wine at the end of fermentation have interesting differences. It can be noted that the wine Cannonau is particularly rich in nitrogen compounds compared to the two white wines, probably because of the <b>malo-lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> that does not take place in the other two wines. The Vermentino and Moscato are more similar to each other. In general, it was observed that the choice of starter turns out to be of significant impact in the formation of BA, though not all of the starter can make a difference. Furthermore, neither worrying values of histamine nor of tyramine were observed. Finally, an experimentation regarding the table olives, a fermented product very popular in all Mediterranean area, was developed. Sampling was carried out on a typical Sardinian olive cultivar, the ‘Nera di Gonnos’, and transformation followed the traditional natural fermentation. The HPLC-FLD method used for the wines was modified and validated for the olives. The analyses were conducted during the different steps of fermentation and after one year. Fifteen compounds, between AA and AB, were identified. The obtained data revealed that during the production process there is an increase of formation of nitrogen compounds in general, but the presence in table olives of histamine and tyramine is significantly below the values considered dangerous. In conclusion, a useful, reliable and easily applied HPLC-FLD method to monitor and safeguard the quality and safety of food products was developed. The traditional products from Sardinia showed a general good quality. It would be interesting also to extend the research by selecting and testing other microbial strains in order to obtain products with a lower content of BA and higher essential AA or other useful AA, such as Arg, that have important beneficial effects, yielding products with high qualit...|$|E
