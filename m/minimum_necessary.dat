500|$|Star Wars {{literature}} {{states that}} Sienar Fleet Systems manufactures TIE fighters and most TIE variants. TIE fighters' solar panels power a twin ion engine (TIE) system that accelerates gases {{at a high}} speed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability. Described as lacking a hyperdrive or shield generators, the fragile TIE fighters are deployed in large numbers from bases or larger ships; a Star Destroyer carries a wing of 72 various TIE craft. Expanded Universe material holds that TIE fighter pilots, who undergo intense physical and psychological testing, are trained to be intensely loyal to Emperor Palpatine and the Empire, willing to sacrifice themselves and their wingmates to accomplish their mission. TIE pilots were seen as expendable assets, as it was far cheaper to manufacture {{a great deal of}} standardized spacecraft in overwhelming numbers than it was to fully equip the craft. A TIE fighter consists of the absolute <b>minimum</b> <b>necessary</b> to function as a spacecraft, being essentially nothing more than a cockpit with an engine and weapons. Although Expanded Universe material often describes TIE fighters as lacking an ejection seat, the player can eject from TIE craft in LucasArts' [...] flight simulator.

2500|$|The {{artisans}} {{and workers}} of Paris had a precarious existence. [...] 73% {{of the residents}} of the working-class areas earned a daily salary between 3.25 and 6 francs; 22% earned less than three francs. [...] Only 5% had a salary between 6.5 francs to 20 francs. Food cost a minimum of one franc a day, and the <b>minimum</b> <b>necessary</b> for lodging was 75 centimes a day. [...] In most industries, except those connected with food, there was a long morte-saison ("dead season"), when the enterprises closed down and their workers were unpaid. [...] To support a family properly, either the wife and children had to work, or the husband had to work on Sundays or longer hours than normal. [...] The situation for women was even worse; the average salary for a woman was only two francs a day.

Although the trial was set for February 1, 1971, the plaintiffs and ACLU {{declined}} to seek a temporary injunction against the display in December 1970 in favor of a permanent resolution of the issue. On November 3, 1971, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Allen v. Morton, 333 F.Supp. 1088, (D.D.C. 1971), that inclusion of the nativity display did not violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. The court said {{that the purpose of the}} event was purely secular (to increase tourism and shopping in the city), and that was determinative. But on September 26, 1973, a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's ruling. [...] The appellate court held that the commercial nature of the event did not mean that the creche lost its religious meaning, and that the government's involvement in displaying the creche was not the absolute <b>minimum</b> <b>necessary</b> to meet the Supreme Court's constitutional tests. The appellate court did not explicitly bar the government from allowing the nativity display, but laid out very specific rules under which the government's participation could occur. Beginning in 1973, the American Christian Heritage Association (a group based in Prince George's County, Maryland) began hosting a private nativity display complete with live animals on The Ellipse.|$|E

On 12 November, Hitler ordered in Directive 18, that a panzer division be prepared to move to North Africa and even this was cancelled after the Italian advance into Egypt in [...] After the magnitude of the Italian defeat during Operation Compass was realised, Hitler issued Directive 22 on 11 January 1941, ordering the dispatch of a [...] (blocking detachment) [...] (Operation Sunflower), to begin. On 3 February, Hitler agreed to send another panzer division to join the 5th Light Afrika Division (Generalmajor Johann von Ravenstein); the first German troops reached Libya on 14 February and the first tanks on 20 February. A panzer corps of two divisions had been recommended by General Hans von Funck after a visit to Libya in January and by General Enno von Rintelen, the senior military attaché in Rome but Hitler agreed only to send another panzer regiment; the other elements of the 15th Panzer Division (Oberst Maximilian von Herff) began to arrive in late April.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1906 earthquake, {{the house}} had been seven stories high, but today it is only four stories. The house is {{predominantly}} made of redwood, as Mrs. Winchester preferred the wood; however, she disliked the look of it. She therefore demanded that a faux grain and stain be applied. This is why almost all the wood in the home is covered. Approximately [...] of paint were required to paint the house. The home itself is built using a floating foundation that is believed to have saved it from total collapse in the 1906 earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. This type of construction allows the home to shift freely, as it is not completely attached to its brick base. There are roughly 161 rooms, including 40 bedrooms, 2 ballrooms (one completed and one unfinished) as well as 47 fireplaces, over 10,000 panes of glass, 17 chimneys (with evidence of two others), two basements and three elevators.

60|$|The Union armies {{were now}} divided into {{nineteen}} departments, though {{four of them}} in the West had been concentrated into a single military division. The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had no territorial limits. There were thus seventeen distinct commanders. Before this time these various armies had acted separately and independently of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often of depleting one command, not pressed, to reinforce another more actively engaged. I determined to stop this. To this end I regarded the Army of the Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the line described as our position at the time, and north of it, the right wing; the Army of the James, under General Butler, as the left wing, and all the troops south, as a force in rear of the enemy. Some of these latter were occupying positions from which they could not render service proportionate to their numerical strength. All such were depleted to the <b>minimum</b> <b>necessary</b> to hold their positions as a guard against blockade runners; where they could not do this their positions were abandoned altogether. In this way ten thousand men were added to the Army of the James from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore in command. It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should leave his department; but as most of his troops were taken, presumably for active service, he asked to accompany them and was permitted to do so. Officers and soldiers on furlough, of whom there were many thousands, were ordered to their proper commands; concentration was the order of the day, and to have it accomplished in time to advance at the earliest moment the roads would permit was the problem.|$|E
