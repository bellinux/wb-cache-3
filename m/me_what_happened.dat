500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: [...] "Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
