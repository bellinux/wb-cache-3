The rise in use of mobile phones to perform financial transactions also increases the risks associated with such transactions and especially man in the middle attacks. These compounded with lack of awareness among users means that they (the users) are highly exposed to such attacks. Due to the popular use of mobile banking in Kenya and the third world in particular, securing communication between the mobile device and the back end server has become a fundamental issue. This {{is due to the fact}} that hackers have the ability to steal banking information using various techniques, particularly the duping of mobile phone users to believe that they are communicating with a genuine program from their bank while in reality a user is simple giving away sensitive information to the hacker.

40|$|Context: The {{invention}} of mobile phones makes the human life easier. The {{purpose of this}} study is to identify security risks in <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> and to provide an authentication method for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> <b>transaction</b> by using bio-metric mechanism. Objectives: Current <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> authentication is challenging and identified as a major security risk. Literature review shows that customer distrusts <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> due to security issues. The authors discuss security risks in current authentication methods in <b>mobile</b> <b>banking.</b> Methods: There are different methods and approaches to handle authentication in <b>mobile</b> <b>banking.</b> In this thesis, we propose a new approach of authentication in <b>mobile</b> <b>banking.</b> The strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches of authentication are identified with the help of Literature Review and interviews. The authors present basic transaction model and include security risks. By Literature Review it is found that finger print mechanism is a suitable method for authentication. Authors focus on authentication method and present a biometric scanning device which can identify the customer’s finger print thus enabling the customer to access <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> facility. Results: An authentication model is proposed through design process. The proposed biometric design was validated by conducting a workshop. The analysis of the workshop’s results showed that customer’s trust in security for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> will be increased by finger print mechanism. To promote <b>mobile</b> <b>banking,</b> it is necessary to improve customer trust in terms of security. Conclusions: The authors concluded that, only authorized person will be able to use <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> services by incorporating bio-metric finger-print mechanism. By literature review and interview it was found that finger-print mechanism is more suitable than other ordinary mechanisms like login and password mechanism, SMS etc. Using mobile phones for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking,</b> customers can push or pull the details like Funds transfer, Bill payment, Share trade, Check order and also inquiries like Account balance, Account statement and Check status Transaction history etc. It means that the customer is interacting with the files, databases etc., of the bank. Database at the server end is sensitive in terms of security. Customers distrust mobile devices to transfer money or for making any transactions. The reason is that security is a major concern for the customer’s fulfillment. Customer’s main concern in using mobile devices for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> is the authentication method used to ensure that the right person is accessing the services like transaction etc. The authors made a basic model for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> <b>transaction.</b> All security risks were included in the transaction model. Then the authors focused on authentication method. By literature review and interview it was concluded that security can be improved by bio metric methods. The authors focused on different bio-metric mechanism and concluded that fingerprint mechanism is more suitable as it requires less storage capacity in database and identifies the uniqueness of customers. The authors suggest a possible solution by proposing finger-print mechanism model and designed a bio-metric scanning device as a solution through which customer can interact with banking system using their finger-print. The result of workshop shows that bio-metric finger print mechanism is more suitable and secure then other authentication methods for <b>mobile</b> <b>banking.</b> 00453184779...|$|R

If the Location happens to be a Bank Branch or an ATM, where there is a proper iBeacon or GPS providing additional information about identification, then in such a situation the Authentication can be further simplified based on the type of transaction.

The purpose of the research presented within this dissertation is to explore an alternative method for identifying and authenticating a user in order to authorize a purchase made from a mobile device. The research will include evidence for the necessity of an alternative process as well as investigate the current technology by examining a few <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> solutions provided by the banking sector. The alternative process will be based upon a prototype design, which will employ Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to forward the purchase information from a point-of-sale (POS) device to the client’s mobile device, as well as employ fingerprint recognition technology to improve the identification and authentication of a user in order to authorize the purchase. The prototype will be known as BankAuth. The researcher hopes that this dissertation encourages other academics to discover new approaches in further researching <b>mobile</b> <b>banking</b> solutions...|$|R
