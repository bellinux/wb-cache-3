40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the problems of injection moulding conditions on <b>moulding</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and the post-moulding shrinkage of thermoplastic mouldings. The thesis places emphasis on two materials: ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) and elastomer modified talc-filled polypropylene. Both materials are used for manufacturing of lacquered parts in the automobile industry. The experimental part evaluates effect of the wall thickness, melt temperature and the mould temperature on the shrinkage, when the post-moulding shrinkage of injection moulded slab specimens is determined after annealing. Annealing time and temperature was set like imitated the real temperature course during the painting process of real injection moulded parts. The specialized software STRIMFLOW was used for numeric simulation of injection moulding of ABS specimens and assessment of their <b>moulding</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The results obtained by the experiment were compared with the STRIMFLOW-simulation for selected moulding conditions. The results of the thesis offer information about the <b>moulding</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and the post-moulding shrinkage of elected materials and it is useful for assessment of the lacquered mouldings deformation.

40|$|Background: In 2007 alone, twenty six {{foundries}} {{were closed}} {{down when the}} castings industries directory was released. A high scrap rate {{due to a lack}} of quality management is one of the root causes of low productivity and low profits, resulting in closures. Method: This research paper focusses on the impact of defects on productivity and monetary losses due to poor utilisation of the quality management system in sand casting. Data was gathered on defects and productivity and the company’s quality control records were used for monetary losses due to scrap. The study was conducted over a period of one year at a South African foundry. The standard multiple regression analysis method was used to assess the ability of five defects (cross jointed, bad <b>mould,</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> core fault, and gas porosity) to predict monetary and productivity losses. Results: Cross jointed and bad mould defects had a correlation coefficient of 0. 727 and 0. 716 respectively which indicated a strong positive correlation. The overall variance explained by the model was 61 %, F = 16. 263, p<. 005. Thus the prevalence of these two types of defects can significantly predict monetary losses, while core fault predicted productivity. Conclusion: Foundry should concentrate on eliminating cross jointed and bad mould defects to avoid a high scrap rate, and core fault to improve productivity...|$|R
40|$|Gypsum {{is used as}} binder in {{traditional}} moulding sand system for non-ferrous casting. New Zealand silica sand is the best sand as near white, high purity (silica 99. 32 %) {{can be used for}} foundry application. An attempt has been made to use this material system in 3 DP systems to study the behaviour and suitability to print moulds for non-ferrous casting with and without coating application at various baking conditions. The result shows that the importance of the calcination and the relation between the density and porosity, when density increases the mould strength increases but the porosity decreases and it is understood that the baking temperature and the type of coating influence the surface roughness. The dimensional error result shows the percentage swelling and shrinkage errors which is non-linear, but the result shows 0. 5 % shrinkage in lateral axis, 1 % in horizontal axis, and 5 % in vertical axis. Based on the volume the average error is been drastically reduced from 64. 5 % to 6. 5 %. These result shows that the <b>mould</b> <b>shrinkage</b> can be reduced by further optimizing the baking condition and or adding suitable additives. There were no casting defects like mould wash, mould burn or distortion, and etc. It shows that the gypsum bonded mould have enough mould strength for casting at various conditions. In general surface roughness is the main concern in sand casting, it can be improved by adding suitable additives and coatings. Compare with two bench marked values the tensile strength value is higher and it’s proved that the locally available material system used to print moulds by 3 DP is not an inferior with commercially availabl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular polymer processing methods due to its high production rate as well as its ability to produce very intricate geometries at very cheaper cost and within few seconds. There are several flaws which occur while producing plastic parts by Injection <b>moulding,</b> like warpage, <b>shrinkage,</b> flash, sink marks etc. Shrinkage {{is one of the}} most critical problems which causes dimensional changes in the parts during the <b>moulding</b> process. <b>Shrinkage</b> can be minimized by setting optimal process parameters on injection moulding machine. In this study, optimal injection moulding conditions for minimum <b>shrinkage</b> during <b>moulding</b> are found by DOE technique (Taguchi method). Different observations were taken for a material namely Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE). Taguchi method is used to investigate the effects of melting temperature, injection pressure, refilling pressure and cooling time on the shrinkage of LDPE. Taguchi method has two main instruments, which are signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and orthogonal arrays. S/N ratios were used for determining the optimum combinations of the process conditions for shrinkage. The S/N ratio takes both the average and the variability of the quality characteristics into consideration. The results showed that the cooling time was the most effective factor for LDPE followed by refilling pressure and injection pressure was found to be the least effective factor.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Design for Reliability modelling of several System-in-Package (SiP) structures developed by NXP and advanced {{on the basis}} of Wafer Level Packaging (WLP). Two different types of Wafer Level SiP (WLSiP) are presented and discussed. The main focus is on the modelling approach that has been adopted to investigate and analyse the board level reliability of the presented SiP configurations. Thermo-mechanical non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to analyse the effect of various package design parameters on the reliability of the structures and to identify design trends towards package optimisation. FEA is used also to gain knowledge on <b>moulded</b> wafer <b>shrinkage</b> and related issues during the wafer level fabrication. The paper provides a brief outline and demonstration of a design methodology for reliability driven design optimisation of SiP.

40|$|Forming {{of fabric}} {{composites}} into complex parts such as double curvature shells leads to complex redistribution and reorientation of fibres in the composite. This study {{deals with the}} prediction of the shrinkage coefficient of fabric composite, the fibre reorientation and layer thickness variation during forming of fabric composites {{as well as the}} resulting residual stress and deformation after <b>moulding.</b> The <b>shrinkage</b> coefficient is evaluated using the classical laminate theory and the non-linear extension. The fibre reorientation is predicted using the pin-jointed net theory. The layer thickness variation is calculated according to single die moulding. A finite element model using calculated rearrangement of the laminate is generated for the residual distortion prediction of the complex part. A model for the analysis of the mechanical behaviour of fabric composite, based on the mosaic model, is presented and used in the finite element model. The prediction of the rearrangement of the laminate and the distortion were compared to experiments on rounded top cone parts.

40|$|Micro {{moulding}} process {{studies have been}} carried out using a Battenfeld Microsystem moulding machine with a maximum melt injection capacity of 1 cm. Micro moulds with different designs were used to study melt shear effect during the process. Both amorphous and crystalline polymers, including PMMA, PC, POM, PBT, PP and a PC/LCP blend were evaluated in the study. It has been found that, while the metering size is the dominating factor that affects the process, the mould temperature, melt temperature and injection speed can also affect the <b>mould</b> filling behaviour. <b>Shrinkage</b> and the speed of melt solidification are the two important material factors that need to be considered in the process condition setting.

40|$|During the {{injection}} moulding process, {{the material is}} subjected to successive transformations, being submitted to a thermo-mechanical environment that determines the final dimensions of the part. This environment is characterized by several parameters which are related to material properties, the mould design, equipment and process variables. As a result, deviations of {{the dimensions of the}} moulded parts from the dimensions of the cavity cannot be avoided. If differences on shrinkage occur, caused for example by anisotropies of the material or non-uniform cooling, distortions will happen. In order to predict this two effects on {{the injection}} cycles is require one strategy to monitoring and control the process variables. The aim is to achieve highest quality control of all manufacture parts.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} determination of relative length changes development during cement based composite ageing. Special moulds with the dimensions 100 × 60 × 1000 mm {{were used for the}} measurements. These moulds were filled and placed on an advanced weighing table that enables continuous recording of mass losses caused by free drying of the specimen surface. In this way, the mass losses and changes in the length of the cement composite in the moulds were measured simultaneously. The <b>shrinkage</b> <b>moulds</b> were modified in order to measure also the long-term relative deformation of fine-aggregate concrete specimens as a result of drying. The outputs of the measurement are given {{in the form of the}} diagrams displaying the relationship between the relative length changes or the mass losses and the time of cement composites ageing. Besides the measurement of length changes, three-point bending fracture tests at the age of 3 and 28 days were also performed.

40|$|Dimensional {{influences}} of specimen size on the volumetric shrinkage strain {{values of a}} lateritic soil for waste containment system have not been researched upon. Therefore, this paper presents {{the result of a}} laboratory study on the volumetric shrinkage strain (VSS) of lateritic soil at three different dimensional sizes of mould (split former mould, proctor mould and California bearing ratio mould) at three energy levels; British standard light (BSL), West African standard (WAS) and British standard heavy (BSH) respectively. Compactions were done at different molding water content of - 2 % to + 6 % optimum moisture content (OMC). At - 2 % to + 2 % molding water content for the split former <b>mould</b> the volumetric <b>shrinkage</b> strain met the requirement of not more than 4 % while at + 4 % and + 6 % only the WAS and BSH met the requirement. The proctor mould and the CBR mould on the other hand gave a lower value of volumetric shrinkage strain in all compactive effort and the values are lower than the 4 % safe VSS suggested by Tay et al., (2001). Based on the VSS values obtained if the CBR mould can be used to model site condition it is recommended for use to simulate site condition for Volumetric shrinkage strain for all molding water content and compactive effort...|$|R
40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in reverse ratio to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor proof flexible tube <b>mould.</b> The plastic <b>shrinkage</b> cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the ring-test and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the ring-test method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|R
