25|$|When Yugoslavia won {{the gold}} in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, fans rushed onto the court. One of them was holding a Croatian flag, {{one of the six}} republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the <b>man</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a {{derogatory}} remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long before}} Operation Red Wings had occurred, {{relations}} with the Americans had improved in the Shuryek Valley and the greater Pech river region because of humanitarian work that had been occurring.

The Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah, knew that the wounded <b>man</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was tracking had {{to pass through the}} village of Salar Ban as he contoured downhill. Through intimidation Shah was able to ascertain which house sheltered the wounded man and demanded that he be turned over. But Shah couldn't risk a fight at that moment because he was outnumbered and other relatives and villagers would come to Gulab's aid. Luttrell was subsequently moved to different places until forces could arrive to extract him.|$|E
