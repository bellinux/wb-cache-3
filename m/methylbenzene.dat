The packing is a conductive material, serving both as a stationary phase and as a working electrode. Chromatographic retention is manipulated through changes in the potential applied to the stationary phase (Eapp) which alters interfacial properties such as surface charge and double layer structure. The stationary phase can thus {{be viewed as a}} compositionally tunable packing, with retention properties that can be adjusted to enhance separation efficiency. EMLC separations have been carried out {{to a wide variety of}} analyte mixtures, including aromatic sulfonates, monosubstituted benzenes and corticosteroids. EMLC can also be used as a tool for investigating electrosorption processes. The main goal of this dissertation is advance insights into the retention mechanism for EMLC. Previous works with charged analytes demonstrated the impact of ionic solute-stationary phase interactions in EMLC retention. The potential-dependent retention of neutral solutes implies a mechanism beyond electrostatics. Simple, neutral aromatic solutes are employed as test solutes to examine this fundamental issue. Benzene and a series of alkylbenzenes, and di- and tri- <b>methylbenzenes</b> are chosen in particular to probe EMLC-based retention with respect to solute structure and properties.

In addition, various factors that influence EMLC retention of alkylbenzenes and <b>methylbenzenes</b> are investigated.

40|$|To {{meet the}} ever {{increasing}} demand for oil-based chemicals {{in spite of}} waning oil reserves, {{the development of new}} technologies based on alternative feedstock is high on the agenda of both academic and industrial communities. One of the most promising emerging technologies is the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process in acidic zeolites. Despite considerable efforts from both experimental and theoretical research, the reaction mechanism has proven to be extremely difficult to unravel. Experimental results advocate a hydrocarbon pool mechanism, in which organic centers inside the zeolite pores act as co-catalysts. [1, 2] Recently, a complete such catalytic cycle has been studied from a combined theoretical and experimental viewpoint,[3] but it still fails to explain ethene formation witnessed in H-ZSM- 5. [4] Polymethylbenzenes have been commonly regarded as the most important hydrocarbon pool species, independent of the employed zeolite. While this assumption still holds for zeolites with the BEA- or CHA-structure, recent experiments have shown that H-ZSM- 5 (in which space is more limited, due to the MFI-topology) could be an important exception. Researchers found that the higher <b>methylbenzenes,</b> even though present, are virtually unreactive in the pores of H-ZSM- 5. Recent experimental results, however, revived the old proposal of successive methylation and cracking reactions of C 3 +-alkenes instead, providing a parallel route for the production of light olefins. In a more detailed study by Svelle et al. ethene appears to be formed solely from the lower <b>methylbenzenes,</b> while propene and higher alkenes would be formed from alkene methylations and interconversions. These observations led to the proposal of a complete dual cycle mechanism, consisting of two interconnected cycles: a polymethylbenzene cycle that yields predominantly ethene, and an alkene cycle that yields propene and higher alkenes. [5, 6] In this study, the C 3 +-alkene cycle is modeled using quantum-chemical techniques to identify a complete low energy pathway, to verify whether olefin formation proceeds through this route and whether propene formation is indeed preferred. Since the proposed dual cycle might eventually allow control of the propene-to-ethene ratio, a thorough understanding and comparison of all elementary steps is of utmost importance...|$|R

With a proper concentration of fluoride, not only the propylene selectivity but also the catalyst stability could be enhanced significantly. We have demonstrated that the acidity and the pore structure are two crucial factors determining the catalytic behaviors. The weaker acidity of the fluoride-treated H-ZSM- 5 suppressed the hydrogen-transfer and aromatization reactions, leading to higher selectivity to light olefins.

This reaction was not dependent {{on the presence of}} coenzyme A (CoA) or ATP. In the presence of CoA, formation of E-phenylitaconate from benzylsuccinate was also observed. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the specific rate of benzylsuccinate formation from toluene and fumarate in assays with permeabilized cells was > 30 % of the specific rate of toluene consumption in whole-cell suspensions with nitrate; this observation suggests that benzylsuccinate formation may be the first reaction in anaerobic toluene degradation by strain T. Use of deuterium-labeled toluene and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the H atom abstracted from the toluene methyl group during addition to fumarate was retained in the succinyl moiety of benzylsuccinate. In this study, no evidence was found to support previously proposed reactions of toluene with acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA. Toluene-grown, permeabilized cells of strain T also catalyzed the addition of o-xylene to fumarate to form (2 -methylbenzyl) succinate. o-Xylene is not a growth substrate for strain T, and its transformation was probably cometabolic.

By using the reporter system described, we found that TouR responds to mono- and dimethylphenols, but not the corresponding <b>methylbenzenes.</b> In this respect, the regulation of the P. stutzeri system differs from that of other toluene or xylene catabolic systems, in which the hydrocarbons themselves function as effectors. Northern analyses indicated low transcription levels of tou structural genes in the absence of inducers. Basal toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase activity may thus transform these compounds to phenols, which then trigger the TouR-mediated response...|$|R
