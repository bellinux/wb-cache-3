A protocol is fair if no protocol participant can gain any useful advantage over honest participants by misbehaving. In addition, such a protocol is fault tolerant if the protocol can ensure no loss of fairness to an honest participant despite the occurrence of failures of the assumed type. Fault tolerant fair exchange protocols have not been studied adequately. This paper remedies the situation by systematically developing a family of fair exchange protocols for two participants under a variety of assumptions concerning participant misbehaviour, message delays and node failures. The treatment presented not only shows how a non-fault tolerant version of a protocol can be made fault tolerant, but also highlights the subtle relationships that exist between fairness and fault tolerance...|$|R

In this setting, we view MLGSs as a wealth pooling mechanism that allows otherwise inefficiently rationed borrowers to obtain credit. We focus on the case of large, complex urban economies where potential entrepreneurs are numerous and possess no more information about each other than do banks. Despite our extreme assumption on information availability, we show that MLGSs can be characterized by assortative matching in which only safe borrowers have an incentive to join the mutual society. In the last section, we show that the available evidence on the structure and performance of MLGSs active in Italy is consistent with some implications of our theory concerning their diffusion, the average number of their associates and the average default rate on guaranteed loans in developed and backward regions. group information, <b>mutual</b> loan <b>guarantee</b> society, small business lending...|$|R

When Bolivia threatened to confiscate the company's property, Chilean armed forces occupied the port city of Antofagasta on Feb. 14, 1879. Bolivia then imposed a presidential decree that confiscated all Chilean property in Bolivia, which Chile understood as a declaration of war. The government of La Paz next called for Peruvian aid in accordance to the defensive alliance both nations had made in 1873, but Peru tried to negotiate a peaceful solution between Bolivia and Chile in order to avoid war. Chile, after finding out about the defensive alliance of Bolivia and Peru, demanded for Peru to remain neutral, and the Peruvian government decided to discuss both the Chilean and Bolivian proposal in a congressional meeting. However, before Peru was able to provide a decision, on April 5, 1879, war was officially declared when Chile declared war on both Bolivia and Peru.|$|E

A protocol is fair if no protocol participant can gain any advantage over an honest participant by misbehaving. In addition, such a protocol is fault tolerant if the protocol can ensure that an honest participant does not suffer any loss of fairness despite any failures of the participant’s node. This paper presents a family of fair exchange protocols for two participants under a variety of assumptions concerning participant misbehaviour, node reliability and message delays. While the paper considers, in line with other known protocols, that a dishonest user can control the protocol execution subject to known cryptographic assumptions, it also considers a class of dishonest users whose abilities to abuse are restricted. The restricted-abuse assumption results in a round-optimal (2 -round) protocol that eliminates any need for an “after-the-fact ” dispute resolution, using traditional symmetric keys and the RSA signatures. The paper also indicates how this assumption can be realised through the use of smart cards. Concerning the node reliability, the development presented here shows how a non-fault tolerant version of a protocol can be made crash-tolerant, thereby highlighting issues that need to be addressed in such transformation. The third dimension concerns the case of the bound on message delays being known or unknown...|$|R
