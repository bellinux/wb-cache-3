40|$|Aflatoxins (AF), a {{group of}} closely related, {{extremely}} toxic mycotoxins, produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus can occur as natural contaminants of foods and feeds. Aflatoxins {{have been shown to}} be hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic to different animal species. Zizyphus spina-christi L. extract was investigated for its antifungal and antimicrobial activities. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the methanol extract of Z. spina-christi L. leaves against the oxidative stress of aflatoxin in rats. Fourty male Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into four groups including the control group, the group fed aflatoxin-contaminated diet (3 mg/kg diet) and the groups treated <b>with</b> <b>Zizyphus</b> extract (5 mg/kg b. w) alone or in combination with AF for 15 days. Biochemical analysis reveled that treatment with AF resulted in a significant increase in ALT, AST, cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, TNFa, LPO, NO and CEA, whereas it decrease significantly GPX and SOD. The histopatholgical examination of the liver, kidney and testis showed sever histological changes typical to those reported for aflatoxicosis. Animals treated <b>with</b> <b>Zizyphus</b> extract alone or plus AF showed a significant improvement in all biochemical parameters and histological picture of liver, kidney and testis. It could be concluded that Zizyphus extract have a power protective role against aflatoxicosis...|$|R
40|$|Radiotracking of two {{roe deer}} Capreolus capreolus (1 female, 1 male) in a Mediterranean habitat (<b>Matorrals)</b> <b>with</b> a {{detailed}} analysis of the vegetation showed that within their annual home range the deers selected particular habitat types, according to the season. The northern slope was preferred by both animals. Comparatively to female, male had a larger annual home range (150 ha vs. 130 ha), composed of more widely scattered sites of preferred use in more seasonal vs variable habitat types. Habitat selection in different seasons was affected by several factors: i) in all seasons, abundance of Rubus ulmifolius and Rosa ssp., ii) strong winds, especially in winter, that caused the male to move to southern slope, iii) disturbance by hunting dogs in autumn that forced deers into one or two refuge zones, iv) aspect of deer biology, such as territory marking by the male and giving birth by the female, which modified not only behaviour but also use of space...|$|R

40|$|South American biomes are {{increasingly}} affected by land use/land cover change. However, the climatic impacts {{of this phenomenon}} are still not well understood. In this paper, we model vegetation-climate interactions {{with a focus on}} four main biomes distributed in four key regions: The Atlantic Forest, the Cerrado, the Dry Chaco, and the Chilean Matorral ecosystems. We applied a three member ensemble climate model simulation for the period 1981 - 2010 (30 years) at 25 km resolution over the focus regions to quantify the changes in the regional climate resulting from historical deforestation. The results of computed modelling experiments show significant changes in surface fluxes, temperature and moisture in all regions. For instance, simulated temperature changes were stronger in the Cerrado and the Chilean <b>Matorral</b> <b>with</b> an increase of between 0. 7 and 1. 4. °C. Changes in the hydrological cycle revealed high regional variability. The results showed consistent significant decreases in relative humidity and soil moisture, and increases in potential evapotranspiration across biomes, yet without conclusive changes in precipitation. These impacts were more significant during the dry season, which resulted to be drier and warmer after deforestation...|$|R

40|$|The “Serras de Aire e Candeeiros” Natural Park, in the Centre of Portugal, {{are mostly}} formed by {{limestone}} formations of the Middle Jurassic. Among the plant species located in this Protected Area, {{there are seven}} endemic species included in Annex II and/or IV of CEE/ 92 / 43 Directive by their rarity: Arabis sadina, Coincya cintrana, Iberis procumbens subsp. microcarpa, Juncus valvatus, Narcissus calcicola, Saxifraga cintrana and Silene longicilia. Other noteworthy plant species occurring in these limestone formations, although not included {{in any of the}} CEE/ 92 / 43 Directive annexes, are numerous orchid species and also Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. lusitanica, Crambe hispanica, Cytinus ruber, Dianthus cintranus subsp. barbatus, Jonopsidium abulense, Inula montana, Koeleria vallesiana, Orobanche latisquama, Scabiosa turolensis, Serratula baetica subsp. lusitanica, Serratula estremadurensis, and Teucrium chamaedrys, most of them of rare occurrence in Portugal. The vegetation of these hills, in its ridge line, consists of a mosaic of more or less degraded communities of the holm forest Lonicero implexae- Quercetum rotundifoliae. In the valleys and foothills of Serra dos Candeeiros, reaching as far as Minde, the Portuguese oak forest Arisaro-Quercetum broteroi dominates. In the last years, we verify the expansion of the arborescent <b>matorral</b> <b>with</b> the consequent decrease of grasslands {{as a result of the}} sucessional dynamics.

40|$|International audienceOf {{the many}} {{techniques}} tested to date to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems, topsoil transfer appears {{to offer the}} best results. However, this method is recent, and results achieved {{in the short term}} (months to years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970 s- 1980 s and are nearly all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic, security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test their efficacy in the 30 -year long-term. We used an ecological analysis of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different rehabilitation treatments: (1) soil transfer (40 cm) with no contact with the water table; (2) soil transfer (40 cm) in contact with the water table; (3) more than 40 cm of soil transfer and (4) anthropogenic material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt) (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian woodlands or <b>matorrals</b> <b>with</b> new variables and common variables to the historical ecosystem. Additional techniques to enhance the effectiveness of topsoil transfer are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Anecdotal evidence has suggested that, during the rutting period, female roe deer may undertake short excursions, outside of their normal home range, possibly to mate with a reproductive partner. To address this question, we analysed the ranging behaviour of 27 female roe deer Capreolus capreolus, equipped with GPS collars, inhabiting a fragmented landscape in France. We compared female movements during the rutting period with a non-rutting period over two summers using a recently published approach. Search intensity and home range size were significantly greater during the rutting period. The difference in home range size between the two periods was significantly greater in 2006 compared to 2005 and in open compared to closed habitat. We were not able to identify any influence of body mass on the difference in ranging behaviour between the two periods. Visual analysis of movement trajectories for 11 females revealed that 5 (45 %) performed an excursion for a duration of a few hours to several days. We speculatively suggest that female rut excursions provide an opportunity for active mate choice in roe deer, where males are territorial, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that these movements are a means to avoid male harassment...|$|R
40|$|Knemidocoptic mange is {{occasionally}} {{noted in}} pet chickens. The etiologic agent {{of this disease}} is Knemidocoptes gallinae and K. mutans, a sarcoptiform mite. These mites live out their entire life cycle on their hosts. Typically, the crusty and scaly dermatitis associated with this mite is seen at the feet and legs, as {{may be seen in}} some pet canaries or budgerigars with the same problem. Facial lesions, however, are particularly uncommonly seen in chickens. A suggestive diagnosis can be established by physical examination findings of a "honeycombed" appearance to the crusts and scales on the feet and legs, or by skin scraping. Treatment is with ivermectin, which may be repeated in 2 -week intervals for 2 to 3 total treatments. Not all birds exposed to a bird with this condition necessarily will develop problems, and group treatment is not necessarily always required Cedrus oil a herbal product was trid agains knemidocoptes gallinae and its efficacy was compared <b>with</b> of <b>Zizyphus</b> Extract and Rotenone-orthophenol.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{ecosystem}} processes {{is vital}} for developing dynamic adaptive management of human-dominated landscapes. We focus on conservation {{and management of the}} central Chilean silvopastoral savanna habitat called “espinal”, which often occurs near matorral, a shrub habitat. Although matorral, espinal and native sclerophyllous forest are linked successionally, they are not jointly managed and conserved. Management goals in “espinal” include increasing woody cover, particularly of the dominant tree Acacia caven, improving herbaceous forage quality, and increasing soil fertility. We asked whether adjacent matorral areas contribute to espinal ecosystem processes related to the three main espinal management goals. We examined input and outcome ecosystem processes related to these goals in <b>matorral</b> and espinal <b>with</b> and without shrub understory. We found that matorral had the largest sets of inputs to ecosystem processes, and espinal with shrub understory had the largest sets of outcomes. Moreover, we found that these outcomes were broadly in the directions preferred by management goals. This supports our prediction that matorral acts as an ecosystem process bank for espinal. We recommend that management plans for landscape resilience consider espinal and matorral as a single landscape cover class that should be maintained as a dynamic mosaic. Joint management of espinal and matorral could create new management and policy opportunities...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight Wistar female rats (6 - 8 weeks old 100 - 120 g of weight) were randomly assigned to saline-control (SC), saline-training (ST), zizyphus jujuba-control (ZJC), and zizyphus jujuba-training (ZJT) groups. Rats ran on a motor-driven treadmill at 35 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Animals received ZJ extraction and saline at the dose of 1. 25 mL/ 100 g of body weight. Seventy-two hours after the last training session rats were killed, a portion of liver excited, and plasma was collected for nesfatin- 1, ATP, and glycogen measurements. A one-way ANOVA method, and Pearson correlation were employed. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: A higher and significant liver nesfatin- 1 level was found in ZJ groups (p < 0. 005), but plasma nesfatin- 1 responded differently...|$|R
