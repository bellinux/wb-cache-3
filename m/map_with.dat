In {{recent years}} {{discontinuous}} maps, which are {{commonly referred to}} as <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> gaps, have been derived from applications, both electronic and mechanical, and {{it has been shown that}} these maps have suprisingly rich dynamics. In this paper we study a new class of maps which we refer to as regularised <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> gaps because they have very similar dynamics to <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> gaps but are yet continuous. We derive two examples of regularised <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> gaps from two mechanical applications, the impact oscillator and the cam-follower system.

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based <b>map,</b> <b>with</b> the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) {{was working for the}} Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded <b>map</b> <b>with</b> a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street <b>map</b> <b>with</b> directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of trails that linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese <b>map</b> <b>with</b> valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around the British 6th Airborne Division's attempts to secure Bénouville Bridge (later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in honour of the battle) over the Caen Canal during the Normandy landings on 5 June 1944. The player is able to command either the British or German side in the game.

German forces are distributed around the four far corners of the <b>map,</b> <b>with</b> a few units positioned near Bénouville Bridge. If playing as the British, the objective is to defeat all German forces and secure all bridges in the area, with the capture or destruction of the Merville Battery being the ultimate goal.

40|$|We study {{stochastic}} thermodynamics for {{a quantum}} system of interest whose dynamics are {{described by a}} completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map {{as a result of}} its interaction with a thermal bath. We define CPTP <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium as CPTP <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> an invariant state such that the entropy production due to the action of the map on the invariant state vanishes. Thermal maps are a subgroup of CPTP <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium. In general, for CPTP maps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy production or work performed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system plus its environment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system properties for <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid for arbitrary coupling strengths between the system and the thermal bath. The fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are considered in the framework of a two-point measurement scheme. We derive the entropy production fluctuation theorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on a system that starts in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the probability distributions in the case of <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium are presented. We illustrate our results by considering spin 1 / 2 systems under thermal <b>maps,</b> non-thermal <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium, <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> non-equilibrium steady states and concatenations of them. Finally, we consider a particular limit in which the concatenation of maps generates a continuous time evolution in Lindblad form for the system of interest, and we show that the concept of <b>maps</b> <b>with</b> and without equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum detailed balance, respectively. The consequences for the thermodynamic quantities in this limit are discussed. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures; new section added, typos correcte...|$|R
