50|$|An {{electric}} match (sometimes Igniter Safety Fuse Electric (ISFE)) {{lights a}} <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> or device when activated by an electric current. They typically {{consist of a}} pair of wires leading to a thin resistance wire that heats when current is applied. The resistance wire is covered by a bit of pyrotechnic composition that ignites from the wire heating, providing enough fire to reliably ignite the <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> via a mechanical connection, or the device directly. Estes model rocket motors are lit by a type of electric match. Large fireworks displays are launched with complex timing sequences using a computer that energizes electric matches connected to the individual device fuses.|$|R

In response to this, Lyndon Burgess sends in his black ops team, Overstrike 9, to investigate.

40|$|Abstract. Today, {{a variety}} of {{intrusion}} detection systems based on {{a variety of}} techniques and data sources exists. The alarms generated by these sensors need to be managed efficiently to generate an appropriate amount of alerts. This could be accomplished by <b>fusing</b> <b>alarms</b> from multiple sensors to report an attack only once, correlate alarms {{to reduce the number of}} false alarms and aggregate alarms to present attack scenarios. This paper proposes a method for reasoning about intrusion attacks by associating beliefs with each type of alarm and analyzing combinations of alarms by using Subjective logic. The advantage of this approach is that different types of alarms easily can be combined together to enhance the accuracy and trustworthiness of the results and allowing evidence coming from less reliable sources to be discounted accordingly. 1...|$|R

The explosion of the propelling charge sent the mine upwards {{into the air and}} activated three short-delay pellets between the propellant charge and the three detonators. These short-delay pellets delayed the mine's detonation long enough for it to reach an appropriate height before exploding.|$|R

The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper.

Economic analyses were conducted for 108 electricity supply points for scenarios including (1) a tax rebate, (2) an investment subsidy, and (3) both tax rebate and subsidy. First, PV systems were sized and oriented to give the highest net present values, considering actual fuse sizes and hourly demands matched to simulated PV generation. This resulted in shares of profitable systems as follows: 33 % with a tax rebate, 51 % with a subsidy, and 93 % with both. It was shown that the tax rebate programme promotes relatively large systems compared to the subsidy, although with a much higher risk. Thereafter, the influences of <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> size and existing roofs were investigated. Most of the roofs were large enough to fit the previously sized PV systems. However, taking into account the slopes and directions of available rooftops considerably reduced the number of profitable systems. Finally, the study showed that in addition to support measures and other economic conditions, the PV system feasibility was highly sensitive to roof characteristics, electricity demand and fuse size...|$|R

We embed the intrusion symptoms into the DHT dimensions so that alarms related to the same intrusion (thus with similar symptoms) will be routed to the same sensor fusion center (SFC) while evenly distributing unrelated alarms to different SFCs. This is achieved through careful routing key design based on: 1) analysis of essential characteristics of three common types of intrusions: DoS attacks, port scanning and virus/worm infection; and 2) distribution and stability analysis of the popular port numbers {{and those of the}} popular source IP subnets in scans.
