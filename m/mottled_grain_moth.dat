This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. Hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign grain beetle Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae).

40|$|Abstract—Experiments have {{showed that}} heat shock (45 °C during 30 min) caused a twofold {{increase}} in mortality of T. principium females recorded during {{two days after}} the shock. The percentage of females that have started parasitization of the <b>grain</b> <b>moth</b> eggs (among all survived females) sharply decreased (40 – 50 % and 30 % in controls and in treated females, respectively). Thus, the switch from egg retention to parasitization of less preferred hosts was not the result of “pathological ” changes in a senescent or dying wasp, but a “normal ” stage of adult life. Fe-males that have already started parasitization before the heat shock, continued to parasitize after the shock (differ-ences between treatments and controls were not significant). Obviously, the heat shock influence on oviposition was mostly indirect (as a cue factor) and the wasps that have already started parasitization, were insensitive to this cue. These data resemble the loss of sensitivity to the diapause-inducing factor which was often observed after re-activation. We conclude that the results of our study confirm analogies between egg retention and reproductive dia-pause.

Most of females delayed parasitization. The daily number of females starting to parasitize was maximal {{on the first day of}} contact with the host and then gradually declined. Practically all of the females started parasitization during the photophase. Moreover, when the first contact with the host fell on the scotophase, the total cumulative percentage of females that started parasitiza-tion during four days of the experiment significantly decreased. Oviposition activities of parasitizing females also occurred mainly during photophase. However, under constant light, these circadian rhythms were damped out after one cycle. In addition, anticipatory period of darkness during photophase directly inhibited parasitization. This suggests that the observed rhythms can be easily modified by the direct environmental influence. Under natural conditions, such a flexible oviposition rhythm may be of advantage for these parasitoids enabling them to use any opportunity for reproduction. In biocontrol practice, the lability of parasitization rhythms may enable Tricho-gramma females to adapt immediately to any new light–dark regimes, although darkness may have negative effects on their efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{efficacy}} of spinosad on hard white winter wheat was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} by exposing 25 adults of six species of beetles or 50 eggs of two moth species to 100 g of untreated wheat and wheat treated with spinosad at the rates of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1 mg(AI) /kg. Spinosad was more effective against insects at 1 mg(AI) /kg than at 0. 1 and 0. 5 mg(AI) /kg. All lesser grain borers, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); rusty grain beetles, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); rice weevils, Sitophilus oryzae (L.); maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky; and> 94 per cent of the red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum Herbst; and confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum (Jacquelin du Val), were killed after 14 days of exposure to spinosad at 1 mg(AI) /kg. At 1 mg(AI) /kg, no live larvae of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), were found after 21 days of exposure, and progeny production of all species of beetles and egg-to-adult emergence of P. interpunctella and the Angoumois <b>grain</b> <b>moth,</b> Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), was reduced by 98 – 100 per cent. Spinosad at 1 mg(AI) /kg provided 98 – 100 per cent protection of the hard white wheat kernels from damage by all insect species...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2004 to assess the major pests associated with stored maize, the damage and losses they cause in Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State. Fifty farm stores were assessed. Seventeen arthropods, thirteen Coleopterans, three Lepidopterans and one Acarina were documented from the samples collected. Maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) followed by <b>grain</b> <b>moth</b> (Sitotroga cereallela), rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) and flour beetle (Tribolium confusum) were the major pests of stored maize in the study area. A major finding of the {{experiment was}} that a storage pests particularly, S. zeamais is the dominant and most important pest of maize in Jimma Zone. This pest was found in abundance in all areas assessed damaging maize grain. Farmers want to store maize grain for food security, seed, and to sell when the prices are high enough. However, this pest is a major challenge. Quantitative average grain damage of 64. 50 % and losses of 41 to 80 % are common in the store within {{three to six months}} after storage. It is recommended that an integrated weevil management method should be implemented to prevent the high quantitative and qualitative grain losses incurred so as to contribute towards family food security in Jimma Zone...|$|R
