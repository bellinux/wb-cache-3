50|$|The RG-32 Scout is {{a family}} of mine-resistant 4×4 light {{armoured}} vehicles made by BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa (formerly Land Systems OMC) in South Africa. It {{is based on the}} RG-31, which is already deployed worldwide with peace-keeping, security and combat forces. The combat weight of the vehicle is about 7,300 kg and it has the capacity to carry a crew of 5 to 7. The vehicle crew is protected against 5.56×45mm NATO ball ammunition, grenades, firebombs, anti-personnel <b>mines</b> and <b>side</b> blasts. The five-seat version also offers protection against anti-tank <b>mines</b> and <b>side</b> blasts. Up to two RG-32Ms can be transported in a C-130 cargo aircraft.|$|R
50|$|This section also {{emerged from}} a coal <b>mine</b> <b>siding,</b> {{connecting}} the Carl colliery in Essen-Altenessen with Caternberg BME station. The line from there to Oberhausen BME station (now Oberhausen Central Station, then still the terminus of its Witten/Dortmund-Oberhausen/Duisburg line) was dismantled by the BME on 23 May 1879. It started {{at the location of}} platform tracks 1-3, which no longer exist, and went along the route now used by the Oberhausen combined tram/bus line, running {{to the north of the}} Emscher. Here the line turned in a tight curve to the east towards Osterfeld BME station, which was located in the area of the modern Märkischen Straße.|$|R

40|$|The paper compares, and {{eventually}} combines, the approaches of Harold Hotelling and David Ricardo {{to the theory}} of exhaustible resources. It is argued that Hotelling and Ricardo had in mind worlds that differ in important respects. According to Ricardo the exploitation of deposits of resources is typically subject to capacity constraints which necessitate the working of differently fertile <b>mines</b> <b>side</b> by side and which imply that the classical theory of differential rent applies. Hotelling on the other hand assumed that the amount of the resource that can be extracted in a given period of time is only constrained by the amount of it left over from the preceding period; his emphasis was therefore on royalties and not differential rent. A model is then elaborated which brings together the insights of both authors and allows one to trace relative prices and income distribution over time. ...|$|R
