50|$|Acute severe aortic {{regurgitation}} {{is associated}} with a three phase murmur, specifically a <b>midsystolic</b> <b>murmur</b> followed by S2, followed by a parasternal early diastolic and mid-diastolic murmur (Austin Flint murmur). Although the exact cause of an Austin Flint murmur is unknown, it is hypothesized that the mechanism of murmur is from the severe aortic regurgitation jet vibrating the anterior mitral valve leaflet, colliding with the mitral inflow during diastole, with increased mitral inflow velocity from the narrowed mitral valve orifice leading to the jet impinging on the myocardial wall.|$|E
5000|$|Mid-systolic {{ejection}} murmurs are due {{to blood}} flow through the semilunar valves. They occur {{at the start of}} blood ejection — which starts after S1 — and ends with the cessation of the blood flow — which is before S2. Therefore, the onset of a <b>midsystolic</b> ejection <b>murmur</b> is separated from S1 by the isovolumic contraction phase; the cessation of the murmur and the S2 interval is the aortic or pulmonary hangout time. The resultant configuration of this murmur is a crescendo-decrescendo <b>murmur.</b> Causes of <b>midsystolic</b> ejection <b>murmurs</b> include outflow obstruction, increased flow through normal semilunar valves, dilation of aortic root or pulmonary trunk, or structural changes in the semilunar valves without obstruction.|$|R
40|$|A 14 -year-old 18 -kg (39. 6 -lb) sexually intact male German Shorthaired Pointer was {{evaluated}} because of severe weakness and inability {{to maintain a}} standing position. The owner had found the dog outdoors in lateral recumbency, after it had been outside for several hours during the winter season. It had been recently determined that the dog had vestibular syndrome. On physical examination, the dog was in lateral recumbency and had dull mentation. The dogâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s rectal temperature was 33. 8 Â°C (92. 84 Â°F); oral mucous membranes were pale pink, and capillary refill time was 2 seconds. The femoral pulses were weak and irregular, and the heart rate was variable (120 to 200 beats/min). A grade 2 / 6 left apical <b>midsystolic</b> heart <b>murmur</b> was auscultated. Bradypnea (10 breaths/min) with deep breaths and expiratory apneas were observed. The initial diagnostic evaluation included hematologic and serum biochemical analyses, blood gas analyses, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography, ECG, and echocardiography. The CBC revealed mild leukocytosis (18, 200 WBCs/Î¼L; reference range, 5, 000 to 17, 000 WBCs/Î¼L) with neutrophilia (15, 400 neutrophils/Î¼L; reference range, 3, 700 to 12, 000 neutrophils/Î¼L). Venous blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH, 7300 [reference range, 7360 to 7. 410]; HCO 3 -concentration, 15. 3 mEq/L [reference range, 20 to 24 mEq/L]; pCO 2, 36 mm Hg [reference range, 40 to 50 mm Hg]; base excess, - 5. 7 mmol/L [reference range, - 4 to + 4 mmol/L]) with hyperlactatemia (4. 1 mmol/L; reference range, 0. 5 to 2. 5 mmol/L). Results of serum biochemical analyses were within reference ranges. Systolic blood pressure measurement revealed systemic hypotension (70 mm Hg). No abnormalities were detected on thoracic radiographs. Echocardiography revealed a mild thickening and prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets, with mild mitral valve regurgitation and normal heart chamber dimensions. Electrocardiography was performed to evaluate the arrhythmia...|$|R
