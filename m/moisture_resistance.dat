40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to understand the <b>moisture</b> damage <b>resistance</b> of unmodified and ground tire rubber (GTR) modified asphalt binders containing three different type of warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives using the surface free energy (SFE) approach. The SFE parameters of unmodified and GTR-modified asphalt binders with and without WMA additives were determined in the laboratory using the Wilhelmy plate method. The SFE of two types of aggregate, namely, granite and limestone, were adopted from literature. Thereafter, work of adhesion, work of cohesion, work of debonding, and energy ratio (ER) were estimated {{for a total of}} 16 different combinations of aggregate and asphalt binder. An attempt was made to evaluate sensitivity of SFE parameters with elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur) of asphalt binder. The results showed that <b>moisture</b> damage <b>resistance</b> of unmodified and GTR-modified asphalt binder decreases with addition of WMA additives. The control asphalt binder with Rediset (Akzo Nobel, Netherlands) showed better bond with aggregate, followed by Sasobit (SasolWax, Hamburg, Germany) and Advera (PQ Corporation, Malvern, Pennsylvania).

40|$|The surface {{heat and}} {{moisture}} transfer {{from the human}} body are normally characterized by the thermal insulation and <b>moisture</b> vapor <b>resistance,</b> which are important parameters in environmental engineering. In the past, due to the limitation of measurement technology, simultaneous measurement of these two parameters was not possible and hence {{there is a lack}} of clear understanding on the interaction of surface heat and moisture transfer. In this paper, through the experimental measurements on a newly developed sweating/non-sweating fabric manikin (named WALTER) under varying climatic conditions and "walking" speeds, we show that the surface thermal insulation is little affected by moisture transfer. The surface <b>moisture</b> vapor <b>resistances</b> measured under isothermal conditions tend to be greater than those measured under non-isothermal conditions, especially when the wind velocity is less than 2. 0 m/s.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effect}} of added fullness and ventilation holes in T-shirt design on clothing comfort measured in terms of thermal insulation and <b>moisture</b> vapour <b>resistance.</b> Four T-shirts in four different sizes (S, M, L, XL) were cut under the traditional sizing method while another (F- 1) was cut with specially added fullness to create a 'flared' drape. A thermal manikin 'Walter' was used to measure the thermal insulation and <b>moisture</b> vapour <b>resistance</b> of the T-shirts in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. The tests included four conditions: manikin standing still in the no-wind and windy conditions and walking in the no-wind and windy condition. It was found that adding fullness in the T-shirt design (F- 1) to create the 'flared' drape can significantly reduce the T-shirt's thermal insulation and <b>moisture</b> vapour <b>resistance</b> under walking or windy conditions. Heat and moisture transmission through the T-shirt can be further enhanced by creating small apertures on the front and back of the T-shirt with specially added fullness. Statement of Relevance: The thermal comfort of the human body {{is one of the key}} issues in the study of ergonomics. When doing exercise, a human body will generate heat, which will eventually result in sweating. If heat and moisture are not released effectively from the body, heat stress may occur and the person's performance will be negatively affected. Therefore, contemporary athletic T-shirts are designed to improve the heat and moisture transfer from the wearer. Through special cutting, such athletic T-shirts can be designed to improve the ventilation of the wearer. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} on an {{experimental}} investigation of the thermal insulation and <b>moisture</b> vapor <b>resistance</b> of a thermal insulation assembly consisting of polyester battings and metal-coated thin nonwoven interlayers. Because of the blocking of radiation by the coated metal nanoparticles, the thermal radiative conductivity of the interlayer decreased from 0. 0249 to 0. 0194 W/m K after coating. We found that the thermal insulation of the fibrous assembly could be greatly improved without any {{significant effect on the}} moisture transfer through the incorporation of metal-coated interlayers between the fibrous battings in appropriate patterns. The thermal resistance of the assembly increased gradually with increasing number of incorporated interlayers until it reached a plateau. The presence of more metal-coated interlayers closer to the hot (heat-source) side was beneficial to higher thermal insulation. The <b>moisture</b> vapor <b>resistance</b> of the assembly showed no significant changes with increasing number of interlayers. The incorporation of three interlayers showed the best thermal insulation properties with little effect on the moisture transmission.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} dimensionless {{groups for}} coupled heat and moisture transfer in a cross flow air-to-air enthalpy exchanger with hydrophilic membrane cores are derived and validated with experimental data. The thermal and moisture transfer mechanisms in membranes are studied. The finite difference numerical solutions {{of the model}} are used to study heat and moisture transfer in enthalpy exchangers. The variations of sensible, latent, and enthalpy effectiveness with various operating parameters are calculated for different types of material. Studies show that the sensible effectiveness is mainly determined by number of transfer units (NTU) of the exchanger, while the latent effectiveness is influenced by both the material and the operating conditions. Unlike thermal diffusive <b>resistance,</b> the <b>moisture</b> diffusive <b>resistance</b> in membrane is not a constant. It is co-determined by the slopes of sorption curves and the operating conditions. To account for these influences, a new dimensionless factor named the coefficient of <b>moisture</b> diffusive <b>resistance</b> (CMDR) is defined.

By comparing the performances with different membrane materials, it is revealed that the membrane material with a linear sorption curve performs better than other materials under common conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Thermal {{remote sensing}} of soil {{moisture}} in vineyards is a challenge. The grass-covered soil, {{in addition to}} a standing grape canopy, create complex patterns of heating and cooling and increase the surface temperature variability between vine rows. In this study, we evaluate the strength of relationships between soil <b>moisture,</b> mechanical <b>resistance</b> and thermal inertia calculated from the drop of surface temperature during a clear sky night over a vineyard in the Niagara region. We utilized data from two sensors, an airborne thermal camera (height ≈ 500 m a. g. l.) and a handheld thermal gun (height ≈ 1 m a. g. l.), to explore the effects of different field of views and the high inter-row temperature variability. Spatial patterns of soil moisture correlated more with estimated thermal inertia than with surface temperature recorded at sunrise or sunset. Despite the coarse resolution of airborne thermal inertia images, it performed better than estimates from the handheld thermal gun. Between-row variation was further analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Despite the limited spatial variability of soil properties within a single vineyard, the magnitudes of the model coefficients for soil <b>moisture</b> and mechanical <b>resistance</b> ar...|$|R
