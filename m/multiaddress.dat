40|$|A low-latency path setup {{approach}} with multiple setup packets for parallel set is presented. It reduces the header overhead compared to <b>multiaddress</b> encoding. Further, we propose four variants of deadlock-free multicast routing algorithms using different subpath generation methods, different destination partitioning, and channel sharing strategies.

The procedure for increment of the <b>multiaddress</b> cable cores have been developed, the sequence of the actions (algorithm) permitting to obtain the minimum of the purpose function has been found. The created algorithms are applicable both for computer-aided and for traditional design procedures. The economy of the matrial in connection with application of the algorithms achieves 24 %.

40|$|Bloom filter is effective, space-efficient data {{structure}} for concisely representing a data set and supporting approximate membership queries. Traditionally, researchers often {{believe that it}} is possible that a Bloom filter returns a false positive, but it will never return a false negative under well-behaved operations. By investigating the mainstream variants, however, we observe that a Bloom filter does return false negatives in many scenarios. In this work, we show that the undetectable incorrect deletion of false positive items and detectable incorrect deletion of <b>multiaddress</b> items are two general causes of false negative in a Bloom filter. We then measure the potential and exposed false negatives theoretically and practically. Inspired {{by the fact that the}} potential false negatives are usually not fully exposed, we propose a novel Bloom filter scheme, which increases the ratio of bits set to a value larger than one without decreasing the ratio of bits set to zero. Mathematical analysis and comprehensive experiments show that this design can reduce the number of exposed false negatives as well as decrease the likelihood of false positives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dealing with both the false positive and false negative problems of Bloom filter systematically when supporting standard usages of item insertion, query, and deletion operations...|$|E
40|$|Mobility and {{multihoming}} (or <b>multiaddressing)</b> {{are becoming}} more and more common in the Internet. Still one of the most problematic issues is the relation between locations and identities of mobile hosts. Currently the IP address is used to represent both; end-point in the transport layer connections and location for routing in the network level. This paper discusses the need for separating the concepts of location and identity and evaluates proposed solutions for that. The proposals define an intermediate host identity sublayer between the existing network and transport layers, for separating identifiers and locators and for providing mapping between them.

40|$|Abstract The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is an Internet {{security}} and <b>multiaddressing</b> mechanism {{specified by the}} IETF. HIP introduces a new layer between the transport and network layers of the TCP/IP stack that maps host identifiers to network locations, thus separating the two conflicting roles that IP addresses have in the current Internet. This paper analyzes the {{security and}} functionality of the HIP base exchange, which is a classic key exchange protocol with some novel features for authentication and DoS protection. The base exchange is the most stable part of the HIP specification with multiple existing implementations. We point out several security issues in the current protocol and propose changes that are compatible {{with the goals of}} HIP. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comprehensive}} set of mechanisms that restore to the site administrator the capacity of enforcing Traffic Engineering (TE) policies in a <b>multiaddressed</b> IPv 6 scenario. The mechanisms rely {{on the ability of}} SHIM 6 to securely perform locator changes in a transparent fashion to transport and application layers. Once an outgoing path has been selected for a communication by proper routing configuration in the site, the source prefix of SHIM 6 data packets is rewritten by the site routers to avoid packet discarding due to ingress filtering. The SHIM 6 locator preferences exchanged in the context establishment phase are modified by the site routers to influence in the path used for receiving traffic. Scalable deployment is ensured b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new {{addressing}} and routing design {{called the}} Less-Is-More Architecture (LIMA) is proposed as an inter-domain solution {{for a future}} Internet. Unlike recently proposed identifierlocator split solutions, LIMA uses just (topological) locationindependent names and location-dependent addresses. The feasibility of using a policy combination of restricting stubs to provider-aggregatable addressing only, and disallowing stub-level reachability from being propagated into the global routing tables, is studied. This policy combination results in significantly smaller global routing tables but creates four challenges of address renumbering (when stubs change providers), multihoming, mobility, and traffic engineering. Solutions to these challenges {{include the use of}} <b>multiaddressing,</b> name based sockets, a LIMA concept of address dismemberment, transport protocols such as SCTP that are capable of dynamic address reconfiguration, and new management-plane and control-plane procedures. Preliminary RIB data analysis quantify the benefit of LIMA in global routing table size reduction (to 6815 entries from today’s 335 K entries), and a cost of LIMA in terms of number of provider changes made by stubs {{in the last six months}} (about 2450 provider changes per month across 33 K stubs).
