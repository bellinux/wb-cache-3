5|$|The violent {{removal of}} the Hébertists and Dantonists {{provided}} only a mirage of stability. Their deaths caused deep resentment in the Convention, and their absence only <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Jacobins to influence the dangerously unpredictable masses of sans-culottes. The elimination of the popular demagogues and the consequent loss of support in the streets would prove disastrous for Saint-Just and Robespierre during the events of Thermidor.|$|E
5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined {{the boundaries of the}} region's tribes.|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking {{behind one of the}} goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E

5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, {{it was close to}} zero.|$|E
5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E

50|$|In some ways, the 1799 Constitution was a regression. The {{progressive}} idea {{of voting}} by ballot in the General Assembly was removed.

5|$|While recent discoveries have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to present}} a universally {{agreed-upon}} list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating {{in the most recent}} common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the synapomorphies of such a group.|$|E
5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E
50|$|I deplore {{the tragic}} events of last August {{not only because}} they {{revealed}} human nature in its lowest aspects, but also because they have estranged the two peoples and have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> temporarily <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to approach one another.

50|$|Constant {{winds and}} cold winters <b>made</b> <b>it</b> much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than {{expected}} {{to establish a}} working farm, and the struggle led to bankruptcy of the senior Graves' once-thriving paint and wallpaper store in Seattle.

50|$|Polygamous marriages may {{be legally}} {{contracted}} in Algeria {{in the form}} of polygyny, and a man may take up to four wives.

5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not {{released}} outside Japan: no explanation {{was given by}} Nintendo, although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its exclusivity to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release: an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringers text-heavy approach <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> and thus less appealing to localize. To date, it remains exclusive to Japan. An unofficial open fan translation patch was created: while not complete, it translated the greater majority of text into English.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
50|$|This contrasted {{strongly}} with Pershing II, {{which had a}} flight time of 10-15 minutes. However, {{the range of the}} GLCM gave it the ability to strike deep within then-Soviet territory, and the missile guidance, and low radar cross-section would have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to intercept a GLCM even if the launch were detected in time.|$|R
50|$|The purpose-based {{standard}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for plaintiffs {{to prevail}} in discrimination suits arising under the Constitution.

5|$|The next British {{airborne}} unit to {{land was}} the 5th Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Nigel Poett. The brigade was designated {{to land on}} drop zoneB and achieved this, although not as accurately as 3rd Parachute Brigade due to poor visibility around the drop zone, which also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for paratroopers of the brigade to rally. The drop zone {{came under heavy fire}} from German troops stationed nearby, and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Parachute Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th Parachute Battalion and 13th Parachute Battalion rapidly secured the rest of the brigade's objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schnappenberg, as well as to engage German forces gathered {{to the west of the}} farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30 Brigadier Poett reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked up with other British airborne units.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} against the Third Romanian Army began at 08:50, {{led by the}} 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the 5th Tank Army. The first two assaults were repulsed by the Romanian defenders, {{and the effects of}} the heavy artillery bombardment had actually <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for Soviet armor to navigate through the minefields and terrain. However, the lack of heavy anti-tank artillery caused the Romanian defense to collapse; a breakthrough by the 4th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps was established by noon. Soon after, the 5th Tank Army was able to gain a breakthrough against the Second Romanian Corps, followed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet armor navigated through the thick fog by compass, overrunning Romanian and German artillery positions, three Romanian infantry divisions began to fall back in disarray; the Third Romanian Army had been outflanked to the West and East. After receiving the news of the Soviet attack, Sixth Army headquarters failed to order the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions, hitherto engaged in Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to bolster the Romanian defenses; instead the task was given to the seriously understrength and poorly equipped 48th Panzer Corps.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|When pseudoneurotic {{schizophrenia}} {{was still}} being utilized as a diagnostic term, doctors {{were expected to be}} able to magically cure patients.

5|$|The local Polish {{population}} {{felt that}} Warsaw had betrayed {{them and they}} were not satisfied with the division of Cieszyn Silesia. About 12,000 to 14,000 Poles were forced to leave to Poland. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates (depending mainly whether the Silesians are included as Poles or not) range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles filled in Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities but reality in Zaolzie was quite different. Local Czech authorities <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. Czechs schools were built in ethnically almost entirely Polish municipalities. This and other factors contributed to the cultural assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After few years, the heightened nationalism typical for the years around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not follow certain laws related to language, legislative and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put those issues on agenda. One way or the other, more and more local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E
5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim.
