At present, many <b>mixing</b> <b>indices</b> have been proposed to measure the evolution of the homogeneity of mixture. This paper presents observation the analysis of variance six of these <b>mixing</b> <b>indices.</b> The study is based on the comparison of experimental data obtained on mixing a binary polymer mixtures using bubbling fluidised bed. Experimental results are discussed and compared with values obtained for various gas velocity and bed depth. However, variance <b>mixing</b> <b>indices</b> proposed in the literature give different results for the determination of <b>mixing</b> <b>indices.</b> The results obtained show that gas velocity and bed depth are important parameters influencing solid mixing in a bubbling fluidised bed. Whilst it was obtained the Lacey <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> is the best efficient compared with others. Index Terms—Particle mixing; Fluidisation; Mixing indices; Mixture homogeneity...|$|R

The solid materials were sand (size 0. 7 mm), sugar (size 0. 7 mm) and 15 % cast iron used as a tracer. The fluidizing gas was air with velocity ranged from 0. 45 - 0. 65 m/s while the mixing time was up to 10 minutes. The <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> for each experiment was calculated by averaging the results of 10 samples taken from different radial and axial positions in fluidized QVF column 150 mm ID and 900 mm height. The experimental results were used in solving a mathematical model of mixing rate and <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> at an equilibrium proposed by Rose. The results show that <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> increases with increasing air velocity and mixing time until it reaches an optimum value then decrease to an equilibrium value. The results also show the dependency of the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> on the particle size of the tracer component. The statistical analysis of the obtained theoretical <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> versus the experimental <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> shows that the standard error is 0. 92 % (about 1 %) with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9857 and the total residual of 0. 002 for the ninth observation of the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> (theoretical versus experimental) over 95 % confidence level. <br /...|$|R
30|$|This work {{presents}} a parametric investigation on flow structure and mixing in a micromixer with two-layer crossing channels which {{was reported by}} Xia et al. (2005). The flow and mixing performance were numerically analyzed using ANSYS-CFX inbuilt diffusion–convection model. Present numerical results for mixing agree quantitatively and qualitatively well with the previous numerical results. The <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> along with pressure-drop have been examined in terms of two geometric parameters related to sub-channel width and depth, i.e., Wc/H and D/H, respectively, at various Reynolds numbers in a range from 0.2 to 40. The <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> at the exit of the micromixer increases {{with the increase in}} D/H, and becomes more sensitive to D/H as Reynolds number decreases. At Re =  40, the effect of D/H on the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> is almost negligible, while at Re =  0.2 with the increase in D/H from 0.18 to 0.37, the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> at the exit of the micromixer increases from 0.89 to 0.99, which is quite good achievement in mixing at this low Reynolds number. A quantitative comparison among the <b>mixing</b> <b>indexes</b> at low Reynolds numbers in various micromixers indicates that the present micromixer produces the extraordinarily high <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> at Re =  0.2 compared to the previous micromixers. Velocity vectors at Re =  0.2 show that increase in D/H strengthens the ‘‘saddle-shaped’’ flow pattern. The <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> at the exit of the micromixer generally decreases with increase in Wc/H, and the decreasing rate of the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> with Wc/H becomes larger as D/H and Reynolds number decrease. At Re =  0.2, the maximum relative reductions in pressure drop are about 70 and 75  %, respectively, with the increase in Wc/H and D/H in their tested ranges. This study is expected to provide preliminary input for the design of an optimum micromixer.|$|R

In this study, the effect of placing the obstructions parallel and perpendicular to the N 2 and H 2 flow was observed initially. Parallel placement resulted in favorable conditions in maintaining the desired ratio of the two components giving more than 90 % <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> throughout the channel length while perpendicular placement signaled better lateral movement on encountering the obstruction. Taking a cue from this, geometries having a combination of parallel and perpendicular obstructions were proposed based on results of parametric study on number of wires and spacing between them. Increasing perpendicular obstruction sets beyond 5 took the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> down to as low as 60 %. Increasing spacing from 1. 5 mm to 2 mm deteriorated <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> further but reducing perpendicular sets from 5 to 3 with 2 mm spacing resulted in 90 % <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> throughout the channel and benchmark observed in axial-only configuration was regained.

The mixing process, quality, velocity and kinetic energy are analyzed by the <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> and entropy. A cluster-like upcasting motion is found especially for square particles at the rapidest rotation. The <b>mixing</b> <b>index</b> and entropy show consistent variations of mixing degree. Two mechanisms can affect the mixing entropy, through either the static covering related to shapes or the concentration reduction in rolling/cascading/cataracting process related to the rolling capability.
