40|$|Although the {{application}} of multigrid methods to the equations of elasticity has been suggested, few such applications {{have been reported in}} the literature. In the present work, multigrid techniques are applied to the finite element analysis of a simply supported Bernoulli-Euler beam, and various aspects of the multigrid algorithm are studied and explained in detail. In this study, six grid levels were used to model half the beam. With linear prolongation and sequential ordering, the multigrid algorithm yielded results which were of <b>machine</b> <b>accuracy</b> with work equivalent to 200 standard Gauss-Seidel iterations on the fine grid. Also with linear prolongation and sequential ordering, the V(1,n) cycle with n greater than 2 yielded better convergence rates than the V(n, 1) cycle. The restriction and prolongation operators were derived based on energy principles. Conserving energy during the inter-grid transfers required that the prolongation operator be the transpose of the restriction operator, and led to improved convergence rates. With energy-conserving prolongation and sequential ordering, the multigrid algorithm yielded results of <b>machine</b> <b>accuracy</b> with a work equivalent to 45 Gauss-Seidel iterations on the fine grid.

Meanwhile, the oil film heat transfer causes thermal disturbance to the <b>machine</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to study the mechanism of the oil film heat transfer and the heat-transfer-reducing method to improve the <b>machine</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This paper describes a comprehensive thermal finite element (FE) simulation modeling method for the hydrostatic machine feed platform to study methods of reducing machine thermal errors. First of all, the generating heat power of viscous hydraulic oil flowing between parallel planes is calculated based on the Bernoulli equation. This calculation is then employed for the simulation load calculations for the closed hydrostatic guideways, which is adopted by the hydrostatic machine feed platform. Especially, in these load calculations, the changing of oil film thickness (resulted from external loads) and the changing of oil dynamic viscosity (influenced by its temperature) are taken into account. Based on these loads, thermal FE simulation modeling of the hydrostatic machine feed platform is completed to predict and analyze its thermal characteristics. The reliability of this simulation modeling method is verified by experiments. The studies demonstrate that the hydrostatic machine thermal error degree is determined by the oil film heat transfer scale, and this scale is mainly influenced by the relative oil supply temperature to ambient temperature (quantitative comparison of oil supply temperature and ambient temperature). Furthermore, the reduction of the absolute value of this relative oil supply temperature can reduce the oil film heat transfer scale and improve the <b>machine</b> <b>accuracy...</b>|$|R

Consequently the goal of current research work {{is to reduce the}} necessary metrological effort without decreasing the achievable improvement of the <b>machining</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This paper deals with an approach for systematic analyses of the axis error impact on the overall 5 -axis <b>machining</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The bases for the analyses are mathematical models that represent the transformation of the single axis errors on the overall three-dimensional <b>machining</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Within systematic analyses the impact of each single axis error can be evaluated independent of the error amount but in consideration of the axis configuration, the machine size as well as further parameters like tool and work piece size. The results show that the specific impact depends particularly on the machine size and the axis configuration. Besides this a metrological approach will be presented that capacitates the validation of the impact analyses results. This approach also gives the chance to realise a quick check calibration procedure by exploiting the developed mathematical models and the information about inferior and superior errors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Machining</b> <b>accuracy</b> depends very {{strongly}} on the connection {{characteristics of the}} spindle/toolholder interface. Under high rotational speed, the connection characteristics vary greatly.

Advanced nonlinear FEM technology can provide an effective approach to solve this problem. The results demonstrate that higher drawbar force can increase contact pressure between the toolholder and the spindle to prevent the tool from bending during cutting process, and reasonable initial interference can effectively improve axial positioning accuracy of the tool relatively to the spindle. So, enhancing the drawbar force and choosing a reasonable initial interference is benefit to improving <b>machining</b> <b>accuracy</b> and surface quality...|$|E
