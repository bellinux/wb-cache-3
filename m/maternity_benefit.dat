25|$|Lynch's {{first term}} as Taoiseach also {{witnessed}} various reforms {{in areas such}} as welfare and education. In 1967, a redundancy payments scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate <b>maternity</b> <b>benefit.</b> In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three miles from the nearest school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the murder}} of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted over {{the floor of the}} entire cellar. He would later convert this section of the {{household}} into a bedroom for his oldest children, and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred—either with or without Rose's participation but certainly with her knowledge—murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had taken lodgings with the Wests in April 1977, and was heavily pregnant with a baby son {{at the time of her}} murder. Although Rose—herself pregnant at the time—is known to have initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband's, she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal of a threat to the stability of the Wests' relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street, and although extensively dismembered, no restraining devices were found with Robinson's remains, thus making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for <b>maternity</b> <b>benefit</b> in Shirley's name with Gloucester social services. As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who enquired as to Robinson's whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in West Germany.|$|E

He does so, but is unaware Kat is inside. She becomes trapped although Alfie rescues her. She is badly burnt and suffers permanent scarring to her face. On leaving hospital, she and Alfie remarry with two nurses as the only witnesses, before returning to the square and moving into a flat Alfie has organised for them to squat in. When the owners arrive, they are thrown out and Kat is angry with Alfie, although out of desperation they squat in a new flat with help from Donna. Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hanchard) calls the landlord of the flat when trying to fix the boiler, so they are evicted again and they stay at the Vic with Alfie's friend Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). After Kat makes an emotional speech to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull. Stacey tries to stop her but before they leave Kat discovers a photo of Nana that was not lost in the house. Alfie confesses that it was he who started the fire. Kat, appalled by the disclosure, insists their marriage is over and stays with Stacey and Lily.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} number of young women veterans are returning from war and military service and are seeking reproductive health care from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Many of these women seek <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> from the VHA, and yet little is known regarding {{the number of women}} veterans utilizing VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> nor the characteristics of pregnant veterans using these benefits. In May 2010, VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> were expanded to include 7 days of infant care, which may serve to entice more women to use VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits.</b> Understanding the changing trends in women veterans seeking <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> will help the VHA {{to improve the quality of}} reproductive care over time. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the trends in delivery claims among women veterans receiving VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> over a 5 -year period and the characteristics of pregnant veterans utilizing VHA benefits. DESIGN: We undertook a retrospective, national cohort study of pregnant veterans enrolled in VHA care with inpatient deliveries between fiscal years (FY) 2008 and 2012. PARTICIPANTS: We included pregnant veterans using VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> for delivery. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included annualized numbers and rates of inpatient deliveries and delivery-related costs, as well as cesarean section rates as a quality indicator. KEY RESULTS: During the 5 -year study period, there was a significant increase in the number of deliveries to women veterans using VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits.</b> The overall delivery rate increased by 44 % over the study period from 12. 4 to 17. 8 deliveries per 1, 000 women veterans. A majority of women using VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> were age 30 or older and had a service-connected disability. From FY 2008 to 2012, the VHA paid more than $ 46 million in delivery claims to community providers for deliveries to women veterans ($ 4, 993 /veteran). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 5 -year period, the volume of women veterans using VHA <b>maternity</b> <b>benefits</b> increased by 44 %. Given this sizeable increase, the VHA must increase its capacity to care for pregnant veterans and ensure care coordination systems are in place to address the needs of pregnant veterans with service-connected disabilities...|$|R

2500|$|One {{important}} {{legacy of}} Curtin's was the significant expansion {{of social services}} under his leadership. In 1942, uniform taxation was imposed on the various states, which enabled the Curtin Government {{to set up a}} far-reaching, federally administered range of social services. These included a widows' pension (1942), maternity benefits for Indigenous Australians (1942), funeral benefits (1943), a second form of <b>maternity</b> <b>benefit</b> (1943), a wife's allowance (1943), additional allowances for the children of pensioners (1943), unemployment, sickness and Special Benefits (1945), and pharmaceutical benefits (1945). Substantial improvements to pensions were made, with invalidity and old-age pensions increased, the qualifying period of residence for age pensions halved, and the means test liberalised. Other social security benefits were significantly increased, while child endowment was liberalised, a scheme of vocational training for invalid pensioners was set up, and pensions extended to cover Aborigines. The expansion of social security under John Curtin was of such significance that, as summed up by one historian, ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Part 1 of the National Insurance Act 1911, {{compulsory}} {{health insurance}} was provided for workers earning less than £160 per year. The scheme was contributed to by the worker who contributed fourpence, the employer who contributed threepence and the government who contributed twopence. The scheme provided sickness benefit entitlement of nine shillings (£36), free medical treatment and <b>maternity</b> <b>benefit</b> of 30 shillings (£120). An estimated 13million workers came to be compulsorily covered under this scheme. Part 2 of the National Insurance Act passed in 1911 gave workers the right to sick pay of 9s a week and free medical treatment {{in return for a}} payment for 4d a week. Sick pay would be paid for 26 weeks of sickness. The medical treatment was provided by doctors who belonged to a [...] "panel" [...] in each district. Doctors received a fee from the insurance fund for each [...] "panel" [...] patient they treated. The National Insurance Act (Part II) gave workers the right to unemployment pay of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2½d a week. Under Part 2 of the National Insurance Act 1911, which dealt with unemployment insurance, most insured workers were given seven shillings in unemployment benefit which could be claimed for up to 15 weeks a year. This scheme was also financed through the contributions of workers and government. Although only a minority of workers were insured by this scheme, it nevertheless covered a number of trades and industries, such as shipbuilding, which were particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in employment.|$|E

Payments are made {{on the condition that}} at least three antenatal visits are made, the first being {{before the end of the}} first trimester. DESIGN [...] The study involved a random sample of women who were interviewed after delivery during their stay in hospital. Data on pregnancy outcome were collected from medical records. SETTING [...] The study was carried out in four public maternity units in different regions of France. PARTICIPANTS [...] 1692 women were included in the analysis (86. 8 % of the selected sample).

However, in states where the Employees’ State Insurance Act applies, employers no longer have any liability under the <b>Maternity</b> <b>Benefit</b> Act. Under this Act, a pregnant woman worker is entitled to 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, and six weeks in case of miscarriage or termination of pregnancy. Pregnant women also have the right to not perform physically arduous work, which may affect their pregnancy, and no deductions can be made from their wages because of this.
