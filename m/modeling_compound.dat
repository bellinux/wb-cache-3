40|$|This study {{examined}} the ligninase-catalysed degradation of lignin <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> representing the arylglycerol beta-aryl ether substructure, which is the dominant one in the lignin polymer. Three dimeric <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> were used, all methoxylated in the 3 - and 4 -positions of the arylglycerol ring (ring A) and having various substituents in the beta-ether-linked aromatic ring (ring B), so that competing reactions involving both rings could be compared. Studies of the products formed and the time courses of their formation showed that these <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> are oxidized by ligninase (+ H 2 O 2 + O 2) in both ring A and ring B. The major consequence with all three <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> is oxidation of ring A, leading primarily to cleavage between C(alpha) and C(beta) (C(alpha) being proximal to ring A), {{and to a lesser}} extent to the oxidation of the C(alpha) -hydroxy group to a carbonyl group. Such C(alpha) -oxidation deactivates ring A, leaving only ring B for attack. Studies with C(alpha) -carbonyl <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> corresponding to the three basic <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> revealed that oxidation of ring B leads in part to dealkoxylations (i. e. to cleavage of the glycerol beta-aryl ether bond and to demethoxylations), but that these are minor reactions in the <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> most closely related to lignin. Evidence is also given that another consequence of oxidation of ring B in the C(alpha) -carbonyl <b>model</b> <b>compounds</b> is formation of unstable cyclohexadienone ketals, which can decompose with elimination of the beta-ether-linked aromatic ring. The mechanisms proposed for the observed reactions involve initial formation of aryl cation radicals in either ring A or ring B.
