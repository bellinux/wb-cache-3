25|$|Surprise {{is not yet}} to {{be broken}} up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey {{on a mission to}} protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the USS Norfolk, sailing on HMS Surprise on his first voyage around Cape Horn. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He {{recruits}} Mr Allen, a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on <b>Mr</b> <b>Martin</b> as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a Jonah with Hollom.|$|E
25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to {{the men and women who}} were just passing through. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Martin</b> was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E

25|$|After {{surviving}} {{the tail of}} a typhoon, the Surprise finds the Norfolk wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, <b>Mr</b> <b>Martin</b> and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the Norfolk, Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the Surprise away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the Norfolks were mutineers in 1797 aboard HMS Hermione; they will be hanged by the British. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are prisoners of war. Both groups are eager to leave this island. Aubrey orders his carpenters to lengthen the launch so they can sail away, pushing the rest to collect food. He sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the Norfolk spot the same whaler, cheer at the sight, and then kill their informer. The Norfolks fight with the Surprises. Their cheering stops when the whaler loses two masts and strikes her colours, because it is the Surprise that takes her in chase.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the days}} of O'Connell a larger public {{demonstration}} has not been witnessed than that of Sunday last. About 1 o'clock the monster procession started from Claremorris, headed by several thousand men on foot – the men of each district wearing a laural leaf or green ribbon in hat or coat to distinguish the several contingents. At 11 o'clock a monster contingent of tenant-farmers on horseback drew {{up in front of}} Hughes's hotel, showing discipline and order that a cavalry regiment might feel proud of. They were led on in sections, each having a marshal who kept his troops well in hand. Messrs. P.W. Nally, J.W. Nally, H. French, and M. Griffin, wearing green and gold sashes, led on their different sections, who rode two deep, occupying, at least, over an Irish mile of the road. Next followed a train of carriages, brakes, cares, etc. led on by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Martin</b> Hughes, the spirited hotel proprietor, driving a pair of rare black ponies to a phæton, taking Messrs. J.J. Louden and J. Daly. Next came Messrs. O'Connor Power, J. Ferguson, and Thomas Brennan in a covered carriage, followed by at least 500 vehicles from the neighbouring towns. On passing through Ballindine the sight was truly imposing, the endless train directing its course to Irishtown – a neat little hamlet on the boundaries of Mayo, Roscommon, and Galway.|$|E
500|$|After a short break, {{the group}} {{gathered}} again in Ecclestone's office to find Renault team principal Flavio Briatore {{on the phone}} with Max Mosley. Mosley had apparently rejected all of their proposals, and it was stated that [...] "Mosley had informed <b>Mr</b> <b>Martin,</b> the FIA's most senior representative in the USA, that if any kind of non-championship race was run, or any alteration made to the circuit, the US Grand Prix, and indeed, all FIA-regulated motorsport in the US, would be under threat". On the same day that Stoddart's version of events was published, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had made the reported threat, or that any such conversation had taken place.|$|E

500|$|Martin, his wife, Hilda, and Clarence Malvo {{were under}} federal {{indictment}} for conspiracy {{to engage in}} illegal gambling and could have faced {{up to five years}} in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Martin</b> had also been charged with seven additional counts: having an illegal gambling business, conspiracy to launder money, three counts of laundering money and two counts of using money from illegal activities. The charge against Hilda Martin was dropped as part of a plea agreement. On April 8, 2002, Malvo pleaded guilty to grand jury perjury for testifying that he did not work for Martin. [...] On May 28, 2002 Martin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money. He agreed to cooperate with investigations by the government, Michigan and the NCAA. The other seven charges against Martin were dropped in addition to those against Hilda. Furthermore, Martin was barred from associating with the team by a ban, which made any continuing financial relationship with him in violation of NCAA rules and to be considered a new violation.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. hide contributed several songs, including the single [...] "Scars", while Pata's only claim is [...] "White Wind from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Martin</b> ~Pata's Nap~". Toshi's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music {{to a couple of}} songs, notably [...] "Voiceless Screaming" [...] from the album Jealousy, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and Desperate Angel. Heath's only writing credit is the instrumental song [...] "Wriggle" [...] on the 1996 album Dahlia, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, [...] "Easy Fight Rambling" [...] on the 1989 album Blue Blood. Of songs from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track [...] "Time Trip Loving" [...] from the single [...] "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since. That year, Yoshiki claimed that their new material was [...] "pretty much the same thing, maybe a little edgier." [...] However, in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before, adding that it will be very heavy, melodic, and [...] "more contemporary." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} the North-West University Botanical Garden dates back to 1962 when dr. Wynand Louw, a botany lecturer, {{requested}} land from the then Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education {{for the establishment of}} a garden to grow plant material needed for formal practical laboratory sessions in botany. The garden was referred to as the Veld Garden during this initial period. The impetus to develop a proper botanical garden did however not start until 1971 with the arrival of prof. Daan Botha, a plant systematics lecturer. Curation of the Garden started in 1973 when mr. Bert Ubbink was appointed as curator. He was responsible for the initial design of the garden and also oversaw the layout of pathways, the construction of the office building, ponds as well as the rocky ridge and waterfall. The plant collections of the Botanical Garden also quickly expanded and two greenhouses were built to house the frost tender succulents and xerophytes as well as tropical and subtropical plants. In 1982 the Botanical Garden was officially opened to the public. Past curators include mr. Bert Ubbink (1973-2003), mr. Peter Mortimer (2003-2007), <b>mr.</b> <b>Martin</b> Smit (2007-2011) and mr. Chris van Niekerk (2012- [...] ).|$|E
