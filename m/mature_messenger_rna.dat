The process includes three major steps: addition of a 5' cap, addition of a 3' poly-adenylation tail, and splicing. This process is vital for the correct translation of the genomes of eukaryotes because the initial precursor mRNA produced during transcription contains both exons (coding or important sequences involved in translation), and introns (non-coding sequences).|$|E

40|$|In eukaryotes, {{maturation}} {{of primary}} transcripts into <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> involves {{the elimination of}} parts of the gene called ‘introns’. The biological significance of introns is not yet completely understood. It has been demonstrated that introns may contain other genes, or regulatory sequences that {{may be involved in}} transcriptional control, or also being involved in alternative splicing mechanisms. However, these functions explain the role of {{only a small number of}} them, and it is very difficult to formulate any generalization. The CTP synthase gene of Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by the presence of a long first intron (approximately 7. 2 kilobases) whose role is currently unknown. In the present report we analyzed in silico the content of this intron, and found that it contains at least three interesting sub-sequences. Two of them are homologous to the CTP synthase itself and to a putative nucleotide pyrophosphatase, respectively.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, splicing is {{the editing}} of the nascent precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript into a <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA).

For those eukaryotic genes that contain introns, splicing is usually {{required in order to}} create an mRNA molecule that can be translated into protein. For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Self-splicing introns, or ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.|$|E
50|$|The genome of an {{organism}} (encoded by the genomic DNA) is the (biological) information of heredity which is passed {{from one generation}} of organism to the next.

Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus. pre-mRNA is then processed by splicing to remove introns, leaving the exons in the <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA). Additional processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail to the pre-mRNA. The mature mRNA may then be transported to the cytosol and translated by the ribosome into a protein. Other types of RNA include ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). These types are both transcribed by RNA polymerase III and are essential for protein synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{governing the}} basic subsistence of eukaryotic cells are immensely complex; {{it is therefore}} unsurprising that regulation occurs {{at a number of}} stages of protein synthesis - the regulation of translation has become a well-studied field. Human translational control is of increasing research interest as it has connotations in a range of diseases. Orthologs of many of the factors involved in human translation are shared by a range of eukaryotic organisms; some of which are used as model systems for the investigation of translation initiation and elongation, for example: sea urchin eggs upon fertilization, rodent brain and rabbit reticulocytes. Monod and Jacob {{were among the first to}} propose that [...] "the synthesis of individual proteins may be provoked or suppressed within a cell, under the influence of specific external agents, and the relative rates at which different proteins may be profoundly altered, depending upon external conditions". Almost half a century after the flurry of postulations arising from the revelation of the central dogma of molecular biology, of which the preceding supposition by Monod and Jacob is an example; contemporary researchers still have much to learn about the modulation of genetic expression. Synthesis of protein from <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in eukaryotes is divided into translation initiation, elongation, and termination of these stages; the initiation of translation is the rate limiting step. Within the process of translation initiation; the bottleneck occurs shortly before the ribosome binds to the 5’ m7GTP facilitated by a number of proteins; it is at this stage that constrictions born of stress, amino acid starvation etc. take effect.|$|E

The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are a complex and diverse family of RNA binding proteins. hnRNPs display multiple functions in the processing of heterogeneous nuclear <b>RNAs</b> into <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> hnRNP A 1 is one of the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed members of this protein family. hnRNP A 1 plays multiple roles in gene expression by regulating major steps in the processing of nascent RNA transcripts. The transcription, splicing, stability, export through nuclear pores and translation of cellular and viral transcripts are all mechanisms modulated by this protein. The diverse functions played by hnRNP A 1 are not limited to mRNA biogenesis, but extend to the processing of microRNAs, telomere maintenance and the regulation of transcription factor activity. Genomic approaches have recently uncovered the extent of hnRNP A 1 roles in the development and differentiation of living organisms.

40|$|Birnaviruses are {{unconventional}} {{members of}} the icosahedral double-stranded (dsRNA) RNA virus group. The main differential birnavirus trait {{is the lack of}} the inner icosahedral transcriptional core, a ubiquitous structure conserved in all other icosahedral dsRNA viruses, that shelters the genome from cellular dsRNA sensors and provide the enzymatic machinery to produce and extrude <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> In contrast, birnaviral particles enclose ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed by the genome segments, the dsRNA-binding VP 3 polypeptide and the virus-encoded RNA polymerase (RdRp). The presence of RNPs suggests that the birnavirus replication program might exhibit significant differences with respect to those of prototypal dsRNA viruses. However, experimental evidences supporting this hypothesis are as yet scarce. Of particular relevance for the understanding of birnavirus replication is to determine whether RNPs act as intracellular capsid-independent transcriptional units. Our study was focused to answer this question using the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), the best characterized birnavirus, as model virus. Here, we describe the intracellular assembly of functional IBDV RNPs {{in the absence of the}} virus-encoded VP 2 capsid polypeptide. Recombinant RNPs are generated upon coexpression of the IBDV VP 1 and RdRp polypeptides and transfection of purified virus dsRNA.

50|$|Analysis of <b>mature</b> {{eukaryotic}} <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules {{showed that}} they are often {{much smaller than the}} DNA sequences that encode them. The genes were shown to be discontinuous, composed of sequences that are not present in the final mature RNA (introns), located between sequences that are retained in the mature RNA (exons). Introns were shown to be removed after transcription through a process termed RNA splicing. Splicing of RNA transcripts requires a highly precise and coordinated sequence of molecular events, consisting of (a) definition of boundaries between exons and introns, (b) RNA strand cleavage at exactly those sites, and (c) covalent linking (ligation) of the RNA exons in the correct order. The discovery of discontinuous genes and RNA splicing was entirely unexpected by the community of RNA biologists, and stands {{as one of the most}} shocking findings in molecular biology research.|$|R
5000|$|Spliceosomal introns often reside {{within the}} {{sequence}} of eukaryotic protein-coding genes. Within the intron, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing. The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence. Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in pyrimidines (C and U), or polypyrimidine tract. Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation. The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC nucleic acid notation) is: G-G-cut-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ... Y-U-R-A-C (branch sequence 20-50 nucleotides upstream of acceptor site) ... Y-rich-N-C-A-G-cut-G (acceptor site). However, {{it is noted that}} the specific sequence of intronic splicing elements and the number of nucleotides between the branchpoint and the nearest 3’ acceptor site affect splice site selection. Also, point mutations in the underlying DNA or errors during transcription can activate a cryptic splice site in part of the transcript that usually is not spliced. This results in a <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> with a missing section of an exon. In this way, a point mutation, which might otherwise affect only a single amino acid, can manifest as a deletion or truncation in the final protein.|$|E
50|$|A {{splice site}} {{mutation}} is a genetic mutation that inserts, deletes or changes {{a number of}} nucleotides in the specific site at which splicing takes place during the processing of precursor messenger RNA into <b>mature</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns. The deletion of the splicing site results {{in one or more}} introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins. When a splice site mutation occurs, the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included. Introns are supposed to be removed, while the exons are expressed. The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs: within non-coding sites in a gene, directly next to the location of the exon. The mutation can be an insertion, deletion, frame shift, etc. The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences, known as splice-donor and splice-acceptor sequences, which surround each exon. Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA, or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA. These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein. An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site. Acceptor-site and donor-site relating to the splice sites signal to the splicesome where the actual cut should be made. These donor sites, or recognition sites, are essential in the processing of mRNA. The average vertebrate gene consists of multiple small exons (average size, 137 nucleotides) separated by introns that are considerably larger.|$|E

5000|$|Alternative {{splicing}} is {{a mechanism}} by which different forms of <b>mature</b> mRNAs (<b>messengers</b> <b>RNAs)</b> are generated from the same gene. It is a regulatory {{mechanism by which}} variations in the incorporation of the exons into mRNA leads {{to the production of}} more than one related protein, thus expanding possible genomic outputs. RBPs function extensively in the regulation of this process. Some binding proteins such as neuronal specific RNA-binding proteins, namely NOVA1, control the alternative splicing of a subset of hnRNA by recognizing and binding to a specific sequence in the RNA (YCAY where Y indicates pyrimidine, U or C). These proteins then recruit splicesomal proteins to this target site. SR proteins are also well known for their role in alternative splicing through the recruitment of snRNPs that form the splicesome, namely U1 snRNP and U2AF snRNP. However, RBPs are also part of the splicesome itself. The splicesome is a complex of snRNA and protein subunits and acts as the mechanical agent that removes introns and ligates the flanking exons. Other than core splicesome complex, RBPs also bind to the sites of Cis-acting RNA elements that influence exons inclusion or exclusion during splicing. These sites are referred to as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs) and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) and depending on their location of binding, RBPs work as splicing silencers or enhancers [...]|$|R
