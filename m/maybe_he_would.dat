25|$|The Undertaker {{then began}} a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as The Unholy Alliance, which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{suffered}} a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches {{in the following}} weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, {{it would have been}} as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation. To compensate for his lack of physical action, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making smart-aleck remarks and providing commentary. In September 1999, on SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. Undertaker retorted that he did not care and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be participating in anything, thus walking out of the WWF. In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. On December 14 he made his return to action, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Caomo, Puetro Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, but meanwhile also tore his pectoral muscle, making him take almost eight months out of action.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> enjoy it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
2500|$|His mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, [...] "I {{would like}} Stephen {{to be remembered}} as a young man who had a future. He was well loved, and had he been given the chance to survive <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been the one {{to bridge the gap between}} black and white because he didn't {{distinguish}} between black or white. He saw people as people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{reason is}} because {{it comes from the}} rocks. Barberry thought it best to keep on the rocks, I suppose. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get stuck in the mud with the cases if he got on soft ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aehrenthal wanted {{full control}} of Bosnia-Herzogovina through {{annexation}} even though Austria-Hungary had administered the provinces since 1878. His reasons for this lay in the possible recovery of the [...] "sick man of Europe", Turkey. The [...] "Young Turk" [...] revolution of 1908, led in part by Enver Pasha, convinced some that the Ottoman Empire {{might be on the}} rise again. Thus, Aehrenthal reasoned, it was now or <b>maybe</b> never. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> discuss this matter with Izvolsky to ensure the Russians would not interfere with the annexation plans.|$|R
50|$|H.D. Darby, a young {{undertaker}} {{who worked}} for the McClure Funeral Parlor in nearby Ruston, and Sophia Stone, a home demonstration agent also from Ruston, came to Arcadia to identify the bodies. They had been kidnapped by the Barrow gang the previous year in Ruston, on April 27, 1933, and released near Waldo, Arkansas. Parker reportedly had laughed when she asked Darby his profession and discovered he was an undertaker. She remarked that <b>maybe</b> someday <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be working on her. Darby assisted Bailey in embalming the outlaws.|$|R
2500|$|On July 1, 2010, Jackson, {{after giving}} it {{tremendous}} thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, {{announced that he}} would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season. On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was [...] "his last stand", meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> reconsider. [...] "This year, there's no maybe", said Jackson. He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002). In his final news conference that season, he noted {{that he did not have}} much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, [...] "When I leave here, I don't anticipate Lakers management will call me up and ask my advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wetherford's face darkened {{with a look}} of doubt. [...] "It is a hard {{trip for}} a city man, but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come for you--for the Government." ...|$|E
60|$|Jamesy took to drink, and I took to Jesus. I'm {{not saying}} {{anything}} against Him. He had His life, but I wanted mine. <b>Maybe</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{was afraid}} {{if he came}} towards the school <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be arrested. If he had a {{suitcase}} he couldn't have been just an ordinary tramp. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was some working man {{looking for a job}} and without the price of a night's lodging." ...|$|R
6000|$|Stephen {{continued}} to gaze {{out to sea}} with an expressionless face. Finally he said: [...] "I've been expecting {{to hear you say}} something of the sort. I don't know. If you took Paul away, he'd grow to be a cleverer man and a richer man <b>maybe,</b> but <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be any better--or happier? He's his mother's son--he loves the sea and its ways. There's nothing of his father in him except his hankering after books. But I won't choose for him--he can go if he likes--he can go if he likes." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thought God <b>would</b> just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nix on {{the rough}} stuff, Mamie," [...] pleaded the embarrassed pugilist. [...] "How was I {{to know what}} kids feed on? And <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have passed up the lobster at that and stuck to the sardines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, George," [...] asked Billie in an undertone, [...] "if we side-step the Amber Drawing-Room? I'm wild to {{get into}} that garden. There's a man working among those roses. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> show us round." ...|$|E
60|$|Her poverty! That thought {{inspired}} her {{to add another}} castle to her dream: <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give her a trifle now and then--maybe a dollar, once a month, say; any little thing like that would help, oh, ever so much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it means}} to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> split. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> did split. I didn't wait to see. I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country." ...|$|R
30|$|Even the G-O Road {{has become}} an {{illustration}} of bio-cultural sovereignty that is accepted, acknowledged, and respected. The day that my aunt took me gathering up the G-O Road a U.S. Forest Service car pulled alongside us and a man {{stepped out of the}} vehicle. We cautiously walked over to him, half expecting that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have numerous questions about what we were doing or <b>maybe</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> challenge our gathering on federal land. Instead, he smiled and said, “You all must be here to gather beargrass. If you head up the road, there is a whole mess of it. And it’s some pretty good stuff too. I was just checking it out the other day”. It was a surprise and relief to me that he had some awareness of what we were doing. It seemed to illustrate what happens when people are educated about the continuing traditional knowledge and practices of Native peoples. While he did not specifically tell me if this was an official policy of the Forest Service in our area, he did mention that he was glad to see us out gathering that day. “It’s good that somebody is going to get some use out of this stuff,” he said.|$|R
6000|$|Jephson {{appeared}} much {{surprised by}} this story. He remained thoughtful and silent. I asked him if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to hear any more, and as he offered no active opposition I went on. (<b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was asleep; that idea did not occur {{to me at the}} time.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I trust so. But if I {{could only}} have been by his side, and felt myself a comfort, and thanked him with all my heart. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have listened to me, and not have sown ill-will between Andrew and me, by giving neither what we would like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It be, surely," [...] Harry said; [...] "but what a sight o' good {{it would}} do, {{and if his}} woife {{be willing to give}} oop her time to the girls, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do as much for us." [...] There was a pause again. Several of the lads looked irresolute.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} found her yet, your honour, but I have great hopes of doing so. Larry Callaghan died four years ago, and the woman of the house she {{occupied}} said that Mrs. Rooney moved, with his widow and children, to some {{other part of the}} town. She knew little about them, seeing that she only went into the house after they had left; but her husband worked in the same yard as Larry did, and she thought that {{he would be able to}} find out, from some of the old hands, where the widow Callaghan had moved to. She said she would ask her husband when he came home to his dinner, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to give her some news.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will remember," [...] said Chapeau, [...] "that he sent us word to Chatillon, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{not leave}} alive in La Vendée a father or mother to lament their children, {{or a child}} to lament its parents: those were bitter words; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will be sorry to have them brought to his memory just at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well-a-day, ay," [...] {{answered}} the afflicted damsel; [...] "but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> could mak fair terms for us--or, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> could gie us some good advice--or, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> might send his {{orders to the}} dragoons to be civil--or"-- ...|$|R
5000|$|... “He’s really good,” Wright told Parrish. “Maybe I haven’t {{followed}} {{him as well}} because he’s from the Midwest, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> wouldn’t surprise anybody else. But he’s got great size, he {{puts it on the}} floor, he passes it, he can shoot it. He’s just a ballplayer.” When asked if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be an NBA player, Wright answered [...] "yes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fulkerson {{could not}} forego {{the chance of}} a joke. [...] "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather temper justice with mercy in a case like his." [...] This made both the younger ladies laugh. [...] "I judge this is my chance to get off with my life," [...] he added, and he rose as he spoke. [...] "Mrs. Leighton, I am about the only man of my sex who doesn't thirst for Beaton's blood most of the time. But I know him and I don't. He's more kinds of a good fellow than people {{generally}} understand. He doesn't wear his heart upon his sleeve-not his ulster sleeve, anyway. You can always count me on your side when it's a question of finding Beaton not guilty if he'll leave the State." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stayed in}} the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I {{reckoned}} the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I {{made up my mind}} I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened.|$|E
6000|$|By {{that time}} Tom Chist {{had grown into}} a strong-limbed, thick-jointed boy of {{fourteen}} or fifteen years of age. It was a miserable dog's life he lived with old Matt Abrahamson, for the old fisherman was in his cups {{more than half the}} time, and when he was so there was hardly a day passed that he did not give Tom a curse or a buffet or, as like as not, an actual beating. One would have thought that such treatment would have broken the spirit of the poor little foundling, but it had just the opposite effect upon Tom Chist, who was one of your stubborn, sturdy, stiff-willed fellows who only grow harder and more tough the more they are ill-treated. It {{had been a long time}} now since he had made any outcry or complaint at the hard usage he suffered from old Matt. At such times he would shut his teeth and bear whatever came to him, until sometimes the half-drunken old man would be driven almost mad by his stubborn silence. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stop in the midst of the beating he was administering, and, grinding his teeth, would cry out: [...] "Won't ye say naught? Won't ye say naught? Well, then, I'll see if I can't make ye say naught." [...] When things had reached such a pass as this Molly would generally interfere to protect her foster son, and then she and Tom would together fight the old man until they had wrenched the stick or the strap out of his hand. Then old Matt would chase them out of doors and around and around the house for maybe half an hour, until his anger was cool, when he would go back again, and for a time the storm would be over.|$|E
5000|$|... “But I {{never lost}} hope. Slowly, I {{made a name}} for myself until {{eventually}} my father began to appreciate what I was doing. Time came when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> boast to everyone that I am his son. Wherever he went, he always announced that Ted Failon is his son. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> finally realized that this stubborn son of his can be of good use anyway.” ...|$|R
60|$|Billy Byrne {{thought that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{look in on}} his mother, not that he {{expected}} to be welcomed even though she might happen to be sober, or not that he cared to see her; but Billy's whole manner of thought had altered within the year, and something now seemed {{to tell him that}} it was his duty to do the thing <b>he</b> contemplated. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> might even be of help to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{tell me the}} particulars, will you? I don't go {{out much}} an' so I don't hear nuthin'. But an accident! Ain't it awful? But I always said it was risky to ride on the railroad; I told Jimmie so a hundred times. But <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go to Crawford an' now <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> a corpse. You are sure you didn't see a tall, thin young man, with a wart on his chin, that was cut up?" ...|$|R
50|$|It was a {{peculiar}} {{stroke of luck}} that he found a human duplication machine. It was an old machine, and it didn't work reliably after the first five copies were made. But if he could just duplicate the right world leaders, essentially make extra copies of them, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have a chance bringing peace to Earth and Venus.|$|E
5000|$|His mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, [...] "I {{would like}} Stephen {{to be remembered}} as a young man who had a future.

50|$|Alydar's partisans {{assumed that}} the 1 mile {{distance}} of the Belmont, two furlongs longer than the Derby and 5/16 of a mile longer than the Preakness Stakes, would favor Alydar with his finishing style and staying pedigree, and he would deny Affirmed the Triple Crown. Trainer Veitch removed Alydar's blinkers for the Belmont, saying that if Alydar got {{a better look at}} Affirmed, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get by him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> {{sorry and}} <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't," [...] muttered Stanley. [...] "I guess {{he ought to}} have a thrashing. Anyway, I am done with him," [...] and he flung back the coat Tom had offered him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't fancy I don't {{feel for}} the poor young gentleman--God help him!--I've been through it all--or not through it, that's to say.

5000|$|Father {{told him}} hopeful sponsor to mind his own business, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{take care of}} his family the way he wanted to and nobody was going to tell him what to do.
