For <b>REF</b> analysis, DNAs were digested with the BglII restriction enzyme and the resultant fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For ribotyping, hybridization of BglII genomic fragments with a probe of rrnB operon using an Escherichia coli rDNA probe was performed on all isolates. Although many isolates shared a common pattern by BglII <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> BglII ribotyping analysis, differences among some S. hyodysenteriae isolates were observed. <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> ribotyping using BglII restriction enzyme, were not specific for serotypes. The predominance of an <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> a ribotype pattern among S. hyodysenteriae isolates from Quebec suggested that epidemiologically important S. hyodysenteriae types occur in different swine herds...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{herpes simplex}} virus ICP 27 protein in mRNA export is {{investigated}} by microinjection into Xenopus laevis oocytes. ICP 27 dramatically stimulates the export of intronless viral mRNAs, but {{has no effect on}} the export of cellular mRNAs, U snRNAs or tRNA. Use of inhibitors shows, in contrast to previous suggestions, that ICP 27 neither shuttles nor exports viral mRNA via the CRM 1 pathway. Instead, ICP 27 -mediated viral RNA export requires <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> TAP/NXF 1, factors involved in cellular mRNA export. ICP 27 binds directly to <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> complexes containing ICP 27, <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> TAP are found in vitro and in virally infected cells. A mutant ICP 27 that does not interact with REF is inactive in viral mRNA export. We propose that ICP 27 associates with viral mRNAs and recruits TAP/NXF 1 via its interaction with REF proteins, allowing the otherwise inefficiently exported viral mRNAs to access the TAP-mediated export pathway. This represents a novel mechanism for export of viral mRNAs...|$|R

While the Amharic transcription was much slower than that of Swahili to complete, the speech recognition systems developed using <b>REF</b> <b>and</b> TRK transcriptions have almost similar (40. 1 vs 39. 6 for Amharic and 38. 0 vs 38. 5 for Swahili) word recognition error rate.

40|$|Expert {{opinion is}} an opinion given by an expert, {{and it can}} have {{significant}} value in forecasting key policy variables in economics and finance. Expert forecasts can either be expert opinions, or forecasts based on an econometric model.
