It became the replacement in the professional video and broadcast television industries for the then-incumbent 2 inch quadruplex videotape (2 inch Quad for short) open-reel format, due to the smaller size, comparative ease of operation (vs. 2 inch) and slightly higher video quality of 1 inch type C video tape recorder (VTR). 1 inch type C required less <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> than quadruplex videotape, and did not require time base correction to produce a stable video signal.|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{modeling}} of <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> distribution requires sufficient and good quality data. However, {{in the absence}} of those conditions of data, an alternative method using expert opinion inputs is usually employed. Literature on the applications of expert opinion in modeling <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> is found fairly limited. This study aims to fill in that gap and suggest a practical way of incorporating expert opinion in the modeling. A case study of an offshore gas compression train system is presented here to describe the approach used in {{modeling of}} preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> using expert opinion. Using right set of questionnaires and a fractile technique, downtime distributions are successfully elicited from expert. The comparison analysis shows that the downtime distribution derived from expert opinion is tighter than the one estimated solely based on raw plant maintenance data, indicating that the expert opinion approach is a good alternative for estimating the downtime measures of maintenance tasks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] There {{have been}} a number of methods {{presented}} by various researchers for traffic prediction, some of which involve modeling the problem of traffic prediction as a time series. It has been observed that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) perform better than statistical methods for time series forecasting. The network performance and complexity varies with the choice of algorithm used. Back propagation (BPNN) has been used to predict IP traffic with a fair degree of accuracy but as the prediction interval increases and the inputs change drastically the forecasting accuracy suffers [9]. This paper discusses the use of Focused Time Delay Feed Forward Neural Network architecture to predict IP traffic patterns and overcome the short comings of back propagation neural networks when used for traffic forecasting along with improvements to the BPNN by using additional inputs like holidays and <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtimes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a component-level maintenance model {{to evaluate the}} impact of maintenance on a component`s performance. The model uses a Markov approach to include both the beneficial and adverse effects of maintenance which considers the degraded state of a component, {{in addition to its}} operational state and failed state. The beneficial effect of maintenance relates to its effect in improving the reliability of the component, i. e., maintenance corrects degradations before failures occur. The adverse effects of <b>maintenance</b> includes <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtimes</b> and maintenance-related errors, which traditionally are included in component-level models of a probabilistic risk assessment.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of valuable operational life of an frontline aircraft can be conserved and effectively utilized for routine operational requirements, if component replacement downtime can be avoided during the operational cycle of an frontline aircraft. Component replacement downtime compounds to the existing scheduled routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtimes</b> and at times it extends much longer as certain critical components replacements warrants {{for a series of}} post replacement checks during flying prior declaring aircraft fit for routine operational commitments without restrictions.

With respect to the importance of taking into account the criterion of cost per unit of time, the reliability criterion and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> in making a proper maintenance decision need to be integrated in considering maintenance scheduling in a multi-criterion environment.

30|$|In this section, {{the methods}} used in this {{research}} have been reviewed. In this research, multi-criterion decision making methods {{have been used to}} model a maintenance planning. Three criteria as reliability, maintenance cost, and <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtime</b> have been considered to make the best replacement intervals for preventive maintenance. In order to compensate the loss of historical data, Bayesian analysis has been used. This research has chosen PROMETHEE II method to outrank the results because of fast use, easy-to-analyze results, and a flexible comparison process. This method requires criteria weights reflecting the subjective relative importance of the criteria by decision makers.

40|$|Gearboxes and {{induction}} motors {{are important}} components in industrial applications and their monitoring condition {{is critical in}} the industrial sector so as to reduce costs and <b>maintenance</b> <b>downtimes.</b> There are several techniques associated with the fault diagnosis in rotating machinery; however, vibration and stator currents analysis are commonly used due to their proven reliability. Indeed, vibration and current analysis provide fault condition information {{by means of the}} fault-related spectral component identification. This work presents a methodology based on vibration and current analysis for the diagnosis of wear in a gearbox and the detection of bearing defect in an induction motor both linked to the same kinematic chain; besides, the location of the fault-related components for analysis is supported by the corresponding theoretical models. The theoretical models are based on calculation of characteristic gearbox and bearings fault frequencies, in order to locate the spectral components of the faults. In this work, the influence of vibrations over the system is observed by performing motor current signal analysis to detect the presence of faults.
