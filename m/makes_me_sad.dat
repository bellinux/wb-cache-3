500|$|Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone {{cited the}} episode {{as an example}} of the series' decline. Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices wrote [...] "I have to look at this special like the 'Friend or Foe?' special. While 'WhoBob WhatPants?' works well as a regular story for SpongeBob SquarePants, I'm not entirely {{convinced}} that it deserved to be hyped up as a special. While this story had the potential to be 'special material,' it just didn't materialize in the final produced product." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said, [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sad</b> to think about how something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "With a laugh-skimpy script, 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' may be confirming a trend I noticed back with the last original SpongeBob toon to get its own disc release, Pest of the West: SpongeBob shorts are starting to get tired. And 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' is even less funny than 'Pest of the West'," [...] adding the episode was [...] "Not a good sign." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{during the}} American {{leg of the}} tour, {{internal}} friction started to form between {{the members of the}} trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed [...] "an ever widening personal gulf" [...] between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sad.</b> I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people." [...] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of [...] "Rid of Me." [...] As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.|$|E

2500|$|Carr {{participated in}} the {{investigation}} of the JFK assassination. He led the state probe and cooperated with the Warren Commission, which was appointed by President Johnson to determine the circumstances leading to Kennedy's death. Carr said that the combined state-federal probe was a success and that both teams worked well together. Years later, at the dedication of the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin, Carr recalled that the investigation into the Kennedy assassination was thorough and professional: [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sad</b> that it [...] happened, but it doesn't make me sad to share with the interested people of Texas about what this investigation revealed and how thorough it was and how nonpolitical it was." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Impatient" [...] is a pop ballad that {{explores the}} theme of {{difficult}} relationships, where one feels emotionally neglected but sticks around because they still have very strong feelings towards their partner. Abreu sings 'you say you listen but you never do' and 'you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>sad</b> when I'm happy'. However, rather than be deluded, she is {{fully aware of the}} negativity the relationship is causing, but is unable to break away due to her love for her partner: 'still I go weak when you just look at me'. The song ends with Abreu providing a clear ultimatum: 'let me love...or let me be free'.|$|R
