Patients received either <b>Mipragoside</b> 0. 5 % aqueous ophthalmic gel or placebo {{four times a day}} for 2 weeks after a week of treatment with placebo, Ocular signs and symptoms were evaluated and considered for statistical analysis, Results show that <b>Mipragoside</b> significantly reduces all symptoms, being most effective on itching (p = 0. 01; p = 0. 0001) and hyperaemia (p = 0. 01; p = 0. 0006) after 1 and 2 weeks respectively when compared with placebo, Physician judgement of drug efficacy at the end of treatment was significantly in favour of <b>Mipragoside</b> (p = 0. 0001) compared with placebo, We conclude that <b>Mipragoside</b> topical treatment improves symptoms of patients,vith vernal keratoconjunctivitis and we postulate a possible anti-inflammatory activity of this compound...|$|E
