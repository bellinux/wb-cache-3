5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> {{is similar}} to {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) in that it permits the replication of DNA sequence. The fundamental {{difference between the two}} methods is that <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> involves replication of the DNA in a living microorganism, while PCR replicates DNA in an in vitro solution, free of living cells.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} described {{the use of}} extended polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify contiguous 9. 2 -kilobase (kb) single-long terminal repeat (LTR) proviral sequences from HIV- 1 genetic subtypes A through G. We now extend these findings by describing a novel vector system to recover infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> from long PCR amplicons. Directional ligation of 9. 2 -kb proviral amplicons into a recovery vector reconstitutes missing LTR sequences, providing candidate <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> for infectivity screening. We show that a previously characterized infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> of HIV- 1 retains its biological properties upon recovery with this strategy. Three additional infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> generated, from primary isolates of subtype B (HIV- 1 WR 27) and circulating recombinant form 01 _AE (subtype E) (HIV- 1 CM 235) by subtype-specific LTR reconstitution, displayed biological properties reflecting their cognate parental isolates. This represents the first report of infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> from circulating recombinant form 01 _AE (subtype E) ...|$|R
40|$|The heavy-chain {{switch from}} {{immunoglobulin}} M (IgM) expression to IgA expression is mediated by a recombination event between segments of DNA called switch regions. The switch regions lie {{two to six}} kilobases upstream of the mu and alpha constant region coding segments. Switch recombination to IgA expression results in a recombinant mu-alpha switch region upstream of the expressed alpha constant region gene. We have characterized the products of switch recombination by a lymphoma cell line, I. 29. Two sets of <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> represent the expected products of simple mu to alpha switches. Five members of a third set of <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> share the same recombination site in both the mu and the alpha switch regions, implying that the five <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> were derived from a single switch recombination event. Surprisingly, the five clones fall into two sets of sequences, which differ from each other by several point mutations and small deletions. Duplication of switch region sequences are also found in these five <b>molecular</b> <b>clones.</b> An explanation for these data is that switch recombination involves DNA synthesis, which results in nucleotide substitutions, small deletions, and duplications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{full-length}} <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) pBLV-IF {{with two}} copies of a long terminal repeat (LTR) was constructed from a previously isolated, covalently closed, circular DNA clone, pB 6490, that has one copy of the LTR and the pX region split at anEcoRI site. This <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> directed the synthesis of viral proteins and the induction of syncytia in transiently transfected cells. In addition, virus particles were released into the culture medium. Serial passages of transient transfectants also resulted in propagation of BLV. After transfection of five cell lines with linearized pBLV-IF and a neomycin-resistance gene, BLV-producing transfectants were established in cell lines COS- 1 and 23 CLN that did not form syncytia upon expression of BLV. In HeLa and FLK cells, BLV produced by a stable COS- 1 transfectant was transmitted by both cell-free and cell-to-cell infection. Thus, pBLV-IF encoded an infectious provirus that successfully induced primary and secondary infections. This study indicates that the infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> and the virus-producing transfectants could be useful for further examination of the biological properties of BLV...|$|R
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> {{is a set}} of {{experimental}} methods in molecular biology that are used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms. The use of the word cloning refers {{to the fact that the}} method involves the replication of one molecule to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules. <b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms: the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species that will serve as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA. <b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{very large}} number of host organisms and <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> vectors are in use, the great {{majority}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments begin with a laboratory strain of the bacterium E. coli (Escherichia coli) and a plasmid cloning vector. E. coli and plasmid vectors are in common use because they are technically sophisticated, versatile, widely available, and offer rapid growth of recombinant organisms with minimal equipment. If the DNA to be cloned is exceptionally large (hundreds of thousands to millions of base pairs), then a bacterial artificial chromosome or yeast artificial chromosome vector is often chosen.|$|E

40|$|The leukemogenic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) retroviruses such as MCF 247 have {{biological}} properties {{distinct from}} those of their ecotropic progenitors. Nucleotide sequences encoding portions of gp 70, Prp 15 E, and the long terminal repeat differ between {{the two types of}} viruses. To investigate the role of each of these genetic elements in determining the biological properties of MCF viruses, we prepared infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> of MCF 247 and generated a set of recombinants between these <b>clones</b> and a <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> of Akv, the ecotropic parent of MCF 247. Each <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> of MCF 247 was distinct. All the recombinants between Akv and MCF 247 yielded infectious virus upon transfection. Most interestingly, recombinants which contain the long terminal repeat of MCF 247 were found to have an in vitro host range property that has been correlated with high oncogenic activity and thymotropism of certain MCF isolates; namely, they plated with higher efficiency on SC- 1 cells than on NFS mouse embryo cells. Nononcogenic MCF isolates showed a slight preference for NFS cells, whereas Akv virus plated with approximately equal efficiency on the two cell types...|$|R
40|$|Together {{with their}} simian T-cell {{lymphotropic}} virus (STLV) equivalent, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), HTLV- 2, and HTLV- 3 form the primate T-cell lymphotropic virus (PTLV) group. Over the years, understanding the biology and pathogenesis of HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 {{has been widely}} improved by the creation of <b>molecular</b> <b>clones.</b> In contrast, so far, PTLV- 3 experimental studies have been restricted to the overexpression of the tax gene using reporter assays. We have therefore decided to construct an STLV- 3 <b>molecular</b> <b>clone.</b> We generated a full-length STLV- 3 proviral clone (8, 891 bp) by PCR amplification of overlapping fragments. This STLV- 3 <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> was then transfected into 293 T cells. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments followed by sequence analysis of the amplified products allowed us to establish that both gag and tax/rex mRNAs were transcribed. Western blotting further demonstrated {{the presence of the}} STLV- 3 p 24 gag protein in the cell culture supernatant from transfected cells. Transient transfection of 293 T cells and of 293 T-long terminal repeat-green fluorescent protein cells with the STLV- 3 clone promoted syncytium formation, a hallmark of PTLV Env expression, as well as the appearance of fluorescent cells, also demonstrating that the Tax 3 protein was expressed. Virus particles were visible by electron microscopy. These particles are infectious, as demonstrated by our cell-free-infection experiments with purified virions. All together, our data demonstrate that the STLV- 3 <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> is functional and infectious. This clone will give us a unique opportunity to study in vitro the different pX transcripts and the putative presence of antisense transcripts and to evaluate the PTLV- 3 pathogenicity in vivo...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a transfection-neutralization assay for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones.</b> In this assay CD 4 negative adherent cells, transfected in microtiter plates with fixed amounts of proviral DNA of <b>molecular</b> HIV- 1 <b>clones,</b> are cocultivated with CD 4 positive T cell lines or primary {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) in the presence of anti-HIV- 1 sera or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Results obtained with this technique were reproducible and compared favorably with a conventional cell-free infection inhibition assay. The transfection-neutralization assay obviates the need for virus stock preparation and, therefore, is particularly suitable for the evaluation of HIV- 1 clones with slow replication kinetics and of recombinant chimeric HIV- 1 clones inclined to undergo additional mutations during stock preparation. The potential value of this assay for the analysis of the specificity of neutralizing sera and MAbs was demonstrated in experiments with V 3 chimeric <b>molecular</b> <b>clone...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PBj 14 isolate of simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus, SIVsmmPBj 14, is an acutely pathogenic lentivirus {{that causes}} severe gastrointestinal disease in macaque monkeys. The studies reported here examine {{the basis for}} the enteropathic phenotype of SIVsmmPBj 14, using flow cytometric analysis of cultured macaque lymphocytes and immunohistochemical staining of tissue specimens from virus-infected macaques. The data show that enteropathic <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> of SIVsmmPBj 14 induce expression of the αEβ 7 integrin, which is believed to mediate mucosal retention of T-cells, whereas <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> from nonenteropathic derivatives of SIVsmmPBj 14 do not do so. Thus, elevated expression of αEβ 7 may be responsible, at least in part, for the accumulation of abnormally large numbers of T-cells within the intestinal mucosa during acute SIVsmmPBj 14 infection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHIV- 2 GH- 1 is a <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> {{derived from}} an AIDS patient from Ghana. In {{contrast}} to the prototypic <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> ROD, GH- 1 exhibits a narrow range of target cell specificity. By an infectious assay using HeLa-CD 4 cells stably transfected with an HIV- 1 LTR-β-galactosidase reporter gene and transiently expressing various cloned chemokine receptors, we have examined the coreceptor usage of GH- 1. In contrast to ROD, which uses principally CXCR 4, GH- 1 was found to use mainly if not exclusively CCR 5 but not CXCR 4. The distinct coreceptor usage of these two <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> allowed us to further map the region of gp 120 that {{is important for the}} coreceptor specificity. By constructing a series of chimeric viruses between GH- 1 and ROD, we have demonstrated that the C-terminal half of the V 3 loop region of gp 120 determines the differential coreceptor usage between GH- 1 and ROD, and only a few amino acid differences in this region appear to be able to shift the specificity between CCR 5 and CXCR 4. Notably, the shift in the coreceptor usage from CCR 5 to CXCR 4 is associated with an increase in the net positive charge in the V 3 region...|$|R
25|$|In biology, cloning is {{the process}} of {{producing}} similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as bacteria, insects or plants reproduce asexually. Cloning in biotechnology refers to processes used to create copies of DNA fragments (<b>molecular</b> <b>cloning),</b> cells (cell cloning), or organisms. The term also refers to the production of multiple copies of a product such as digital media or software.|$|E
25|$|In {{standard}} <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of {{host organism}} and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of recombinant DNA {{is in many}} ways the simplest step of the <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA ligase) that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA mixture containing randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the host organism.|$|E
40|$|The Buda Thermal Karst System is {{an active}} hypogenic karst area that offers {{possibility}} {{for the analysis of}} biogenic cave formation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to gain information about morphological structure and genetic diversity of bacterial communities inhabiting the Diana-Hygieia Thermal Spring (DHTS). Using scanning electron microscopy, metal accumulating and unusual reticulated filaments were detected in large numbers in the DHTS biofilm samples. The phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were represented by both bacterial strains and <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> but phyla Acidobacteria, Chlorobi, Chlorofexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae and Thermotogae only by <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> which showed the highest similarity to uncultured clone sequences originating from different environmental sources. The biofilm bacterial community proved to be somewhat more diverse than that of the water sample and the distribution of the dominant bacterial clones was different between biofilm and water samples. The majority of biofilm clones was affiliated with Deltaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae while the largest group of water clones was related to Betaproteobacteria. Considering the metabolic properties of known species related to the strains and <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> from DHTS, it can be assumed that these bacterial communities may participate in the local sulphur and iron cycles, and contribute to biogenic cave formation...|$|R
40|$|The many genetic {{manifestations of}} HIV- 1 {{protease}} inhibitor (PI) resistance present challenges to {{research into the}} mechanisms of PI-resistance and the assessment of new PIs. To address these challenges, we created a panel of recombinant multi-PI resistant infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> designed to represent the spectrum of clinically relevant multi-PI resistant viruses. To assess the representativeness of this panel, we examined the sequences of the panel 2 ̆ 7 s viruses {{in the context of}} a correlation network of PI-resistance amino acid substitutions in sequences from more than 10, 000 patients. The panel of recombinant infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> comprised 29 of 41 study-defined PI-resistance amino acid substitutions and 23 of the 27 tightest amino acid substitution clusters. Based on their phenotypic properties, the clones were classified into four groups with increasing cross-resistance to the PIs most commonly used for salvage therapy: lopinavir (LPV), tipranavir (TPV), and darunavir (DRV). The panel of recombinant infectious <b>molecular</b> <b>clones</b> has been made available without restriction through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The public availability of the panel makes it possible to compare the inhibitory activity of different PIs with one another. The diversity of the panel and the high-level PI resistance of its clones suggest that investigational PIs active against the clones in this panel will retain antiviral activity against most, if not all clinically relevant PI-resistant viruses...|$|R
40|$|The genome of {{infectious}} salmon anemia virus (ISAV), which infects farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), is characterized here. The virus has an RNA genome, {{as shown by}} using specific DNA virus metabolic inhibitors and radioactive in vivo labeling of ISAV nucleic acid. Electrophoresis of [14 C]uridine-labeled ISAV RNA revealed that the ISAV genome is segmented. The genome consists of eight segments that range from 1. 0 to 2. 3 kb, with a total molecular size of approximately 14. 5 kb. One ISAV-specific <b>molecular</b> <b>clone,</b> corresponding to the smallest genome segment, was obtained by cDNA cloning of mRNA from an ISAV-infected cell culture. This clone gave a positive hybridization signal on Northern blots of pelleted ISAV. Pretreatment of the ISAV pellet with RNase A resulted in {{the disappearance of the}} positive hybridization signal, demonstrating that the genome is single stranded. Reverse transcriptase PCR with primers corresponding to sequences from the <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> and target RNA from ISAV-infected and noninfected fish tissues gave specific positive reactions. Alignments of the nucleotide sequence of the <b>molecular</b> <b>clone</b> did not reveal significant homology with any other available sequence in databases. However, the data presented here, together with morphological and replicational properties previously described, indicate that ISAV has a strong resemblance to members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. This is the first thoroughly characterized orthomyxo-like virus isolated from a teleost...|$|R
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} chemical structure of DNA is fundamentally the same in all living organisms. Therefore, if any segment of DNA from any organism is inserted into a DNA segment containing the molecular sequences required for DNA replication, and the resulting recombinant DNA is introduced into the organism from which the replication sequences were obtained, then the foreign DNA will be replicated along with the host cell's DNA in the transgenic organism.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously cloned DNA fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine {{a number of different}} clones {{to be sure that the}} desired DNA construct is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E
25|$|Specialized {{applications}} {{may call}} for specialized host-vector systems. For example, if the experimentalists wish to harvest a particular protein from the recombinant organism, then an expression vector is chosen that contains appropriate signals for transcription and translation in the desired host organism. Alternatively, if replication of the DNA in different species is desired (for example, transfer of DNA from bacteria to plants), then a multiple host range vector (also termed shuttle vector) may be selected. In practice, however, specialized <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments usually begin with cloning into a bacterial plasmid, followed by subcloning into a specialized vector.|$|E

25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) {{and gene}} splicing are terms {{that apply to}} the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as <b>molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>cloning</b> {{refers to}} the process of making {{multiple}} molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, {{but it can also be}} used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.|$|E
