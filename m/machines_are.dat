5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a card transaction is £3 {{which is more than}} the cost for a single ticket.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{the main}} building, the ticket office and ticket <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> {{immediately}} ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry {{is on the}} left; a bookshop is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays {{on each of the}} platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E
5|$|The Bell 212 is {{the primary}} {{helicopter}} used for flights to district villages. The older Sikorsky S-61N <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> stationed in Ilulissat Airport and Qaqortoq Heliport. With a capacity to seat 25 passengers, the S-61 based in southern Greenland was used to shuttle passengers arriving from Copenhagen at Narsarsuaq Airport. The sale of the Boeing 757 in April 2010 contributed to the long-term decline of the airport, with the airline planning to remove the old helicopter from the fleet. Three of the Bell 222 helicopters are taken out of active service and remain stationed in Kangerlussuaq Airport having been put up for sale.|$|E
50|$|Venn built rare machines. The {{function}} of the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> to bowl cricket balls.

5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose function is to aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types of <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their frames are rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, if one of Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or dash quickly to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|E
5|$|The metro {{operates}} with a proof-of-payment system, so riders {{must have}} a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK24, and a three-zone ticket DKK36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing {{can be a bit}} confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin. Passengers must specify, on their ticket which sub-zone they wish to travel to.|$|E
