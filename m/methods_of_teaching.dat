The essay explores different theories of motivation as a theoretical framework for analyzing gamification and teaching literature. After an in depth analysis of gamification the essay links the method to the motivational theories and to teaching literature. An example is also provided of what it might look like if gamification was applied to teaching English literature. In the end, conclusions can be drawn about what the effects of gamification would be as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> The essay will show that gamification can be a viable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> promoting student motivation but cannot be claimed to necessarily be a superior <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> compared to other methods and even comes with certain risks...|$|R

In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit, as witnessed by Samuel Hearne in 1771.

ICPs always conclude with a special deep relaxation yoga massage in shavasana, or corpse pose. An ICP can be adapted to almost any Jivamukti Yoga class, but is most frequently given in an Open class.|$|E

25|$|From about 1785 Reicha studied {{composition}} secretly, {{against his}} uncle's wishes, composing and conducting his first symphony in 1787 and entering the University of Bonn in 1789, {{where he studied}} and performed until 1794, when Bonn was attacked and captured by the French. He managed to escape to Hamburg, vowed never to perform in public again and began {{to earn a living}} teaching harmony, composition and piano. He continued composing and studied mathematics, philosophy and, significantly, <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> composition. In 1799 he moved to Paris, hoping to achieve success as an opera composer. These hopes were dashed, however: he could neither get his old librettos accepted nor find suitable new ones despite support from friends and influential members of the aristocracy, and moved on to Vienna in 1801.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, {{acquisition}} {{planning is}} {{integrated into a}} larger language planning {{process in which the}} statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities. This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> an official language or the development of a bilingual language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language’s script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language’s status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote language revitalization, which can change a language’s status or reverse a language shift, or to promote linguistic purism. In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.|$|E

500|$|After the Reformation the Humanist {{concern with}} {{education}} {{became part of}} a programme of godly education, with an attempt {{to establish a system}} of parish schools administered by the Church of Scotland (the [...] "Kirk").

In the seventeenth century there were attempts to organise and finance the system of parish schools and a successful expansion of the university system. By the early eighteenth century the network of parish schools was reasonably complete in the Lowlands, but limited in the Highlands where it was supplemented by Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Scotland began to reap the benefits of its university system, with major early figures of the Enlightenment including Francis Hutcheson, Colin Maclaurin and David Hume.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of {{the newly}} founded University of Iași, and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin. His life still lacked in stability, {{and he decided to}} move out of Grigoriu's {{supervision}} and into Bărboi Church, before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864. He contemplated leaving the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote Bolgrad. Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down, he had been attending Iași's Trei Ierarhi Monastery normal school (Trisfetite or Trei Sfetite), where he first met the young cultural figure Titu Maiorescu, who served as his teacher and supervisor, and whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865). Embittered by his own experience with the education system, Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu's ideas on education reform and modernization, and in particular of the new <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> reading and writing. During and after completing normal school, he was assigned to teaching positions at Trisfetite. While there, he earned the reputation of a demanding teacher (notably by accompanying his reports on individual students with characterizations such as [...] "idiot", [...] "impertinent" [...] or [...] "envious"). Accounts from the period state that he made use of corporal punishment in disciplining his pupils, and even surpassed the standards of violence accepted at the time.|$|E
