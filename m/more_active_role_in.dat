He played a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> events during the {{unfolding}} of the Apollo 13 crisis. Called into Mission Control by Gene Kranz almost immediately after the accident, Kraft chaired the meeting of senior managers which decided the mode that Apollo 13 would use to return to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU took no {{official}} position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 court-packing plan, which threatened {{to increase the}} number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> protecting civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|Tisch was {{technically}} the team's co-chief {{executive at}} first, however given {{his lack of}} football knowledge he chose to defer to Wellington Mara on football decisions in his initial seasons with the club. Although he later took a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> making decisions related to the football side of the team, in general, Tisch concentrated on the financial aspects, while Mara focused on the on-field product. After leading the league in attendance in 2001, the Giants finished second to Washington from 2002 to 2005.|$|E

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the House. In {{debate with}} Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering {{the return of}} fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan {{as part of a}} NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

25|$|Baptists welcomed African Americans, both {{slave and}} free, {{allowing}} them to have <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> ministry than did other denominations by licensing them as preachers and, in some cases, {{allowing them to}} be treated as equals to white members. As a result, black congregations and churches were founded in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia before the American Revolution. Some black congregations kept their independence even after whites tried to exercise more authority after the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831.|$|R

5|$|The New York {{class was}} the fifth of 11 {{separate}} classes planned by the United States Navy between 1906 and 1919, a total of 29 battleships and 6 battlecruisers. Virtually the entire American battle line was being designed from pre-dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs. The design of the New York-class battleship originated in the 1908 Newport Conference, {{which resulted in a}} new method for battleship design, with the General Board taking a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the design process of ships, and the navy's Board on Construction would implement the design instead of creating it.

5|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the News-Miner take a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{territorial}} politics. Prior to the 1948 election, Lathrop believed Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey would handily defeat Democratic incumbent Harry Truman. To {{take advantage of the}} anticipated governmental shift, Lathrop instructed the News-Miner to ramp up its pro-Republican editorials. In order to assist that process, he appointed William Strand, a war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as the News-Miner's new editor. Though Truman won the 1948 election, the News-Miner stayed politically active in endorsing Republican candidates and issues. This ended only with Lathrop's death on July 26, 1950.|$|E

In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus shell that contains her power.|$|E
5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of this was her participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much of a role as she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E
40|$|As the {{technological}} environment changes and libraries assume new and <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> their institutions, the traditional library hierarchy {{ceases to be}} an effective organizational structure. Guided by theories that emphasize teamwork, quality, and employee empowerment and participation, libraries are developing flatter, more networked organizations. The Health Sciences Library at Columbia University in New York, New York, recently underwent a reorganization in an effort to become a more resilient, more flexible organization. The process was beneficial overall. While some errors and confusion occurred, these are seen as opportunities for learning and evidence of the library's new atmosphere of creativity and experimentation...|$|R

Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop if it was not either given a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E

According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in Africa, but gave way when his mother protested. In 46BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey, Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{election}} Theobald selected his brother Walter to be archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1148 promoted {{him to be}} Bishop of Rochester. Theobald attended the council held by Stephen in June 1139 that deprived Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, of their castles. According to most historians, Theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council, which eventually ended with Roger's death in 1139 and Nigel and Alexander's restoration to favour. Recently however, that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that Theobald took a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the council. They base their view on a Vita, or Life of the 12th-century mystic Christina of Markyate, which narrates the events and gives a more central role to Theobald, instead of Henry of Blois, in challenging Stephen's arrest of the three bishops.|$|E

Defining feasibility by access, however, derives from a basic research model that translates poorly to a collaborative one. At the same time, university–community collaboration within externally funded research poses a number of ethical challenges. We encourage a redefinition of feasibility that prioritizes collaboration by reconstructing the purpose and content of letters of support and by encouraging investigators to build into studies sufficient time and specific plans for building sustainable partnerships...|$|R
