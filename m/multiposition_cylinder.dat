40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pneumatic/hydraulic operated cylinder composed of several cylinder modules arranged in succession in the axial direction, {{each of which}} guidess a piston which {{has at least one}} piston rod set {{to one side of the}} piston, whereby the front cylinder module has an opening at its front end face permitting the piston rod to pass through, and in said opening the piston rod extendable out of the cylinder at said face side and connected to the piston of the front cylinder module is guided, each cylinder module, with the exception of the rear, end-side closed cylinder module, having a piston rod passage opening for the piston rod and its rear end face, said piston rod being connected to the piston guided in the next cylinder module, and whereby each cylinder module is provided with an inlet and outlet for the hydraulic/pneumatic medium at least in the area of its rear end face and in the area of the front end face. The task of specifying a cylinder which permits more tha n two defined positions of the piston rod such as the known <b>multiposition</b> <b>cylinder,</b> but in comparison having a simple and compact design, is characterized by the fact that, according to the solution provided by the invention, the cylinder modules (1, 2, 3, 4) in the cylinders of the type described above are designed so that the maximum possible piston stroke length in the rearmost [...] ...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} work: the development and investigation of the distance-controllable balanced manipulator provided with the pneumatic drive, possessing the high quick-action and accurate shut-down for the leading-out of {{the man from the}} harmful zone. The mathematical model of the distance-controllable pneumatic balanced manipulator has been developed, in the ground of which the maximum quick-action has been laid with obtaining the high accuracy in positioning, including the modeling of the transient processes in the long pipeline and pneumatic drive. The construction of the <b>multiposition</b> pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> and the manipulator with balancing the weight has been developed. The characteristics of the transient processes in the long communication lines have been obtainedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
