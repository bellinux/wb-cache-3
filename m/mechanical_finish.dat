40|$|In {{the last}} issue of Starinar (LXII/ 2012) a {{contribution}} On Neolithic Authenticity of Finds from Belica was published. The authors Dragana Antonović and Slaviša Perić (further A-P), dispute the 'Neolithic' provenience of finds {{from the village}} Belica. The reason is based on two articles published by me and possibly the pending publication in Tübingen of my monograph Belica, the Greatest Group Find of Neolithic Artistic Cult Sculpture. A-P based their conclusion that the objects from Belica are not 'Neolithic' {{on the premise that}} the pit with these objects did not exist, that the objects are of 'contemporary provenience', most probably made by 'an archeologist-amateur aiming to create confusion in Serbian archaeology', that there are 'no analogies for them', that the site in Belica represents 'a small Neolithic settlement', that 'objects were made mechanically' and that traces of fast revolving 'grinding instruments' are visible on them. Also, A-P cite me as the only author to have written about the find from Belica and who believes that the find belongs to the Neolithic period. Technical, geodetic and photo documentation from systematic excavations, as well as the homogeneity of protostarčevo material confirm the existence of a pit, belonging to early Neolith. Four radiocarbon tests prove, apart from the characteristics of the material and the analogies, that the objects are not 'contemporary provenience' but belong to the Early Neolithic period. In connection with the possibility, as A-P state, that 'an archaeologist-amateur [...] . dug in the finds in the earth. ' aiming to 'produce confusion in Serbian archaeology' I cite here what this 'archaeologist-amateur' needed to know to do this. He needed to shape artistically 93 objects of four typically Neolithic materials, stone, flint, bone and pottery (16 pottery, 66 stone, 11 bone objects) and to dig them in clandestinely, together with some protostarčevo pottery. He would need to find various types of stone which are not found in the region, such as serpentine and albite, and to make several dozen objects from them; to find animal bones (Bos/Cervus), from the protostarčevo period and make a large number of figurines exclusively of this material; then using baked clay (as A-P state), also from the protostarčevo period, make anthropomorphic figurines. He would then have to put all these objects into a pit which he dug out in the centre of the Neolithic site, surrounded by a trench 75 m in diameter and then cover it with a great quantity of ochre. To fill up the pit clay of specific content would have to be transport from somewhere else. He would also need to have excellent knowledge of the religious symbols of Neolith, (particularly the connection of the symbolism of woman and moon, as well as the symbolism of moon, woman, snake etc.), to shape such objects which stylistically, typologically, chronologically and symbolically completely correspond with the cultural tradition of the Stone Age of Europe, Asia Minor, Near and Middle East, including the ambivalent figures (which represent at the same time man and woman, i. e. male and female symbols, otherwise a recent term in archaeology) and to know how the vulva looks immediately before birth which was depicted on all figurines of woman in childbirth in Belica. The statement by A-P that 'there are no analogies' is not correct because numerous analogies are known in Serbia {{and other parts of the}} Balkan Peninsula as well as in Asia Minor, the Near and Middle East. As geomagnetic investigations confirm, the protostarčevo settlement in Belica, contrary to the opinion of A-P that it is 'a small Neolithic settlement', is one of the largest settlements from the Early Neolith in Serbia, covering an area of more than 7 ha. Also the statement, that parallel traces, such as those which exist on the surface and in grooves on the stone objects, are the remains of work with 'contemporary grind tools with a large number of rotations' is incorrect. The expertise of professional archeometrologists using a 3 D electron microscope in the Institute for geology in Heidelberg and an experiment by conservators from the University in Tübingen confirm that the finish of the outer surface and the finish of grooves on the objects of serpentine (expertise was carried out exactly on objects which A-P explicitly marked as examples of <b>mechanical</b> <b>finish)</b> was done with typical Neolithic techniques. The statement that I was the only one who wrote about the Belica finds and identified them as Neolithic, is also not true. Although it is not important in this discussion about the 'Neolithic originality' of the Belica find, the fact is that apart from me five other authors have written on this subject...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{finishing}} {{and polishing}} phases {{are essential to}} improve smoothness and shining {{on the surface of}} acrylic resins used to make removable orthodontic appliances. A good surface finishing reduces roughness, which facilitates hygiene, prevents staining and provides greater comfort to the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze the changes on surface morphology of acrylic resins during finishing and polishing phases. METHODS: Thirty discs (10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length) were made with acrylic resin and randomly divided into ten groups. The control group did not receive any treatment while the other groups received gradual finishing and polishing. The last group received the entire finishing and polishing procedures. Surface morphology was qualitatively analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively analyzed through a laser profilometer test. RESULTS: The acrylic resin surfaces without treatment showed bubbles which were not observed in the subsequent phases. Wearing out with multilaminated burs, finishing with wood sandpaper and finishing with water sandpaper resulted in surfaces with decreasing irregularities. The surfaces that were polished with pumice and with low abrasive liquids showed high superficial smoothness.

ECB can buff ultrahigh purity components to make them shine, without leaving residual stress, micro-cracks, and etc. The control parameters of the ECB process include current density, the rate of revolution of the buffing head, the buffing pressure on the surface, the concentration of electrolyte, the buffing time and others. Improper control parameter setting in the process will result in unsatisfactory surface quality. It is necessary to determine optimal control parameters of an ECB process with robust performance that can insure surface quality and process reliability. In this study, parametric analyses were conducted on electrochemical buffing technology. An ECB system with a CNC machine was established. The buffing head was clamped on the tool holder of the CNC machine. It was used {{on a flat surface}} for automatic surface buffing.

40|$|Burnishing is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>finishing</b> {{operation}} {{performed on}} workpieces {{to enhance their}} surface quality through plastic deformation. One of the main issues to understand the overall process is {{the behavior of the}} elastoplastic deformations caused by the burnishing ball on the workpiece. The first burnishing passes performed on the workpiece surface lead to its plastic strain and self-hardening, thus influencing the results of consecutive passes. Some references have studied the phenomenon of indentation, finding that there is a certain self-hardening coefficient threshold which allows to predict the presence of pile-ups {{at the edges of the}} indentation path. Nevertheless, burnishing is not a single-pass operation. On the contrary, burnishing a whole surface requires successive adjacent and/or overlapping passes, i. e., parallel passes separated consecutively a certain lateral pass width. No reference has been found in the literature defining the adequate values of the lateral pass width with regards to the pile-up effect to enhance the final topology of the burnished surface. This paper explores that influence by studying the presence of the pile-up effect after burnishing a single or several overlapping passes on two materials (aluminum and steel), by characterizing the topology of the generated path. Afterwards, two adjacent passes are performed, varying the lateral pass width, to compare the final surface roughness derived from each operation. An optimum value for the lateral pass width was found, to improve the final roughness after burnishing in different conditions and to increase the productivity of the process.
