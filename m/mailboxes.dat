5|$|Other masks provide {{situational}} benefits. For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies {{scattered throughout}} the four temples, the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster, and the Stone Mask renders Link invisible to most non-playable characters and enemies. Less valuable masks are usually involved only in optional side-quests or specialized situations. Examples include the Postman's Hat, which grants Link access to items in <b>mailboxes,</b> and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long side-quest to receive the Couple's Mask.|$|E
5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent them from being used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 <b>mailboxes,</b> 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, <b>mailboxes</b> in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E

Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E
5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student <b>mailboxes</b> are located {{on the ground floor of}} Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of vandalism to curbside <b>mailboxes,</b> numerous vandal-resistant boxes made of composite plastic or heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate have also entered the market.

25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} <b>mailboxes</b> with {{improved}} construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside <b>mailboxes</b> to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking <b>mailboxes</b> are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|E

The signal device must rise above the mailbox and be visible at a distance, and must not obscure the mailbox owner's name or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Canada Post requires all rural <b>mailboxes</b> to have a minimum interior dimensions of 45cm in length by 17.5cm in width by 17.5cm in height for a rectangular mailbox, and 45cm in length by 25cm in diameter {{in the case of a}} cylindrical mailbox.|$|E

25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside <b>mailboxes,</b> {{also known as}} rural <b>mailboxes.</b> These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an attached flag to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside <b>mailboxes</b> may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a letter box may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach wall-mounted <b>mailboxes</b> {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots.

They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Canada Post {{began to}} phase out {{door-to-door}} service in urban centres, in favour of community mailboxes—a process that was estimated to affect 32% of Canadian addresses (subdivisions built after 1985 already use community <b>mailboxes,</b> and customers using rural <b>mailboxes</b> would not be affected). The decision {{was meant to be}} a cost-cutting measure in the face of financial losses, due primarily to the decreased use of traditional mail in favour of electronic alternatives.|$|E
