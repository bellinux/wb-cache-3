40|$|The {{extension}} of the ATM infrastructure with wireless access and <b>mobility</b> <b>offer</b> a great service advantages and high traffic performances. Allowing the Wireless ATM network {{in order to maintain}} the already QoS of ATM networks, some protocols of wireline architecture should be updated. The adaptation of the existing protocols to wireless requires integrating radio access functionalities and terminal mobility management. This last is an important factor in provisioning multimedia applications over wireless link. It adds the advantages of guarantying resource availability to the mobile terminals with QoS requirements. Mobility management needs several tasks as paging, location updating, routing, and handover. Particularly, handover has an important role to improve the services of WATM system. It is one of the major tasks that are used to support continuous transmission for a mobile terminal into different radio coverage areas. This research focuses on presenting an optimized handover algorithm. We propose a flexible architecture for implementing handover procedure based on intelligent decision strategy. This architecture is able to actively deploy different handover type. It can manage different network situations and allow mobile terminal to be connected to the most suitable base station...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Wireless mobile {{devices are}} {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in society. As a result, aggregation of network connectivity {{through the use of}} mobile networks is becoming increasingly relevant to service providers as well as for mobile users. The current approach being pursued within the IETF Mobile Extensions for IPv 6 (MEXT) WG, is based on the Network Mobility (NEMO) architecture. NEMO uses IP-in-IP tunnelling for providing mobile network capability on an existing IPv 6 network. This approach can result in non-optimal routing between source and destination nodes. Other proposals such as OptiNets extend NEMO and try to address issues such as sub-optimal routing. There are alternative approaches also being proposed, such as the Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNPv 6), which is based on the use of naming, to enable a flexible and integrated mobile network capability based on IPv 6. We have conducted a comparative analysis of the cost of providing optimal routing, in terms of packet and bandwidth overhead, based on an emulation, using data from the London Circle Line metropolitan railway as a scenario. Our analysis shows that these different approaches to <b>mobility</b> <b>offer</b> significantly different performance trade-offs in routing for mobile networks, depending on the constraints of the network scenario.

However, to achieve complementarity, {{one of the two}} condction paths in transistors has to be suppressed, resulting in unipolar devices. Here, we adopt charge injection engineering through a specific interlayer in order to tune injection into frontier energy orbitals of a high mobility donor-acceptor co-polymer. Starting from field-effect transistors with Au contacts, showing a p-type unbalanced behaviour with μ h = 0. 29 cm 2 /V s and μ e = 0. 001 cm 2 /V s, through the insertion of a caesium salt interlayer with optimized thickness, we obtain an n-type unbalanced transistor with μ e = 0. 12 cm 2 /V s and μ h = 8 × 10 - 4 cm 2 /V s. We applied this result {{to the development of the}} basic pass-transistor logic building blocks such as inverters, with high gain and good noise margin, and transmission-gates. In addition, we developed and characterized information storage circuits like D-Latches and D-Flip-Flops consisting of 16 transistors, demonstrating both their static and dynamic performances and thus the suitability of this technology for more complex circuits such as display addressing logic. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|New {{forms of}} <b>mobility</b> <b>offer</b> {{opportunities}} to make urban areas along highways more resilient by using those specific areas for the ecological and functional improvement of the city. This requires spatial interventions that approach the highway, the buffer zone and the specific urban area along the highway as a whole rather than as separate zones that {{just happen to be}} juxtaposed. Anticipating new forms of mobility, how can we design the correlation between these spaces and how can these spaces foster resilient urban systems? To examine the correlation between highway and city, combinations of five highway prototypes and three urban types that represent the majority of urban territories along highways in the Netherlands are studied. The approach is executed in two phases: the polluted buffer zones will be cleaned in the first phase and the potential of the urban area will be activated in the second phase. This involves opportunities for waste- water treatment, energy production and newly built programme. How can the different combinations create spatial opportunities to enhance the resilience of a specific area? In this context, climate change, the energy transition and quality urbanization are of key importance. The need to mitigate and adapt changes in the hydrological cycle, to reduce energy dependency and find more renewable energy sources is increasing, {{but at the same time}} there is less space available to achieve these things. For each urban type, current qualities and opportunities to create a balanced relation between human and natural systems can be defined in relation to the present situation. The scale at which resilience influences the new urban systems shows the overwhelming potential of the space around the highway once new technological innovations in the field of mobility and environment are combined. New correlations between human and natural systems transform the as yet orphaned fragments of land into pioneer zones that enhance the resilience of the city by its improved ecology and additional housing programme. <br/...|$|E
40|$|THE REGION'S POTENTIAL IN THE INTEGRATION OF TRANSPORT SYSTEMS The {{transport}} system {{has always been}} the hinge of all processes of development of a modern industrialized economy. However, in our country, for several reasons, in recent decades the <b>mobility</b> <b>offer</b> has not met expectations, causing substantial critical, that only recently have called for a new infrastructure policy. The provision of mobility should recover a significant gap in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The problems to be solved are many and made more complex by the necessity to recover a significant delay, this threatens to marginalize us from a geographic European context in which Italy is a peripheral country. Many recent studies have highlighted how the failure of the road system are estimated approximately annually 15 million euros, that impact directly on productive component of the nation, even if measured only in terms of greater travel times due to congestion of the main extra urban network. An action of territorial balance must necessarily be directed towards the solution of those nodes of traffic which doesn’t allow a real operating system of main road network. However, as a strategy dictated by the emergency can be basically forced, this may not stem entirely or put into the background those actions necessary to ensure a balance of supply, both in terms of modal and development policy. This policy could penalize further, {{from the point of view}} of infrastructures, the already marginalized economies such as South of Italy. In this respect there is no doubt that a fundamental role in the reorganization of domestic and international mobility, can be played by an effective integration of maritime transport in the framework of an offer of transport projected to other Mediterranean countries. There is nothing new to acknowledge Southern Italy as a bridge to those markets that can solve the problem of its geographical marginalization, otherwise unavoidable.

40|$|Aim/Purpose: The {{topic of}} this study is the ICT-enabled {{transformation}} of car dealerships to regional providers of sustainable mobility (e. g., car sharing). Background: 	Car dealerships offer specific conditions that enable a sustainable <b>mobility</b> <b>offer,</b> based on individual motorized transport like car sharing. This is especially useful in small towns or rural areas where people’s mobility is strongly dominated by private cars, and public transport coverage is limited. However, these new mobility services are combined services with the need of a deep integration of information systems, and these services are not yet related to car dealerships and customer acquisition has to be supported. Methodology: An empirical study with an inductive approach was chosen. The study consists of interviews with three focus groups of different stakeholders of car dealerships. Within the frame of the research project, “ReCaB – Regional Car-Balancing” a qualitative research approach was chosen. Within a design science approach the existing SusCRM architecture was adapted based on the elaborated requirements. Contribution: A software architecture is proposed, where Customer Relationship Management (CRM) components to market new sustainable mobility offers are vital parts and existing information systems of car dealerships are integrated. Findings: The basic feasibility of the establishment and customer acceptance has been demonstrated, at least in the area of car sharing within ReCaB. The execution in the car sharing field has already started and a number of car dealerships are already bringing their own offers to market. Major findings for the SusCRM architecture have been elaborated in a design science approach in the national German research project “Showcase for electro mobility”. Recommendations for Practitioners: There is still no fully functional prototype developed for this specific use case and evaluated in the car dealership environment. An implementation only, based on own efforts, is difficult for car dealerships because of the dealership’s lack of know-how as well as tight IT budgets. However, this approach appears particularly successful in rural areas where public transport services are heavily declining. For full implementation, the presented ICT support is imperative. Recommendation for Researchers: 	The research on the retailer level, especially in combination with a digital trans-formation by the use of ICT systems, is still fragmentary. Research in this area that both addresses sustainability goals on a general level and supports economical goals on the company level of automotive retailers would be useful. Impact on Society: Creation of sustainable offers as a substitute or supplement for mobility based on their own car is a promising way to reduce negative effects of mobility. Enhancement of the mobility of the people in rural areas is leading to a more active lifestyle by reaching the leisure facilities, workplaces and educational institutions in a sustainable manner. Future Research: In terms of the fast changing mobility landscape, especially on a technical level with the development of autonomous vehicles and digitalization of entire businesses new solutions are becoming accessible, that have to be integrated in further research...|$|E
