We show that these digraphs retract either onto a directed path {{or to the}} disjoint union of directed cycles, showing in this way that the constraint satisfaction problem for Maltsev digraphs is in logspace, L. We then generalize results from Kazda (2011) {{to show that a}} Maltsev digraph is preserved not only by a <b>majority</b> <b>operation,</b> but by a class of other operations (e. g., minority, Pixley) and obtain a O(|VG| 4) -time algorithm to recognize Maltsev digraphs. We also prove analogous results for digraphs {{preserved by}} conservative Maltsev operations which we use to establish that the list homomorphism problem for Maltsev digraphs is in L. We then give a polynomial time characterisation of Maltsev digraphs admitting a conservative 2 -semilattice operation.

40|$|Among {{the local}} {{consistency}} techniques used for solving constraint networks, path-consistency (PC) {{has received a}} great deal of attention. However, enforcing PC is computationally expensive and sometimes even unnecessary. Directional path-consistency (DPC) is a weaker notion of PC that considers a given variable ordering and can thus be enforced more efficiently than PC. This paper shows that DPC (the DPC enforcing algorithm of Dechter and Pearl) decides the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of a constraint language if it is complete and has the variable elimination property (VEP). However, we also show that no complete VEP constraint language can have a domain with more than 2 values. We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC*, and show that the CSP of a constraint language can be decided by DPC* if it is closed under a <b>majority</b> <b>operation.</b> In fact, DPC* is sufficient for guaranteeing backtrack-free search for such constraint networks. Examples of majority-closed constraint classes include the classes of connected row-convex (CRC) constraints and tree-preserving constraints, which have found applications in various domains, such as scene labeling, temporal reasoning, geometric reasoning, and logical filtering. Our experimental evaluations show that DPC* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving majority-closed constraints...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} aggregating votes cast by a society on a fixed set of issues, where {{each member of the}} society may vote for one of several positions on each issue, but the combination of votes on the various issues is restricted to a set of feasible voting patterns. We require the aggregation to be supportive, i. e. for every issue j the corresponding component f_j of every aggregator on every issue should satisfy f_j(x_ 1,, [...] ., x_n) ∈{x_ 1,, [...] ., x_n}. We prove that, in such a set-up, non-dictatorial aggregation of votes in a society of some size is possible if and only if either non-dictatorial aggregation is possible in a society of only two members or a ternary aggregator exists that either on every issue j is a <b>majority</b> <b>operation,</b> i. e. the corresponding component satisfies f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =x, ∀ x,y, or on every issue is a minority operation, i. e. the corresponding component satisfies f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =y, ∀ x,y. We then introduce a notion of uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator, which is defined to be an aggregator that on every issue, and when restricted to an arbitrary two-element subset of the votes for that issue, differs from all projection functions. We first give a characterization of sets of feasible voting patterns that admit a uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator. Then making use of Bulatov's dichotomy theorem for conservative constraint satisfaction problems, we connect social choice theory with combinatorial complexity by proving that if a set of feasible voting patterns X has a uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator of some arity then the multi-sorted conservative constraint satisfaction problem on X, in the sense introduced by Bulatov and Jeavons, with each issue representing a sort, is tractable; otherwise it is NP-complete...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let A be {{a finite}} algebra with a {{majority}} term. We characterize those algebras categorically equivalent to A. The description {{is in terms of}} a derived structure with universe consisting of all subalgebras of A × A, and with operations of composition, converse and intersection. The main theorem is used to get a different sort of characterization of categorical equivalence for algebras generating an arithmetical variety. We also consider clones of co-height at most two. In addition, we provide new proofs of several characterizations in the literature, including quasi-primal, lattice-primal and congruence-primal algebras. <b>Majority</b> <b>operations</b> have long held a special place in universal algebra. It has been known for quite some time that any variety of algebras possessing a majority term is congruence distributive.

In addition, every subalgebra of Ak (with k ≥ 2) is completely determined by all of its 2 -fold projections. Conversely, G. Bergma...|$|R
