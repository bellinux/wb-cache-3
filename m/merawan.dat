40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{determine}} the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of two hardwood species of selected Malaysian timber, namely <b>Merawan</b> (Hopeaodorata) and Kelat (Syzygium chlorantha). Not many studies on antioxidant activity and total phenolic content have been conducted with the species selected. Therefore, this study was also carried out {{in order to determine the}} relationship between the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the selected species. Heartwood, sapwood, and bark of <b>Merawan</b> and Kelat were extracted with methanol using Soxhlet Extraction. The extracts were evaluated for antioxidant activity using 2, 2, diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity assay. The total phenol content (TPC) of the extracts were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE). The present study showed that the sapwood of <b>Merawan</b> had the highest TPC followed by <b>Merawan</b> sapwood and Kelat heartwood. All wood extracts showed good antioxidant activities however the heartwood extracts of both species exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity. The lowest EC 5 â€žvalues based on the DPPH radical scavenging activity were shown by <b>Merawan</b> heartwood extracts as compared to the other samples. The correlation between TPC and the antioxidant absorbance based on the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay were positive. Relatively, the present results suggest that of the two hardwood species tested, <b>Merawan</b> (Hopea odorata) has the highest antioxidant activity and the highest total phenol content and have shown potential candidate to be used as sources of natural antioxidants. ...|$|E

40|$|Volvariella volvaceae (Bull. Ex. Fr) or merang {{mushroom}} is {{the first}} consumption mushrooms that can be cultivated. Cultivating Merang Mushrom, requires growing medium that contains cellulose. Rice straw as a medium for growing merang mushrooms is getting lessen howadays, so to keep the continuity of merang mushroom production it needs an alternative media that have the same quality as rice straw. Dried banana leaves and corn stalks are remnant from agricultural production, while weeds are the weeds on agricultural land. these materials may be can used as an alternative media to replace rice straw in growing merang mushroom. This research was conducted in <b>Merawan,</b> Tapen district at Bondowoso Regency. The method of the research carries out with the basic pattern of Completely Randomized Design (CRD) that consist of single treatment that is planting medium consists of seven levels of growing rice straw media (M 0), dried banana leaves media (M 1), dried banana leaf + rice straw medium (M 2), corn stalks media (M 3), corn stalks + rice straw medium (M 4), weeds media (M 5), and weeds + rice straw medium (M 6) with four repetition, then further test used Duncan test level 5 %. It {{can be seen that}} production weigth, and toral number of fruit, the best result obtain on rice straw media treatment (M 0), while corn stalks media (M 3) can be used as priority alternative for replace rice straw because the total production is risen comparity to the other alternative growing media treatment.

While the short-term goal is to find information on average performance and predictive value of genetic parameters of agronomic traits Jatropha. This research was conducted at the experimental farm of agriculture faculty unsyiah which began in March 2013 to June 2013. This research used a randomized block design with 10 patterns of non-factorial treatment that G 1, G 2, G 3 genotypes of Jatropha is derived from ecotype Tebingtinggi, G 4, G 5, G 6 genotypes of Jatropha is derived from ecotype Dolok <b>Merawan,</b> G 7, G 8, G 9, and G 10 genotpes of Jatropha is derived from ecotypes Abdya with each henotype were repeated three replications {{in order to obtain}} 30 units of experimental units. The parameters measured were the growth of plant height, number of leaves, leaf lengt, leaf width, stem diameter, age 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days after planting and crop canopy age 90 days after planting. The result of this research indicated that there is no significant effect between the appearance of the growth of Jatropha as a result of treatment of different genotypes. The coefficient of genetic diversity in Jatropha relatively low criterion, whereas in the broad sense heritability values belonging to the low and moderate criteria. Highly significant genetic correlations between character growth occurs in plant height and stem diameter age 90 days after planting with r = 0. 82.

40|$|Airborne Laser Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for timber volume estimation especially in temperate region. Application of such technology in tropical region specifically in developing countries faces several challenges due to low penetration of laser pulses over tree canopy and relatively low density of point clouds due to the cost constraint. This paper presents a thorough investigation on the capability of ALS data in estimating density of vegetation over Ayer Keroh recreational forest, Melaka, Malaysia. The study area covers about 2 hectare and consists of more than 30 tree species, which dominated by <b>Merawan</b> Siput Jantan (Hopea odorata). The airborne LiDAR data was obtained using the Optech ALTM 3100 in 2009 with a posting density of about 0. 69 point per meter squared. The estimation of forest timber volume involves five main processing stages, i. e. 1) delineation of individual trees, 2) estimation of individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH) based on allometric equation, 3) estimation of crown diameter, 4) estimation of tree height and 5) estimation of timber volume. Individual tree crown segmentation {{is based on the}} inverse watershed (IW) segmentation routine and local maximum (LM) filtering in TreeVaw. Tree height and crown diameter of individual trees are calculated by using canopy height model (CHM) and crown segments. These parameters will be used as input in the allometric equation that is specially developed over tropical region to estimate tree DBH. Based on the estimated DBH, tree height and crown diameter, the timber volume will be calculated at a certain unit area by using a multiplicative method. The final timber volume map is validated using field collected data. In this study, the results are presented as a map of average of timber volume for every one acre in the study area. Correlation between field collected tree height, DBH, crown diameter and timber volume with values extracted based on the LM individual tree delineation are 0. 59, 0. 72, 0. 72 and 0. 79 respectively. On the other hand for IW segmentation, the correlation values for tree height, DBH, crown diameter and timber volume are lower than the LM approach with 0. 26, 0. 03, 0. 16 and 0. 05 respectively. The root mean square (RMSE) value for timber volume estimation by using IW segmentation capable of producing timber volume map with the accuracy about 111. 31 m 3 /acre. Whereas for LM filtering capable of estimating timber volume with RMSE of 73. 62 m 3 /acre...|$|E
