This was facilitated when the <b>municipal</b> <b>authority</b> inaugurated a 300-slip marina on 3 June 1986, but also, since Horta harbour is a fleet centre for the island ferries Transmaçor and Atlanticoline, it has resulted in new investments {{and the construction of}} a secondary pier for inter-island passenger traffic.|$|E

25|$|Masnedø is {{the site}} of an {{abandoned}} military defensive fort dating from 1912. The fort was a longstanding defensive position for Storstrømmen waters in wars against England and Sweden, but was also the first target in the world to be successfully attacked by paratroopers, in 1940, when it was captured by German Fallschirmjägers. The fort was taken over by the <b>municipal</b> <b>authority</b> in 1974, restored, and converted to an art gallery and home for music festivals.|$|E

25|$|Until Ocean Grove's <b>municipal</b> <b>authority</b> was {{folded into}} Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, {{including}} one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People looking to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). That meant the visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, two of the four gates still remained at the castle: one of the gates was destroyed intentionally by the municipality. This occurred even as in May 1950, the <b>municipal</b> <b>authority</b> placed a plaque on the interior arch, commemorating the 700 years since Mirandela's elevation to the status of town. The remains of the medieval wall, represented by the Santo António Gate, was classified as a Property of Public Interest by decree published on 20 October 1955. By the 1970s notices describe the castle of Mirandela as in ruin. Yet, in May 2000, another plaque was erected to mark the 750 anniversary of the towns elevation.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} rights of Coloured people varied by location and over time. In the 19th century they theoretically had similar rights to Whites in the Cape Colony (though income and property qualifications affected them disproportionately.) In the Transvaal Republic or the Orange Free State, they had few rights. Coloured members were elected to Cape Town's <b>municipal</b> <b>authority</b> (including, for many years, Abdurahman). The {{establishment of the}} Union of South Africa gave Coloured people the franchise, although by 1930 they were restricted to electing White representatives. They conducted frequent voting boycotts in protest. Such boycotts {{may have contributed to}} the victory of the National Party in 1948. They carried out an apartheid programme that stripped Coloured people of their remaining voting powers.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Trade were reticent about {{allowing}} a <b>Municipal</b> <b>Authority,</b> {{in this case}} Bradford, to build a railway which was located outside its area of jurisdiction, and was not connected to a railway which started within its area. However, on 30 December 1903, a transfer order was granted, with powers to borrow up to £30,000 to fund the project. In May 1904, the Board of Trade agreed to a change to standard gauge, and borrowing powers were increased to £66,000 in 1908, because of the extra costs of building the wider formation. The document was signed by Winston Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade. In addition to the main reservoir contract, John Best was awarded a contract to build the light railway to Lofthouse for £23,000, and a tramway from Lofthouse to Angram for £5,385.|$|E
