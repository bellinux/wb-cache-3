5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E

25|$|Engines grow {{in power}} with development, but a major war demands the utmost {{performance}} from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service {{was unlikely to}} exceed 50 hour's flying, {{over a period of}} only a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800's reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the Douglas DC-6, Martin 4-0-4, and Convair 240 transports. The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 and the first Constellations.|$|E

25|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{means of}} kudzu removal {{practiced in the}} southeastern United States involve mowing the vine or cutting it back. These methods, though more effective than herbicides, are more time consuming. Vines must be mowed down just above ground level every <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{during the growing season}} in order to prevent them from growing back. When using this method of kudzu control, all of the plant material must be removed and/or destroyed (burned) to prevent the vines from taking root and re-growing. Another method of mechanical removal is to remove the crown of the plant. This part must also be destroyed to prevent re-implantation.|$|E
25|$|The leg can be {{lengthened}} or shortened during surgery. Unequal {{legs are}} the most common complaint by patients after surgery with over lengthening the most common problem. Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. If the legs are truly equal, the sense of inequality resolves within a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of surgery. If the leg is unequal, it will not. A shoe lift for the short leg, or in extreme cases, a corrective operation may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The mild {{climate of}} the West Coast, {{especially}} California, allowed the league to play longer seasons, sometimes starting in late February and ending {{as late as the}} beginning of December. During the 1905 season the San Francisco Seals set the all-time PCL record by playing 230 games. Teams regularly played between 170 and 200 games in a season until the late 1950s. This allowed players, who were often career minor leaguers, to hone their skills, earn an extra <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of pay, and reduce the need to find off-season work. These longer seasons gave owners the opportunity to generate more revenue. Another outcome was that a number of the all-time minor league records for season statistical totals are held by players from the PCL.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E

Phillips returned his report on 16 October, calling for standing patrols by Hawker Hurricane fighters guided by searchlights, the so-called cat's eye fighters. Dowding replied that the speed and altitude of modern aircraft made such efforts almost useless, stating that Phillips was proposing to [...] "merely revert to a Micawber-like method of ordering them to fly about and wait for something to turn up." [...] He again stated that AI was the only solution to the problem. Phillips had not ignored AI, but pointed out that [...] "At the beginning of the war, AI was stated to be a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> ahead.

Next, the data are smoothed using a moving average filter to remove sources of idiosyncratic variation that are unrelated to the cyclical behavior of the variable (the smoothing step is omitted when using quarterly data due to the coarse frequency of the data). In addition, two important ad-hoc rules are added to an expression like (1). A restriction on the minimum length of a recession— 6 <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> quarters, depending on the frequency of the data—as well as a restriction on the minimum length of a complete recession-expansion cycle— 15 <b>months</b> <b>or</b> four quarters—ensure that the business cycles occur at the appropriate frequency.|$|R
