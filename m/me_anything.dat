The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E

Using an Ask <b>Me</b> <b>Anything</b> (AMA) format, the President garnered 3.8 million page views {{on the first page}} of his self-post. Users left 22,000 comments and questions for the President, 10 of which he answered. The answered questions' topics included more serious topics, from the most difficult decision made during his first term to a plan to end the corruption of money in politics. Some included a more lighthearted focus, like the recipe for the White House beer.|$|E
25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes <b>me</b> <b>anything,</b> but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

[...] On the issue of the LDS Church policy of the time that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, she defended the church, saying, [...] "If my church taught <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> other than that the Negro is equal to any other person, I could not accept it." [...] She {{was a member of the}} Women's City Club in Detroit, but in 1967, said she would resign unless the club dropped a policy barring black guests from eating in its dining room.|$|E

He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch.

500|$|Despite Netflix {{confirming}} {{multiple times}} within the month {{that there was}} nothing they could do for the show to return, fans continued to heavily campaign for it. On June 29, 2017, the official social media accounts of the show posted a letter by Lana Wachowski which announced the release of a two-hour special targeting 2018. In her letter, Lana thanked the fans, writing that it's only thanks to their strong collective voice that this was made possible. She also acknowledged the logistics of the show have always been challenging for Netflix. While Netflix billed the special in their announcement as the series finale, Lana left open the future of Sense8 past the special's release, writing about it, [...] "if this experience has taught <b>me</b> <b>anything,</b> you NEVER know." [...] In August 2017, Sarandos said that at first Lana had rejected Netflix's offer of a two-hour special, as her preference was to continue with a new season. She eventually agreed to it, having been influenced by the fans asking for more. Later in August, porn site xHamster wrote an open letter to the Wachowskis, offering to produce the third season, and a few days later received a call from Lana to whom they proposed to be the distribution platform. Screen Rant has criticized the move as one of the many publicity stunts that porn companies set out to do to advertise themselves, while Inverse wrote the Wachowskis would never take their show to a platform that uses pejoratives to refer to transgender people.|$|E
