40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential use of various solid wastes for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> The paper is based on the comprehensive review of available literature on the <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> including different kinds of solid wastes. The traditional methods for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> are using the valuable natural resources. Besides, the industrial and urban management systems are generating solid wastes, and most often dumping them in open fields. These activities pose serious detrimental effects on the environment. To safeguard the environment, many efforts are being made for the recycling of different types of solid wastes with a view to utilizing them in the production of various <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> This paper discusses the environmental implications caused by the generation of various solid wastes, and highlights their recycling potentials and possible use for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition, this paper shows the applications of solid waste based <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> in real <b>construction,</b> and identifies the research needs...|$|R

30|$|Model {{results also}} show that <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> {{influence}} vertical and earthquake load vulnerability significantly with a parameter value of 0.924 and 0.824, respectively (Table  2). <b>Construction</b> <b>materials</b> have a correlation value of 0.383 (Table  3) and 0.317 (Table  4) for vertical and earthquake load vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability to vertical and earthquake loads largely depend on the type and characteristics of the <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> used. The building assessment analysis identifies many cases where both quality of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>construction</b> practices were very poor. Yépez and Yépez (2017) found that substandard <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> and poor <b>construction</b> practice {{were some of the}} main reasons behind the collapse of thousands of buildings after the Ecuador earthquake in 2016. Bangladesh has not experienced a major earthquake since Great Indian Earthquake 1897 (Roy 2014; Chakravorti et al. 2015). But the country should be careful to maintain its construction quality in order to reduce vertical as well as earthquake load vulnerability to avoid a potential future disastrous situation.|$|R

40|$|Fast speed {{construction}} {{development is}} a key contributor to excessive carbon emissions. Apart from the operational emissions of construction facilities, more and more clients and designers {{are concerned about the}} carbon emissions embodied in <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> Despite the significance of this, little research has been conducted to reduce the use of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> of high carbon intensity. To significantly reduce the carbon emissions due to the use of <b>construction</b> <b>materials,</b> a fundamental rethink of the tendering mechanism is needed. In this paper, a carbon emission encompassed tender is proposed. The fundamental basis of the envisaged carbon emission encompassed tender is a transparent and equitable framework to estimate the carbon footprint of products. With the release of the ISO 14067, {{it is possible that the}} carbon footprint of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> can be systematically assessed at the product level. In this paper, the way in which the carbon footprint of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> is estimated is exemplified through a recently developed carbon labeling scheme. Then, the philosophy of the carbon emission encompassed tender is introduced. Finally, the challenges facing the implementation of the proposed carbon emission encompassed tender are highlighted. Through the carbon emission encompassed tender, contractors can get a reasonable reward to commensurate the carbon reduction attained through the use of low carbon <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R
