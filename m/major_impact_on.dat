5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century.

His ideas on race relations alone had a <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E

Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection).

5|$|Ida's major craters {{are named}} after caves and lava tubes on Earth.

The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's prime meridian.|$|E

5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Flightless birds that had {{previously}} known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had a <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change {{was caused by the}} use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans).|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on Scottish {{architecture}} began in the reign of James III in the late fifteenth century with the rebuilding of royal palaces such as Linlithgow, and reached its peak under James V. The Reformation had a <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> ecclesiastical architecture from the mid-sixteenth century onward, resulting in simple church buildings, devoid of ornamentation. From the 1560s great private houses were built in a distinctive style that became known as Scottish Baronial.

The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire.

5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation and discipline that would have a <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power {{in the name of the}} infant James VI. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.|$|E

Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
