30|$|The 57 - 64 GHz {{unlicensed}} bandwidth around 60 GHz {{can accommodate}} <b>multi-gigabits</b> per second (multi-Gbps) wireless transmission {{in a short}} range. There are several standards for 60 GHz systems, such as WirelessHD [1] and IEEE 802.15. 3 c [2, 3]. In both WirelessHD and the AV PHY mode in IEEE 802.15. 3 c, a concatenated FEC scheme is used with a RS code as the outer code and a convolutional code as the inner code. In order to achieve the target decoding throughput at multi-Gbps, parallel convolutional encoding has been adopted by the transmitter baseband design in both standards. It is straightforward to use parallel Viterbi decoding in the receiver baseband. However, {{it has been shown}} in [4, 5] that parallel Viterbi decoders in the receiver baseband result in massive hardware complexity and power consumption. The problem will become more severe if a higher decoding throughput is targeted (i.e., 10 Gbps) for a battery powered user terminal in the future [6]. Hence it is desirable to find a low-complexity high-throughput decoding method for convolutional codes in such systems.|$|R

40|$|As the {{spectrum}} {{is becoming more}} scarce due to exponential demand of formidable data quantities, the new millimiterwave (mmW) band is considered as an enabling player of 5 G communications to provide <b>multi-gigabits</b> wireless acccess. MmW communications exhibit high attenuation and blockage, directionality due to massive beamforming, deafness, low-interference, and may need micro waves networks for coordination and fallback support. The current mmW standardizations are challenged by the overwhelming complexity given by such heterogeneous communication systems and mmW band characteristics. This demands new substantial protocol developments at all layers. In this paper, the medium access control issues for mmW communications are reviewed.

Such systems are expected to provide data transmission rates {{in the order of}} <b>multi-gigabits</b> per second in order to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for high rate data communication. Unfortunately, 60 GHz radio is subject to severe path loss which limits its usability for long-range outdoor communication.

We provide a cumulative service process characterization for the 60 GHz outdoor propagation channel with self-interference in terms of the moment generating function (MGF) of its channel capacity. We then use this characterization to compute probabilistic upper bounds on the overall network performance, i. e., total backlog and end-to-end delay. Furthermore, we study the effect of self-interference on the network performance and propose an optimal power allocation scheme to mitigate its impact in order to enhance network performance. Finally, we investigate the relation between relay density and network performance under a total power budget constraint. We show that increasing relay density may have adverse effects on network performance unless self-interference can be kept sufficiently small...|$|R

40|$|Visible light {{communication}} (VLC) {{systems have}} become promising candidates to complement conventional radio frequency (RF) systems {{due to the}} increasingly saturated RF band and the potentially high data rates {{that can be achieved}} by VLC systems. Over the last decade, significant research effort has been directed towards the development of VLC systems due to their numerous advantages over RF systems, such as the availability of simple transmitters (light emitting diodes, LEDs) and receivers (silicon photo detectors), better security at the physical layer, improved energy efficiency due to the dual functionally (i. e., illumination and communication) and hundreds of THz of license-free bandwidth. However, there are several challenges facing VLC systems to achieve high data rates (multi gigabits per second). These challenges include the low modulation bandwidth of the LEDs, co-channel interference (CCI), inter symbol interference (ISI) due to multipath propagation and the light unit (i. e., VLC transmitter) should be ‘‘ON’’ all the time to ensure continuous communication. This thesis investigates a number of techniques to overcome these challenges to design a robust high-speed indoor VLC system with full mobility. A RGB laser diode (LD) is proposed for communication as well as illumination. The main goal of using LD is to enable the VLC system to achieve <b>multi-gigabits</b> data rates when employing a simple modulation technique (such as on-off keying (OOK)), thus adding simplicity to the VLC system. A delay adaptation technique (DAT) is proposed to reduce the delay spread and enable the system to operate at higher data rates (10 Gb/s in our case). The thesis proposes employing angle diversity receivers (ADR) and imaging diversity receivers to mitigate the impact of ISI, CCI, reduce the delay spread (increase the channel bandwidth) and increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) when the VLC system operates at high data rates (5 Gb/s and 10 Gb/s) under the effects of mobility and multipath dispersion. Moreover, the work introduces and designs three new VLC systems, an ADR relay assisted LD-VLC (ADRR-LD), an imaging relay assisted LD-VLC (IMGR-LD) and a select-the-best imaging relay assisted LD-VLC (SBIMGR-LD), which are modelled and their performance is compared at 10 Gb/s in two VLC room sizes (5 m × 5 m × 3 m and 4 m × 8 m × 3 m). As well as modelling in two different room scenarios: an empty room and a realistic environment were considered. The work also introduces and designs a high-speed fully adaptive VLC system that employs beam steering and computer generated holograms (CGHs), which has the ability to achieve 20 Gb/s with full receiver mobility in a realistic indoor environment. Furthermore, a new high-speed fast adaptive VLC system based on a divide-and-conquer methodology is proposed and integrated with the system to reduce the time required to identify the optimum hologram. The new system has the ability to achieve 25 Gb/s in the worst case scenario. This thesis also proposes four new infrared (IR) systems to support VLC systems when the light is totally turned off. In addition, it introduces the concept of a collaborative VLC/IR optical wireless (OW) system and investigates the impact of partial dimming on the VLC system performance. An adaptive rate technique (ART) is proposed to mitigate the impact of light dimming. Finally, an IROW system (cluster distributed with beam steering) is introduced to collaborate with a VLC system to maintain the target data rate in the case of partial dimming. ...|$|R
40|$|The 60 -GHz {{unlicensed}} band is a promising alternative {{to perform the}} high data rate required {{in the next generation}} of wireless communication systems. Complex modulations such as OFDM or 64 -QAM allow reaching <b>multi-gigabits</b> per second throughput over up to several tens of meters in standard CMOS technologies. This performance rely on the use of high performance millimeter-wave frequency synthesizer in the RF front-end. In this work, an original architecture is proposed to generate this high performance millimeter-wave frequency synthesizer. It is based on a high order (several tens) multiplication of a low frequency reference (few GHz), that is capable of copying the low frequency reference spectral properties. This high order frequency multiplication is performed in two steps. Firstly, a multi-harmonic signal which power is located around the harmonic of interest is generated from the low frequency reference signal. Secondly, the harmonic of interest is filtered out from this multi-harmonic signal. Both steps rely on the specific use of oscillators. This work deals with the circuit design on advanced CMOS technologies (40 nm CMOS, 55 nm BiCMOS) for the proof of concept and on the theoretical study of this system. This novel technique is experimentally validated by measurements on the fabricated circuits and exhibit state-of-the-art performance. The analytical study of this high order frequency multiplication led to the discovery of a particular kind of synchronization in oscillators and to approximated solutions of the Van der Pol equation in two different practical cases. The perspectives of this work include the design of the low frequency reference and the integration of this frequency synthesizer in a complete RF front-end architecture. La bande de fréquence non-licensée autour de 60 GHz est une alternative prometteuse pour couvrir les besoins en bande passante des futurs systèmes de communication. L'utilisation de modulations complexes (comme OFDM ou 64 -QAM) à ces fréquences permet d'atteindre, en utilisant une technologie CMOS standard, des débits de plusieurs gigabits par seconde sur quelques mètres voire quelques dizaines de mètres. Pour atteindre ces performances, la tête d'émission-réception RF (front-end RF) doit être dotée d'une référence de fréquence haute performance. Dans ce travail, une architecture originale est proposée pour générer cette référence de fréquence haute performance. Elle repose sur la multiplication de fréquence d'ordre élevé (plusieurs dizaines) d'un signal de référence basse fréquence (moins de quelques GHz), tout en recopiant les propriétés spectrales du signal basse fréquence. Cette multiplication est réalisée en combinant la production d'un signal multi-harmonique dont la puissance est concentrée autour de la fréquence à synthétiser. L'harmonique d'intérêt est ensuite extraite au moyen d'un filtrage. Ces deux étapes reposent sur l'utilisation d'oscillateurs dans des configurations spécifiques. Ce travail porte à la fois sur la mise en équation et l'étude du fonctionnement de ce système, et sur la conception de circuits dans des technologies CMOS avancées (CMOS 40 nm, BiCMOS 55 nm). Les mesures sur les circuits fabriqués permettent de valider la preuve de concept ainsi que de montrer des performances à l'état de l'art. L'étude du fonctionnement de ce système a conduit à la découverte d'une forme particulière de synchronisation des oscillateurs ainsi qu'à l'expression de solutions approchées de l'équation de Van der Pol dans deux cas pratiques particuliers.
