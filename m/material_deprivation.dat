40|$|International audienceEmpirical {{studies have}} {{recently}} pointed towards a structural position largely overlooked in social inequality research so far: the dynamic location in {{vicinity of the}} poor and yet not part of the established, more prosperous positions in society. This population fluctuates into and out of poverty more often than moving into and out of secure prosperity. It is characterized by both precariousness and prosperity, i. e. living with considerable <b>material</b> <b>deprivations,</b> yet holding opportunities for agency. Although empirically identified, this position still lacks theoretical conceptualization. To identify this in-between position of ‘precarious prosperity’ for comparative empirical research, we seek analytical elements to conceptualize it by subjecting various concepts of social inequality research to critical scrutiny. Thereafter we operationally define precarious prosperity to screen for this population in three countries. The last part of the paper presents first analysis of perceptions and ways of coping with material circumstances. These are based on qualitative interviews with selected households that underline the relevance of the concept of ‘precarious prosperity’ for the countries in question...|$|R

Methods: More than 500, 000 adults were followed for 22 years between 1982 and 2004. Tax records provided information on sex, income, marital status and postal code while a linkage {{was used to determine}} vital status. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for quintiles of neighbourhood <b>material</b> and social <b>deprivation.</b> Results: There were 180, 000 deaths over the follow-up period. In unadjusted analyses, those living in the most materially deprived neighbourhoods had elevated risks of mortality (HRmales 1. 37, 95 % CI: 1. 33 – 1. 41; HRfemales 1. 20, 95 % CI: 1. 16 – 1. 24) when compared with those living in the least deprived neighbourhoods.

50|$|In an {{alternative}} conceptualization, social exclusion theoretically emerges {{at the individual}} or group level on four correlated dimensions: insufficient access to social rights, <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> limited social participation {{and a lack of}} normative integration.

50|$|Poverty {{and social}} {{exclusion}} in Cyprus {{have not changed}} significantly following Cyprus' entry into the European Union in 2004. According to Eurostat, people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Cyprus accounted for approximately 23 - 27%, roughly aligned with the EU average of about 23 - 26% in the measured period (2004 - 2012). In 2010, 16% of the population were part of households with income below €10,189 per adult capita, corresponding to 60% of the median income per adult capita. People living in severe <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> compromised about 10% of the population.|$|E

40|$|Socioeconomic {{factors are}} one of the main {{determinants}} of health inequalities. However, which component of socioeconomic status affects health most and how that relationship should be measured remains an open question. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare <b>material</b> and social <b>deprivation</b> indexes in order to determine which better explains health inequalities within an urban area. Following a review of the literature on small area deprivation indexes, a case study of the Italian city Genoa is presented. The city of Genoa is split into 71 small areas [urbanistic units (UU) ], each of which has about 9, 500 inhabitants. For each small area, socioeconomic indicators were extracted from the 2001 Census, whereas health indicators were computed from the death registry for 2001 – 2003. Factorial analyses was used to choose the deprivation variables, which were utilised to create two distinct deprivation indexes referring to <b>material</b> and social <b>deprivation,</b> respectively. Both deprivation indexes are positively correlated with health status proxied by standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) under 65. The material index, however, correlates more highly with SMRs than the social index, and thus the material index is the more suitable measure to explain variations in premature mortality within an urban area. Moreover, the two indexes must be kept distinct...|$|R

50|$|Oscar Lewis {{introduced}} {{a theory of}} a culture of poverty in the late 1950s, initially {{in the context of}} anthropological studies in Mexico. However, the idea gained currency and influenced the Moynihan Report. This perspective argues that poverty is perpetuated by a value system different from that of mainstream society, influenced by the <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> of one's surroundings and the experiences of family and friends. There are both liberal and conservative interpretations of the culture of poverty: the former argues that lack of work and opportunities for mobility have concentrated disadvantage and left people feeling as if they have no way out of their situation; the latter believe that welfare payments and government intervention normalize and incentivize relying on welfare, not working, and having children out of wedlock, and consequently transmit social norms supporting dependency to future generations.|$|E
50|$|In later {{chapters}} {{the book}} examines the supposed lower intelligence {{of a variety}} of ethnic groups in different societies and time periods. The book claims that ethnic groups placed in a subordinate role in caste system (or caste-like system) have poor school and test performance. subordination means <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> for students, which in turn impairs their achievement; two, subordination usually involves group segregation and concentration, which, by multiplying disadvantage and drawing all group members into difficult learning situations, undercuts academic achievement; and three, subordination produces a stigmatized identity of inferiority, which in turn breeds resignation or rebellion, both of which limit academic achievement. The histories of African Americans and Latino Americans, as well as their current conditions, more than suffice to explain why their members tend to score lower than whites on tests and also why they do less well in the race for success. The American case fits the global pattern; it is not genes but caste positions that explain the apparent differences in cognitive performance.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} psychosocial {{benefits}} {{of an emergency}} education intervention serving adolescents displaced by the war in Chechnya. Interviews with 55 Chechen adolescents living in spontaneous settlements in Ingushetia, Russia were collected {{in the fall of}} 2000. The study set out to describe key stressors and sources of social support available to youth being served by the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) emergency education program. Of particular interest was {{the degree to which the}} education program addressed psychosocial goals such as increasing social support and alleviating strains including idleness, the lack of safe and structured places for youth to spend time, and concerns about lost years of schooling expressed by children and families. Findings indicated that young people and their families were facing a number of physical and emotional stressors. Regarding physical stressors, adolescents described the “living conditions” in the spontaneous settlements as the most difficult thing they faced. The physical and <b>material</b> <b>deprivations</b> experienced in the settlements were described in terms of living in an “abnormal” or “inhuman” way, including poor or crowded living conditions; infrequent supplies of food, medicines and educational materials; and concerns about parents and older adolescents being able to find work. Regarding emotional stressors, participants identified a variety of sources including loss of home, loss of time/idleness, separation from loved ones, tensions with the Ingush host community, and concerns about their ability to be productive in the future. Furthermore, a sense of humiliation linked to deprivation pervaded the experience of Chechen youth in these IDP settlements. The data indicated a number of ways in which the emergency education program provided benefits by enriching sources of support, providing meaningful activity and opportunities to learn, and a place and space for young people to spend time and connect to others. In particular, youth leaders described how the program had improved their confidence in working with others and had influenced their career goals. However, the contrast between the desire of adolescents “to live like other kids” and the options available to them presented a dilemma for the emergency education program: adolescents were craving normality, but for any intervention to be delivered, it had first to begin with creative and adaptive strategies that were by no means a complete replacement for formal, mainstream education. The programmatic and policy implications of these findings are presented in the discussion...|$|R
