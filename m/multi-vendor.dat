40|$|Abstract. Mapping and {{merging of}} {{multiple}} ontologies to produce consistent, coherent and correct merged global ontology {{is an essential}} process to enable heterogeneous <b>multi-vendors</b> semantic-based systems {{to communicate with each}} other. To generate such a global ontology automatically, the individual ontologies must be free of (all types of) errors. We have observed that the present error classification does not include all the errors. This paper extends the existing error classification (Inconsistency, Incompleteness and Redundancy) and provides a discussion about the consequences of these errors. We highlight the problems that we faced while developing our DKP-OM, ontology merging system and explain how these errors became obstacles in efficient ontology merging process. It integrates the ontological errors and design anomalies for content evaluation of ontologies under one framework. This framework helps ontologists to build semantically correct ontology free from errors that enables effective and automatic ontology mapping and merging with lesser user intervention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ontology driven {{architecture}} has {{revolutionized the}} inference system by allowing interoperability and efficient reasoning between heterogeneous <b>multi-vendors</b> systems. Sound reasoning support is highly important for sound semantic web ontologies {{which can only}} be possible if state-of-the-art Description Logic Reasoners were capable enough to identify inconsistency and classify taxonomy in ontologies. We have discussed existing ontological errors and design anomalies, and provided a case study incorporating these errors. We have evaluated consis-tency, subsumption, and satisfiability of DL reasoners on the case study. Experi-ment with DL reasoners opens up number of issues that were not incorporated within their followed algorithms. Especially circulatory errors and various types of semantic inconsistency errors that may cause serious side effects need to be de-tected by DL reasoners for sound reasoning from ontologies. The evaluation of DL reasoners on Automobile ontology helps in updating the subsumption, satisfi-ability and consistency checking algorithms for OWL ontologies, especially the new constructs of OWL 1. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{software}} defined networking (SDN) enabled by OpenFlow protocol has gained popularity which can enable the network to be programmable and accommodate both fixed and flexible bandwidth services. In this paper, {{we present a}} unified multi-layer (UML) architecture with multiple controllers and a dynamic orchestra plane (DOP) for {{software defined}} multi-domain optical networks. The proposed architecture can shield the differences among various optical devices from <b>multi-vendors</b> and the details of connecting heterogeneous networks. The cross-domain services with on-demand bandwidth can be deployed via unified interfaces provided by the dynamic orchestra plane. Additionally, the globalization strategy and practical capture of signal processing are presented based on the architecture. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture is experimentally verified on the control plane of our OpenFlow-based testbed. The performance of globalization strategy under heavy traffic load scenario is also quantitatively evaluated based on UML architecture compared with other strategies in terms of blocking probability, average hops, and average resource consumption...|$|R
