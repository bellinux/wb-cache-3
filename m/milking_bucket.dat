40|$|The {{experiment}} {{to investigate the}} effect of restricted suckling (RS) and bucket rearing (BR) involved 40 calves from crossbred dairy cows with 75 % or 87. 5 % Holstein-Friesian (HF) genes from 4 days after birth to weaning at 84 days of age. From days 4 to 84 of age restricted suckling calves were allowed to suckle their dams up to 15 minutes post <b>milking.</b> <b>Bucket</b> reared calves were fed a total of 236 kg whole milk and received concentrate supplementation after day 56. All calves were kept indoor, received Brachiaria ruziziensis grass ad libitum from day 56 and had free access to water. RS calves exhibited no losses and only 3 illnesses, whereas three BR calves died and nine developed illnesses. Up to 84 days of age RS calves had a highly significant faster average daily gain (ADG) than BR calves (620 g vrs. 390 g) and a significant larger heart-girth. RS and BR calves had an estimated adjusted daily metabolisable energy (ME) intake from milk of 18. 9 ME and 12. 6 ME and from the whole ration of 18. 9 ME and 14. 3 ME, respectively. Intake of milk fat, milk protein, Ca and P were highly significant higher in RS calves. Total protein intake from the whole ration was higher in BR calves. The daily intake of 18. 9 MJ and 14. 3 MJ ME for RS and BR calves exceeded {{the need for the}} realised ADG of 620 g and 390 g (average demand: 16. 3 and 11. 8 MJ ME) which suggest an oversupply of energy. Demand calculation for protein of 115 g and 103 g crude protein for RS and BR calves corresponded to an intake of 107. 7 g and 118. 9 g crude protein, respectively. This indicates that the efficiency in utilisation of crude protein seems to be grossly underestimated in suckling calves. Restricted suckling has been demonstrated to be an efficient method for calf rearing...|$|E
40|$|Reliability {{of quality}} of milk {{produced}} by smallholder farmers was assessed {{by means of a}} comparative analysis of the microbiological quality and somatic cell counts (SCC) of the raw milk obtained from dairy goats. Information regarding dairy goat farming and goat milk production in and around Pretoria was initially determined by means of a questionnaire. With this information, dairy goat herds were selected for the study, {{based on the fact that}} these farms produced milk for both domestic and commercial consumption. The study was conducted on three commercial dairy goat farms each under a different production system, the extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems. The method of milking varied with the type of production system; hand <b>milking,</b> <b>bucket</b> system and pipeline milking respectively. Udder health under the respective production systems was assessed by means of bacterial analysis of udder half milk samples. Bacteriology of bulk milk samples was also determined in order to assess the level of hygiene in the milking environment. In addition, water samples from the different farms were analysed for their microbial quality. Results of these parameters were compared between the different production systems using the analysis of variance. Capability of safe raw milk production by smallholder dairy goat farmers was then evaluated from the results obtained. Reliability of the SCC as a reflection of goat udder health was also evaluated. Further assessment was carried out to determine the relationship between udder conformation and presence of intra-mammary infection and SCC of the raw milk. Bacteria potentially capable of producing either food poisoning or enhanced spoilage of raw milk were cultured from the goat milk samples. These included pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis, found associated with use of milking machines as was the case in the intensive and semi-intensive production systems compared to the extensive production system. The prevalence of intramammary infection was 33. 3 %. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common cause of intramammary infection with a prevalence of 86. 6 % of the infected udder halves. They includedStaphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus intermedius. The remaining 13. 4 % of the infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus. Somatic Cell Counts were not a reflection of udder health status, hence, not reliable in the prediction of goat udder health (p = 0. 2 Fisher’s exact test of association). No significant relationship was proved to exist between the udder conformation and presence of intra-mammary infection or SCC of the milk produced. Raw milk obtained by the bucket system milking machine had the lowest total bacterial count (TBC) (16 450 Colony Forming Units per millilitre [CFU/ml]) as compared to that by pipeline milking machine (36 300 CFU/ml) or hand milking (48 000 CFU/ml). In comparison to the other two production systems, it was shown that dairy goat farming under the extensive production system, where hand milking was practised, was adequate for production of safe raw goat milk. Coliforms were found to be the most predominantly isolated organisms from the raw milk obtained under the extensive production system. However, these can be eliminated by pasteurisation of the milk. The extensive production system, therefore, could be a means to promote dairy farming in developing communities through smallholder farmers. This could be facilitated by extension services aimed at monitoring management on the farms. This would, consequently, help alleviate the problem of food security and low income in these communities.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} cheese. Cheesemaking may have originated from nomadic herdsmen who stored milk in vessels made from the sheep's and goats' stomachs. Because their stomach linings contains a mix of lactic acid, wild bacteria as milk contaminants and rennet, the milk would ferment and coagulate. Cheese, like other dairy products, “seems to bear the hallmark of pastoral nomads of Central Asia, who used animal stomach bags and untanned leather pouches as containers. Since the lining of the calf’s stomach contains the enzyme (rennin) that produces the curdling agent, rennet, milk kept in a calf’s stomach bag would turn to cheese more or less of its own accord.” [...] A product reminiscent of yogurt would have been produced, which, through gentle agitation and the separation of curds from whey would have resulted in the production of cheese; the cheese being essentially a concentration of the major milk protein, casein, and milk fat. The whey proteins, other minor milk proteins, and the lactose are all removed in the cheese whey. Another theory is offered by David Asher, who wrote that the origins actually lie within the “sloppy <b>milk</b> <b>bucket</b> in later European culture, it having gone unwashed and containing all of the necessary bacteria to facilitate the ecology of cheese.” ...|$|R

Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disk diffusion testing, and the presence of the gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour on a 291 -kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35 %. The same strain was isolated from a <b>milk</b> <b>bucket.</b> Phylogenetic analysis using 16 S rDNA, and sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the complex with similarities of 92 - 98. 8 %.

This ventilation is necessary to help draw the moisture {{up and out of}} the hay which prevents mold from growing and the hay from eventually spontaneously combusting. The next ring out is where the hay was stored. It was tossed in from an upper level. That balcony was accessible by ox-drawn wagon via a ramp outdoors. Because the barn was round the wagons could enter, unload the hay and then exit the barn without ever having to back up. The third ring out was where the Shaker brothers would walk to distribute the hay in the second ring to the cows standing in the outermost, fourth ring. The barn could hold up to 70 cows at a time. They would go to the barn twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening to be milked. Inside the barn they were put into wooden stanchions. Standing there, the cows could eat while the brothers milked them. The floor of the outermost ring is split level, with the inner part raised up 3 in. This was so that the <b>milk</b> <b>buckets</b> were not on the same level as the manure which was unsanitary. In addition to separating the milk from manure, the Shakers developed a way of both efficiently removing the manure from the complex but using it for compost. Approximately every four feet around the outermost ring, there was a trapdoor which was used to quickly scoop the manure on the floor into the trapdoor into a pit beneath the barn. Other workers would then venture to this pit in order to transport the manure to their gardens to be used as fertilizer.|$|R

The refractometer has advantages over other methods of estimating IgG concentration in that the Brix refractometer is inexpensive, readily available, less fragile, and less sensitive to variation in colostral temperature, season of the year and other factors. Samples of first-milking MC were collected from 7 dairy farms in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut (n= 84) and 1 dairy farm in California (n= 99). The MC was milked from the cow at 6. 1 ± 5. 6 h postparturition and a sample was evaluated for Brix percentage by using an optical refractometer. Two additional samples (30 mL) were collected from the <b>milk</b> <b>bucket,</b> placed in vials, and frozen before analysis of total IgG by radial immunodiffusion (RID) using commercially available plates and by turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA). The second sample was analyzed for total bacterial counts and coliform counts at laboratories in New York (Northeast samples) and California (California samples). The Brix percentage (mean ± SD) was 23. 8 ± 3. 5, IgG concentration measured by RID was 73. 4 ± 26. 2 g/L, and IgG concentration measured by TIA was 67. 5 ± 25. 0 g/L. The Brix percentage was highly correlated (r= 0. 75) with IgG analyzed by RID. The Brix percentage cut point to define high- or low-quality colostrum (50 g of IgG/L measured by RID) that classified more samples correctly given the proportion of high- (86 %) and low-quality (14 %) samples in this study was 21 %, which is slightly lower than other recent estimates of Brix measurements. At this cut point, the test sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 92. 9, 65. 5, 93. 5, 63. 3, and 88. 5 %, respectively. Measurement of IgG by TIA correlated with Brix (r= 0. 63) and RID (r= 0. 87); however, TIA and RID methods of IgG measurement were not consistent throughout the range of samples tested. We conclude that Brix measurement of total solids in fresh MC is an inexpensive, rapid, and satisfactorily accurate method of estimating IgG concentration. A cut point of 21 % Brix to estimate samples of MC > 50 g/L was most appropriate for our data. Measurement of IgG in MC by TIA differed from measurement by RID...|$|R

The aim {{of our research}} was to study how different ways of keeping (free rang and tying) and <b>milking</b> (<b>milking</b> parlour, <b>bucket</b> machine and pipeline milking) influence on the mentioned cattle characteristics. Investigation was conducted at four milking farms and 382 Holstein cows in eastern Croatia. The variance analysis has shown significant difference (P< 0, 05) among researched farms for the milk yield per milking (MYM), the somatic cell count (LSCC) and the maximum milk flowing rate (MFR). Farms at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables had more problems with udder health than farms at which milking was conducted at milking places. Also at these farms (at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables) the maximum milk flowing rate was uneven, what was caused by uneven vacuum and obsoletes milking equipment. Keeping cows free at the stable and milking at a milking place have appeared to be more appropriate for cow’s udder health, what finally influences a higher milking production. Such farms should be the future of modern milking production in Croatia. Key words: milk yield, somatic cell count, milk flowing rate, milking metho...|$|R

From these positive samples, one was considered false positive since all the animals that composed it were negative by the 2 -ME. Three of the composite milk samples that were negative to RT(3 / 37) were constituted by milk from positive animals, characterizing 8. 1 % of false-negative results by the RT. The individual RT showed high percentage of false-positive results, while the RT in samples from bucket detected 84. 2 % of the contaminated milk and 75 % of the infected herds...|$|R
40|$|An {{imported}} mobile <b>bucket</b> <b>milking</b> {{machine was}} used for milking water buffaloes. The experiment was conducted at Livestock Research Station (LRS), National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. A herd of 12 animals (water buffaloes) were milked {{for more than one}} year. Machine milking of buffaloes was the first experience of its kind in Pakistan. The results were encouraging. Type and length of stimulation phase, size of teat cup liner, suited vacuum level, weight of milking cluster, milk capacity of claw piece, way of attachment of cluster and milking with single and double clusters were included as variables. The best suited size of teat cup liner for the milked animals was 25 mm in diameter among the liners used. The 2. 1 kg cluster which was having light teat cup shells and stainless steel claw piece proved to be superior for the smooth and sponge like teats. The vacuum level 46 - 48 kPa and 44 - 46 kPa gave maximum milk yield (0. 807 and 1. 086 liters per minute) for single and double clusters, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of mother-bonded calf rearing into organic dairy farming faces some problems. Regarding the cow, the disturbed milk ejection {{seems to be}} the most important one. We compared two groups of cows, which had permanent (Kp, n= 11) or temporarily (Kt,n= 13) contact to their calves until the 90 th day p. p. with cows separated from their offspring within 24 h after calving (Ko, n= 24). Since suckling following the machine milking strongly influences milk ejection, the Kt-cows were allowed to meet their calves 15 minutes before the usual milking times (milking interval 10 : 14 hours) in a separated area. Milk flow curves were recorded at the 6 th day after calving and afterwards every fortnight at least until the 90 th day of lactation. At the same time <b>bucket</b> <b>milk</b> samples of each cow were collected. Results showed clear differences between the groups with and without calf contact. In these groups, the milk yield gained by machine milking was much lower (up to 10 kg per milking, p< 0. 001) and contained less fat (- 1...|$|R
50|$|This type of milking {{facility}} {{was the first}} development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, lean-to shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side {{and when they were}} about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and <b>milking</b> into a <b>bucket.</b> When each cow was finished she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.|$|R
40|$|Aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of three volumes monthly milk sales, months of year, types of coolers and milking systems on the freezing point of milk, fat percentage, somatic cell count (SCC) and bacterial count Total (CBT) milk come from producers that sell to a dairy of Western of Paraná. We evaluated twelve months for volume, fat, freezing point, SCC and TBC {{with a total of}} 7, 105 records. Samples for analysis were collected by milk transporters. The information was classified by monthly volume purchased from each producer (up to 4, 500 gallons between 4, 500 - 15, 000 liters and more than 15, 000 liters), by <b>milking</b> systems (manual, <b>bucket</b> foot, piped and protractor) and types of coolers (immersion, bulk and freezer) used by each producer. The milk got of producers with volumes exceeding fifteen thousand liters per month has a freezing point and fat content lesser, but have a better CBT and CCS. There were seasonal variations of freezing point, fat, CBT and CCS. Variations of CBT during periods of the year are lower in milk derived from bulk cooling and milking piped system. There are factors related to handling and cleaning of milking equipment and cooling that need to be worked with the milk producers. ...|$|R

At 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 days old, the abomasal contents of the calves were sampled at 2 -h intervals and the temperature and pH of the abomasal contents were recorded at 40 -min intervals {{for a period of}} 12 h. Rectal and abomasal temperatures of the calves were lower at 11 than at 10 days old, and were greater at 15 than at 14 days old (P< 0. 05). In a similar experiment 4 Friesian calves with ileal re-entrant cannulae were exposed to air temperatures of 25 ° from 5 to 19 days old, 5 ° from 20 to 26 days old, and 25 ° at 27 days old. At 18, 19, 20, 26 and 27 days old the ileal contents of the calves were collected and sampled for a period of 12 h.

Teat dip was either applied automatically in the treatment group (126 animals) or with a dip cub (control group; n= 137). The incidence of new IMI did not differ on a statistical significant level. In the treatment group it was 20 % and in the control group (14. 9 %, p>. 05). Incidence of new IMI caused by CNS was higher in the treatment group (6. 9 %) than in the control (3. 5 %, p The effect of postmilking teat dipping with a foaming iodophor agent regarding to IMI, incidence of clinical mastitis, SCC and the characteristics of udder tissue and teat was investigated in a further positivly controlled field study (part III). We compared two groups of animals. Teats were dipped with the new foaming iodophor in the treatment group (122 animals) while teats in the control group (121 animals) were dipped with a conventional iodophor teat dip with the same iodine content. The incidence of new IMI and clinical mastitis did not differ between the groups. We detected. 6382 cases per pro 100 days in the treatment group vs.. 5005 in the control group. The development of SCC was comparable in both groups. The teat skin an teat duct condition showed intense fluctuation during study period. In a fourth study we investigated the efficacy of premilking teat dipping with a foaming iodophor teat dip in a negative controlled field study. We used the same parameters as in part II and III to evaluate clinical efficacy of the method. Predipping was compared with a negative control using a split udder experimental design. Al teats were dipped after milking with the same dip. There was no difference between treated and control quarters in incidence of new IMI during study period (treated quarters: 6. 6 % vs. untreated: 6. 95 %), incidence of clinical mastitis (. 0575 cases per pro 100 days in the treatment group vs.. 0748 in the control group) and geometric mean of SCC of quarter milk samples.

40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of a school-based playground intervention on children’s well-being, social interactions, enjoyment {{of play and}} physical activity during lunch periods at school. MethodsOver 13 weeks moveable recycled household and garden items (e. g. tyre tubes, tarps, rope, noodles, <b>buckets,</b> <b>milk</b> crates) were made available during all play periods at one primary school. This whole-school intervention program included all staff and 135 children within years prep to six. Children were not provided with any instruction about {{how to use the}} household items. During the process evaluation, teachers (n= 9) participated in 50 minute focus groups which examined their perceptions of the program {{within the context of a}} social ecological framework considering intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational and environmental factors. ResultsThemes emerging from the focus groups suggested play within the playground was more active (exhibiting more lifting, carrying & jumping) displayed greater co-operation and engaged higher order thinking skills, negotiation and problem-solving behaviour among students. In addition, teachers discussed potential long-term changes to their school policy and physical environment within this forum. According to teachers children’s interest in the intervention was sustained over a nine month period well beyond the initial intervention delivery period of 13 weeks. ConclusionTeachers perceptions were that this inexpensive and feasible intervention program increased active, cooperative and cognitive play. This suggests that, with limited funds, the introduction of household and recycled items to a school playground has the potential to improve the policy, social and physical environments designed to promote children’s active and engaged play...|$|R
