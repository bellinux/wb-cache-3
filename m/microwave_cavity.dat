5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a <b>microwave</b> <b>cavity</b> of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The cure of the epoxy systems MY 721 / 27 % DDS at 160 C and MY 721 / 32 % DDM at 120 C {{have been}} {{investigated}} in both rectangular and cylindrical <b>microwave</b> <b>cavities</b> and thermally.

The rates of cure in the <b>microwave</b> <b>cavities,</b> estimated from both the primary and epoxy group concentrations, {{were found to be}} different, and different from the rate observed for thermal cure in a heated aluminium block. This anomalous behaviour has been attributed to spatial inhomogeneity in the temperature of the epoxy samples, arising from inhomogeneity in the microwave field in the cavity, rather than to specific absorptions of the microwave radiation by the reactive groups in the epoxy samples, as has been suggested previously by some other authors. 1...|$|R
