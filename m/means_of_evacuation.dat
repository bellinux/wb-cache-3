40|$|One <b>of</b> {{the quickest}} <b>means</b> <b>of</b> tsunami <b>evacuation</b> is {{transfer}} to higher ground soon after strong and long ground shaking. Ground shaking {{itself is a}} good initiator <b>of</b> the <b>evacuation</b> from disastrous tsunami.

We investigated the possible application of this to tsunami hazard alarm using single-site ground motion observation. Information from the mass media is sometimes unavailable due to power failure soon after a large earthquake. Even when an official alarm is available, multiple information sources of tsunami alert would help people become aware of the coming risk of a tsunami. Thus, a device that indicates risk of a tsunami without requiring other data would be helpful to those who should evacuate. Since the sensitivity of a low-cost MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer is sufficient for this purpose, tsunami alarm equipment for home use may be easily realized. Amplitude of long-period (20  s cutoff) displacement was proposed as the threshold for the alarm based on empirical relationships among magnitude, tsunami height, hypocentral distance, and peak ground displacement of seismic waves. Application of this method to recent major earthquakes indicated that such equipment could effectively alert people to the possibility of tsunami...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{evacuation}} from transport terminals in {{an emergency}} can be constrained by the complex nature of the buildings. Although emergency signage systems are widely used as a well established <b>means</b> <b>of</b> facilitating <b>evacuation,</b> recent research demonstrates that only 38 % of people 'see' conventional static emergency signage in simulated emergency situations. Besides, conventional signage only conveys single and passive information; therefore, they cannot be adapted to respond to developing evacuation situations. The EU FP 7 GETWAY project addresses this problem for transport terminals {{through the development of}} an Intelligent Active Dynamic Signage System (IADSS), which routes terminal passengers to their optimal exit according to the distribution of occupants {{and the nature of the}} evolving incident. This paper presents the results of two full scale evacuation trials conducted in a rail station to establish the specific benefits of the Active Dynamic Signage System (i. e. ADSS, a subsystem of the IADSS without the intelligent component) over the current standard emergency signage system. These trials demonstrate that the flashing lights of the ADSS do have a greater effect on route choice compared to the standard signage system and therefore are more likely to promote the adoption <b>of</b> emergency <b>evacuation</b> procedures than would otherwise be the case, especially where evacuees are required to adopt routes not entirely based on proximity...|$|R

Should slide inflation fail, there is a manual inflation handle within the door frame of each exit (the location of which varies but is always indicated on the safety information card) which can be pulled to inflate the slide. Should this also fail exit and sliding down the extend flaps on the rear of the wing is possible.|$|E

40|$|Hazards in {{offshore}} operation, such as gas leak, explosions, fires, collisions and icebergs, {{could result}} in emergencies that necessitate abandon of the platform. These emergencies could arise in calm water, during a storm or in pack ice. Therefore, evacuation system performance must be assessed {{in a wide range}} of weather conditions in wind, waves and ice. The focus in this report is lifeboat performance in pack ice. Lifeboats are often used as one of the secondary <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evacuation.</b> In the east coast ofCanada and in different parts of the world, broken ice is a common occurrence. Pack icecan surround an offshore platform or a vessel. If abandonment of a platform or a vessel iswarranted, then the lifeboat may need to be able to travel through ice to a safe areabeyond the hazardous area boundary to escape dangers such as toxic fumes and smoke. There are many factors that affect TEMPSC performance in ice, including iceconcentration, ice thickness, ice strength, ice floe size etc. The speed and navigability ofthe craft are expected to deteriorate with worsened ice conditions. It is important in the evaluation of evacuation systems and in the preparation of anemergency preparedness plan that these factors are taken into account. Therefore, it isessential to investigate how lifeboat performance can be limited by different iceconditions.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of measures on reduction of population radiation exposure at the radioactively contaminated territories by comparing radiation doses due to natural and technogenic sources. Materials and methods: the effective doses of radiation exposure due to the Techa River contamination in Muslyumovo were calculated using the data on radionuclide intakes and coefficients recommended by ICRP. Exposure to radon was estimated based on the results of radon surveys of Muslyumovo in 1992 and New Muslyumovo in 2015. Results: the total effective dose due to the Techa River contamination accumulated over the period 1950 – 2000 was 144 mSv. Annual effective doses due to radon in Muslyumovo and New Muslyumovo were 9, 2 and 5, 1 mSv respectively. The total effective dose received due to the natural and technogenic radiation was about 0, 7 Sv (a contribution of radon is 77 %).

40|$|IMPORTANCE Infantile colic, {{gastroesophageal}} reflux, and constipation are {{the most}} common functional gastrointestinal disorders that lead to referral to a pediatrician during the first 6 months of life and are often responsible for hospitalization, feeding changes, use of drugs, parental anxiety, and loss of parental working days with relevant social consequences. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether oral supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 during the first 3 months of life can reduce the onset of colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation in term newborns and thereby reduce the socioeconomic impact of these conditions. DESIGN A prospective, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was performed on term newborns (age < 1 week) born at 9 different neonatal units in Italy between September 1, 2010, and October 30, 2012. SETTING Parents were asked to record in a structured diary the number of episodes of regurgitation, duration of inconsolable crying (minutes per day), number <b>of</b> <b>evacuations</b> per day, number of visits to pediatricians, feeding changes, hospitalizations, visits to a pediatric emergency department for a perceived health emergency, pharmacologic interventions, and loss of parental working days. PARTICIPANTS In total, 589 infants were randomly allocated to receive L reuteri DSM 17938 or placebo daily for 90 days. INTERVENTIONS Prophylactic use of probiotic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reduction of daily crying time, regurgitation, and constipation during the first 3 months of life. Cost-benefit analysis of the probiotic supplementation. RESULTS At 3 months <b>of</b> age, the <b>mean</b> duration <b>of</b> crying time (38 vs 71 minutes; P <. 01), the <b>mean</b> number <b>of</b> regurgitations per day (2. 9 vs 4. 6; P <. 01), and the <b>mean</b> number <b>of</b> <b>evacuations</b> per day (4. 2 vs 3. 6; P <. 01) for the L reuteri DSM 17938 and placebo groups, respectively, were significantly different.
