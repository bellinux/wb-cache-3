Multiple formulas were prepared using 100 mg of ciprofloxacin HCl, 700 mg of phospahtidylcholine with different concentrations of cholesterol (10, 20, 30 and 40 mg). Formulas contain 20 and 30 mg of cholesterol were selected to study the effect of sodium deoxycholate. Rotary evaporator and bath sonication methods were utilized to prepare liposomes. Liposomes properties as entrapment efficiency, vesicles size, relative deformability (elasticity) and pH were studied.

40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with gall stones who were taking chenodeoxycholic acid(CDCA) 15 mg/kg at bedtime participated {{in two separate}} experiments to investigate the effects of altering sterol intake on the cholesterol saturation index (SI) of fasting gall-bladder bile. In experiment I the 15 patients on an unrestricted diet had a SI of 0. 87 +/- 0. 04 (mean +/- SE of mean), which fell to 0. 75 +/- 0. 04 after one week in hospital on a diet of 100 <b>mg</b> <b>cholesterol</b> daily. In experiment II seven of the patients were given four different dietary regimens lasting one month each in random order as outpatients. On a diet of 600 mg of cholesterol daily the mean SI was 0. 72 +/- 0. 05, which fell to 0. 67 +/- 0. 05 when the patients were put on a 100 <b>mg</b> <b>cholesterol</b> diet. The addition of plant sterols (3 g daily) to both diets raised the mean SIs to 0. 80 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 77 +/- 0. 05 respectively.

40|$|Lutein plays a {{significant}} role in age-related macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Previous research, however, has not evaluated the effects of lutein on risk factors of both conditions concomitantly.

Baseline serum lutein positively associated with HDL-C concentrations (r = 0. 43, P = 0. 02). Macular pigment (MP) density positively correlated with TC (r = 0. 40, P = 0. 02), LDL-C (r = 0. 39, P = 0. 02) and HDL particle size (r = 0. 50, P = 0. 003) and inversely with small HDL (r = - 0. 47, p = 0. 006) and small LDL (r = - 0. 38, P = 0. 047) particles number. LDL and HDL subfraction profiles {{may play a role in}} the transport of lutein from serum to retina. Serum lutein concentrations increased significantly from baseline (P = 0. 009) and MP density improved (P = 0. 07) in egg groups. Following egg consumption, HDL particle size significantly increased (P = 0. 03), while total VLDL (P = 0. 003) and small VLDL (P = 0. 008) decreased. Total LDL particles number also tended to decrease (P = 0. 07). Changes in HDL particle size was positively associated with changes in serum HDL-C concentration (r = 0. 55, P= 0. 003). Changes in apB concentrations were inversely related to changes in total LDL particles number (rho = 0. 47, P = 0. 003). Intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 (sICAM- 1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1), and C- reactive protein (CRP) concentrations decreased in the egg group (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Changes in serum sICAM- 1 tended to inversely correlate with changes in HDL-C concentrations (rho = - 0. 33, P = 0. 07).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{cholesterol}} {{content of}} infertile and fertile eggs from White Leghorn hens was compared. In Trials 1 and 2, infertile eggs were collected, a male was introduced, and fertile eggs then {{collected from the}} same hens. In Trial 3, two pens of hens were trapnested. The first pen contained hens only, and the second pen contained hens plus a male. After the desired number of eggs were collected from each hen, the male {{was moved to the}} other pen. Twenty-one days were allowed to elapse and eggs were again collected. In Trial 1, there were no statistically significant differences between fertile and infertile eggs in wet yolk weight, dry yolk weight, <b>mg.</b> <b>cholesterol</b> per g. dry yolk, or total yolk cholesterol.

After 4 weeks on either diet, the mothers then crossed over to the other for a 2 nd 4 -week period. Breast milk constituted the infants ’ sole intake during the two periods. On the polyunsaturate-rich diet, milk content of linoheic acid (18 : 2) was more than doubled, while the levels of palmitoleic (16 : 1), stearic (18 : 0), palmitic (16 : 0), and myristic (14 : 0) fatty acids were all reduced. The fatty acid pattern in milk for the ad libitum dietary period was qualitatively very similar to that for the saturate-rich period. Comparing the polyunsaturate-rich to the saturate-rich maternal diet periods, infant plasma linoheate rose and oheate fell on the pohyunsaturate-rich diet. There were very chose and significant relationships between maternal milk and infant plasma 16 : 0, 16 : 1, 18 : 2, and 20 : 3 fatty acids.

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} perform food surveys and {{prescribe}} diets, food composition tables {{have to be}} consulted.

Objectives: Based on data derived from an extensive analysis of the chemical composition of Brazilian foods, we assessed the impact of certain types of foods on diets recommended {{for the prevention of}} coronary disease. Methods: The fatty acid and cholesterol composition of some types of foods and different preparation methods were analyzed. These results were used according to the recommendations of the American Heart Association for an 1, 800 calorie diet. Results: Cholesterol found in 100 g of eggs (400 mg) or fried beef liver (453 mg) exceeds the amount recommended for secondary prevention, and there is no difference in cholesterol content between factory-farmed eggs and free-range eggs. The eggs had an average of 400 <b>mg</b> of <b>cholesterol</b> per 100 g, thus exceeding the recommended amount of up to 300 mg.
