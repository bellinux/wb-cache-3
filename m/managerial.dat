5|$|Lajoie {{finished}} the season tied for third-most in hits (168) while Cobb's batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and hit total led the American League. Baseball historians have suggested the <b>managerial</b> duties Lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the game, a group of former Team Bondi {{employees}} launched a website called lanoirecredits.com, containing over 100 names which had been excluded or incorrectly listed in the official game credits. This was later followed by a series of claims and counter-claims about working hours and company <b>managerial</b> style during the game's development. Anonymous members of the development team publicly discussed the <b>managerial</b> style of the studio, the studio's staff turnover rates and the working hours and conditions associated with L.A. Noire.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Port Vale {{chairman}} Norman Smurthwaite {{revealed that}} he had rejected Hasselbaink for the vacant <b>managerial</b> position at his club in 2014, {{out of fear that}} racist elements of their support would abuse him.|$|E

In his final <b>managerial</b> year, Burns coached Portland, Maine of the New England League.|$|E
5|$|After the 1932 season, the Cardinals traded Bottomley to the Cincinnati Reds for Ownie Carroll and Estel Crabtree, in {{an attempt}} to partner Bottomley with Chick Hafey in {{developing}} a more potent offensive attack.

5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} <b>managerial</b> attitude as did {{the rest of the}} American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the standard by which progress was measured. Sortie rates and the number of bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one <b>managerial</b> position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E
5|$|Angel's was {{the first}} Israeli bakery to go public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, in 1984. However, it remains a family business.

Ovadia passed down the directorship of production and technology to his son Gadi. Danny handed over the company directorship to his son Yaron.|$|E
5|$|Below {{these are}} the members of UK Headquarters, {{including}} the association's Chief Scout, who is honorary head of the association and its public face, and the UK Chief Commissioner, {{who is in charge}} of the volunteers in the association and of the other commissioners. Below {{these are the}} commissioners for the nations, regions, counties, areas and districts, all of whom are assisted by deputies and assistant commissioners who can oversee and advise on a particular area of responsibility – for example an assistant district commissioner for Beaver Scouts particularly ensures that that section in the district is abiding to the association's rules. The final <b>managerial</b> role in the association is that of the Group Scout Leader and their assistant, who are both in charge of a local Scout group. All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion and advanced <b>managerial</b> skills to achieve their Wood Badge.|$|E
5|$|Bruce was {{dismissed}} as manager on 30 November 2011, with Sunderland in 16th position following a poor run of form which culminated with a 2–1 home defeat to bottom club Wigan four days earlier.

5|$|Even without <b>managerial</b> manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers {{would be able to}} fulfill their output expectations; in {{industries}} such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Evers {{remained}} a {{coach for the}} Braves under Bill McKechnie, who succeeded Fuchs as field manager in 1930, and served in the role through 1932.

The White Sox replaced Evers with Collins after the season.|$|E
5|$|Ferens was industrious and forward-thinking; {{he moved}} swiftly through the company's <b>managerial</b> ranks. In 1874 he became works manager with {{a share in}} profits; in 1879, secretary; in 1880, general manager. He joined the board of {{directors}} in 1888 when Reckitt and Sons became a private joint-stock company. When James Reckitt died, 36 years later, Ferens was named joint chairman.|$|E
5|$|First team coach Tony Mowbray was {{in charge}} for four games as {{caretaker}} manager, winning once, but he was replaced as manager by the permanent appointment of former Oldham Athletic, Everton and Manchester City manager Joe Royle, whose <b>managerial</b> career had previously yielded four promotions and one FA Cup victory; as a player, he had been named {{player of the year}} in his only full season at Ipswich's local rivals Norwich City.|$|E

5|$|From 1943 to 1989, no <b>managerial</b> term lasted {{as long as}} five {{complete}} seasons. The Braves were {{managed by}} Billy Southworth from 1946 to 1949, and again from 1950 to 1951. Southworth led the team into the 1948 World Series, which ended the Braves' 34-year postseason drought; the World Series ended in a losing result for the Braves. In 1953, the team moved from Boston to Milwaukee, where it {{was known as the}} Milwaukee Braves. Its first manager in Milwaukee was Charlie Grimm, who managed the team from mid-season of 1952 to mid-season of 1956.

When he reached a <b>managerial</b> position at the dealership, he recruited his salesmen to bring him reports on archaeological sites and collections.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012 Estianty {{announced}} that, although Duo Maia {{would continue}} to perform, she intended to focus on {{her work as a}} producer; she had spent the previous several months focusing on her <b>managerial</b> duties at Le Moesik. Meanwhile, Chan would begin a solo career.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Birmingham's board agreed a new {{contract}} for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club's prospective purchaser Carson Yeung to ratify it left his future uncertain.

5|$|Major League Baseball was {{developed}} by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on <b>managerial</b> details, which {{stressed the importance of}} choosing a well-balanced team. Despite its graphical limitations, it was considered a three-dimensional game at the time and was featured in the first issue of Nintendo Power as compared the system's other baseball games of the era.|$|E
5|$|Managers in the Premier League are {{involved}} in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a <b>managerial</b> departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent <b>managerial</b> post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Martinez {{became the}} bench {{coach for the}} Rays in 2008. Since then he has been {{considered}} a candidate for several <b>managerial</b> positions in MLB.
