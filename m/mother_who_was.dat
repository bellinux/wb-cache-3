40|$|Based on {{attachment}} {{theory and}} recent findings with adults on relations between narrative coherence and well-being, {{we hypothesized that}} <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more securely attached and who cope more effectively would be more engaged and more emotionally expressive in mother-child co-constructed narratives about stressful events. Twenty-seven mostly white mixed-SES mothers and their 9 - to 12 -year-old children with asthma were asked to discuss two asthmaspecific stressful events together: a chronic parent-child conflict and an acute asthma attack. Few relations emerged for the asthma attack event, although, against predictions, <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> more anxiously attached were more engaged and more explanatory in these narratives than <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> less anxiously attached. For the conflict event, <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> more anxiously attached talked more about other people’s emotions than did <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> less anxiously attached, and <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> cope more effectively were more engaged, more emotionally expressive, and more explanatory, and, in turn, their children showed more flexible coping...|$|R

5|$|Adams {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of becoming {{a free agent after}} the 2007 season, but he resigned with the Roughriders by February 2008. Adams was challenged by Brent Curvey and Ronald Flemons in training camp, but he won the starting role for the 2008 season. Playing in 14 games, he made 11 tackles and two fumble recoveries. Adams missed a regular season game in July to visit his <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> undergoing cancer surgery, and he also spent time on the injured list due to a finger injury and sprained ankle. The Roughriders made the playoffs, but lost to the BC Lions 33–12 in the West Semi-Final.|$|E

Letters described beatings Chen {{and his wife}} were subjected to, seizure of documents and communication devices, cutting off of electric power to their residence, and placing of metal sheets over the windows of their house. Harassment of Chen's family continued throughout his house arrest, and extended to Chen's six-year-old daughter, who was briefly banned from attending school and had her toys confiscated by guards, and to Chen's <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> harassed while working in the fields. Authorities reportedly told Chen that they had spent 60 million yuan ($9.5 million) to keep him under house arrest.|$|E

Lawler, however, was married at the time, and he claims that when he initially met Carter, he considered an affair. After Lawler separated from his wife, Carter moved in with him. When Carter first met Lawler, she was working as a bank teller. Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio, and she also opened and ran her own hair salon.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish {{advance on}} London {{appears to have}} been coordinated with the {{movement}} of the rebels in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Their forces were armed with weapons including sticks, battle axes, old swords and bows. Along their way, they encountered Lady Joan, the King's <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> travelling back to the capital to avoid being caught up in the revolt; she was mocked but otherwise left unharmed. The Kentish rebels reached Blackheath, just south-east of the capital, on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} been outside Salic laws. The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's <b>mother</b> (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Although Clement {{spent only}} six years {{serving as an}} umpire on a regular basis, she {{continued}} to serve intermittently until her forties. Following her time as a regularly serving umpire, Amanda Clement spent several years teaching physical education at the University of Wyoming, the Jamestown, North Dakota high school, and other schools in North Dakota and South Dakota. Clement also managed several Y.W.C.A.s, including one in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Clement also served as the coach of Hudson Independent basketball team, organized tennis tournaments, {{and served as a}} newspaper reporter, police matron, typesetter, justice of the peace, and as the city assessor for the town of Hudson. In 1929 Clement moved back to South Dakota to care for her <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> ill. Following her mother's death in 1934, Clement moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota where she spent twenty-five years as a social worker before retiring in 1966. Clement died in Sioux Falls on July 20, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She tried to find a job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant that people were unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because that job did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she had to lie to her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E

5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians {{who participated in the}} war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Duchess of York's Catholic secretary, Edward Colman, was, in 1678, falsely {{implicated in}} a fictitious plot against the King by Titus Oates. The plot, {{known as the}} Popish Plot, led to the Exclusionist movement, which was headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The Exclusionists sought to debar the Catholic Duke of York from the throne. Their {{reputation}} in tatters, the Yorks were reluctantly exiled to Brussels, a domain of the King of Spain, ostensibly to visit Lady Mary—since 1677 the wife of Prince William III of Orange. Accompanied by her not yet three-year-old daughter Isabella and Lady Anne, the Duchess of York was saddened by James's extra-marital affair with Catherine Sedley. Mary's spirits were briefly revived by a visit from her <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> living in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A popular legend imbues {{the birth}} of Ralambo with a mystical character. The legend relates that his <b>mother,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> known in her youth as Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest"), was the {{daughter}} of the Vazimba water goddess Ivorombe ("Great Bird"). With the assistance of her celestial mother, Ramaitsoanala confronted and overcame numerous obstacles. After her marriage to Andriamanelo (whereupon she assumed the name Queen Randapavola), one of these obstacles took the form of reproductive difficulties: six consecutive times Randapavola miscarried or lost her children in infancy. When she was pregnant with her seventh child, the queen was especially afraid for her unborn child because the number seven was traditionally associated with death. This time, Randapavola sought the guidance of an astrologer to protect the unborn child from an evil fate. On his advice she chose to defy the tradition of delivering the baby at her parents' home village of Ambohidrabiby, rather choosing the village of Alasora, to the north of Antananarivo, because this cardinal direction embodied great power. According to the tale, the queen gave birth in a house built to resemble a boat (called a kisambosambo) evocative of the transoceanic origins of the Malagasy people. There, Randapavola took the name Rasolobe upon delivering a healthy son, Ralambo, {{on the first day of}} the first month of the year (Alahamady), the most auspicious date for {{the birth of}} a sovereign.|$|E
