40|$|Among {{the many}} {{potential}} applications of carbon nanotubes (CNT), its usage to strengthen polymers {{has been paid}} considerable attention due to the exceptional stiffness, excellent strength, and the low density of CNT. This has provided numerous opportunities for the invention of new material systems for applications requiring high strength and high modulus. Precise control over processing factors, including preserving intact CNT structure, uniform dispersion of CNT within the polymer matrix, effective filler–matrix interfacial interactions, and alignment/orientation of polymer chains/CNT, contribute to the composite fibers’ superior properties. For this reason, fabrication methods {{play an important role}} in determining the composite fibers’ microstructure and ultimate mechanical behavior. The current state-of-the-art polymer/CNT high-performance composite fibers, especially in regards to processing–structure–performance, are reviewed in this contribution.

Deep penetration, defect-free, and oxygen contamination free welds were achieved under an optimum combination of laser parameters including focal length of lens, pulse energy, pulse repetition rate, beam travel speed, and an innovative shielding gas arrangement. The key for defect-free welds was found to be the stabilization of the keyhole and providing an escape path for the gas trapped in the molten weld pool.

Research on 2 D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH) {{has so far been}} focused on fabricating individually stacked atomically thin unary or binary crystals. Such systems include graphene (Gr), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family. Here we present our experimental study of the opto-electronic properties of a naturally occurring vdWH, known as Franckeite, which is a complex layered crystal composed of lead, tin, antimony, iron and sulfur. We present here that thin film franckeite (60 nm < d < 100 nm) behave as narrow band gap semiconductor demonstrating a wide band photoresponse. We have observed the band-edge transition at ~ 1500 nm (~ 830 meV) and high external quantum efficiency (EQE~ 3 %) at room temperature. Laser power resolved and temperature resolved photocurrent measurements reveal that the photo-carrier generation and recombination are dominated by continuously distributed trap states within the band gap. To understand wavelength resolved photocurrent, we also calculated the optical absorption properties via density functional theory. Finally, we have shown that the device has fast photoresponse with rise time as fast as ~ 1 ms. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the optoelectronic behavior in a complex naturally occurring vdWH and can open up the possibilities of producing new type of nanoscale optoelectronic devices with tailored properties.

40|$|Materials {{with high}} carrier {{mobility}} showing large magnetoresistance (MR) have recently received much attention because of potential applications in future high-performance magnetoelectric devices. Here, we report on an electron-hole-compensated half-Heusler semimetal LuPtBi that exhibits an extremely high electron mobility of up to 79000 cm 2 /Vs with a nonsaturating positive MR as large as 3200 % at 2 K. Remarkably, the mobility at 300 K is found to exceed 10500 cm 2 /Vs, which is among the highest values reported in three-dimensional bulk materials thus far. The clean Shubnikov–de Haas quantum oscillation observed at low temperatures and the first-principles calculations together indicate that the high electron mobility {{is due to a}} rather small effective carrier mass caused by the distinctive band structure of the crystal.

40|$|Metamaterials are {{composed}} of structural elements and derive their properties mainly from the inner structure of the elements, rather than {{the properties of the}}ir constituent <b>material.</b> <b>By</b> <b>designing</b> an unstable structural element as the building block of a metamaterial, many interesting effective material properties can be obtained. The deformation and dissipation mechanisms of such a material built from unstable structural elements is studied in detail. To do so a combination of analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical models are applied to a single buckling element, a periodic cell, and finite size combinations of buckling elements including gradients in the properties of the building blocks. This not only provides insight into the micromechanics and the resulting effective behavior of such metamaterials, but also makes them accessible on the different relevant length scales.

40|$|The {{rationale}} underlying <b>materials</b> <b>by</b> <b>design</b> is that {{properties are}} determined by structure so that if the relationships between structure and properties are understood, an appropriate material can be designed and fabricated to meet any set of criteria. Since ion-ion potentials determine state transformations and reactivity, they {{are essential to the}} entire concept of <b>materials</b> and molecules <b>by</b> <b>design.</b> Virtually all of the important state-to-state processes undergone by molecules (excitation, relaxation, ionization, dissociation, and combination) and the selection among these different pathways {{are determined by}} the ion-ion potentials and the resulting degree of overlap between molecular vibrational states for different electronic and atomic configurations. Although the depths of these potentials can be obtained from thermodynamic data and the separations between the vibronic states from spectroscopic measurements, the use of these potentials in the ab initio calculation of state-transformation outcomes is limited by the absence of any direct method for determining their extent and shape.

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{increase}} the superconducting transition temperature Tc of strongly correlated <b>materials</b> <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> heterostructures which exhibit a high pairing energy {{as a result of}} magnetic fluctuations. More precisely, applying an effective theory of the doped Mott insulator, we envisage a bilayer Hubbard system where both layers exhibit prominent intralayer (intraband) d-wave superconducting correlations. Introducing a finite asymmetry between the hole densities of the two layers such that one layer becomes slightly more underdoped and the other more overdoped, we evidence a visible enhancement of Tc compared to the optimally doped isolated layer. Using the bonding and antibonding band basis, we show that the mechanism behind this enhancement of Tc is the interband pairing correlation mediated by the hole asymmetry which strives to decrease the paramagnetic nodal contribution to the superfluid stiffness. For two identical layers, Tc remains comparable to that of the isolated layer until moderate values of the interlayer single-particle tunneling term. These heterostructures shed new light on fundamental questions related to superconductivity. Comment: Final Version, to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of condensed matter physics is <b>materials</b> <b>by</b> <b>design,</b> i. e. the ability to reliably predict and design materials with a set of desired properties. A striking example is the deterministic enhancement of the superconducting properties of materials. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the metamaterial approach is capable of achieving this goal, such as tripling the critical temperature Tc in Al-Al 2 O 3 epsilon near zero (ENZ) core-shell metamaterial superconductors. However, transport properties of such metamaterials remained much worse compared to conventional superconductors. Here, we demonstrate that an Al/Al 2 O 3 hyperbolic metamaterial geometry is capable of a similar Tc enhancement, while having superior transport and magnetic properties compared to the core-shell metamaterial superconductors. This result opens up numerous new possibilities for metamaterial enhancement of Tc in other practically important simple superconductors, such as niobium and MgB 2. It also indicates that the recently discovered hyperbolic properties of high Tc superconductors may play considerable role in superconductivity enhancement in cuprates.
