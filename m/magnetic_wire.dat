25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>wire</b> recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape sound recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders. Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the circumstances underlying recent reports of very large values of ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR) in nanocontacts between <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires.</b> We find that the geometries used are subject to artifacts due to motion of the wires that distort the nanocontact thereby changing its electrical resistance.

30|$|Here, we {{presented}} complete experimental details and {{results of the}} electrostatic complexation between cationic homoPEs and negatively charged superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. By using direct mixing method, we evidenced their ‘destabilization state’ at charges stoichiometry (isoelectric point) and ‘long-lived stable clusters state’ named arrested states apart of isoelectric point. Then, we applied the ‘desalting kinetic’ method to their complexation {{in the presence of}} an externally applied magnetic field (0.3 T). At isoelectric point, large and irregular aggregates with macroscopic sedimentation were obtained. Apart of isoelectric point (at arrested state), regular and elongated <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> can be obtained. By tuning charges ratio, we can also select the overall surface charge (either positive or negative) of these <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires.</b> Moreover, we derive the probability distribution function of wire length and study their mechanisms of reorientations under the application of a magnetic field. The experimental observations lead us {{to the conclusion that the}} wires formed with homoPEs are superparamagnetic as well as the wires made from polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers.|$|R

40|$|Surface defect is {{regarded}} as one critical factor that affects magnetic properties of magnetic microwires. However, current imaging techniques only allow to observe samples from one fixed direction, and thereby most of surface defects on microwire cannot be detected. Herein, we firstly develop a miniature rotatable robot inside scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and propose a relevant control strategy to align the microwire onto the rotation axis of the robot. After that, the microwire is rotated continuously by 360 o and all the surface defects on the microwire are observed from different directions successfully. Multidirectional observation results {{can be used to}} located heating inhomogeneity, which is the main cause of defects. Magnetic measurement results show that the effect of defects on domain wall (DW) should be considered in device design.

30|$|We then {{investigated}} the dialysis of these salted dispersions of under an {{external magnetic field}} (B[*]=[*] 0.3 T) {{in order to produce}} one-dimensional <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires.</b> At isoelectric point, we obtained large aggregates of 100 μm with irregular morphologies, indicating the strong attractive interaction between homoPEs with charged NPs and their uncontrolled complexation. At Z[*]=[*] 0.3 and Z[*]=[*] 7, the straight and regular <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> were obtained, indicating that the extra polymer or particle charges can soften their strong attractive interaction. These wires can be either positively (obtained at Z[*]=[*] 0.3) or negatively (obtained at Z[*]=[*] 7) charged on surface. These homoPEs formed wires, as the wires made from PTEA 11 K-b- PAM 30 K copolymers, were rigid aggregates with superparamagnetic properties inherited from the single particles. We thus have shown that the previous copolymer-based co-assembly strategy could be generalized to strong and weak polyelectrolytes. In terms of cost and practicality, this represents a remarkable improvement. Beyond, the evident surface charges induced by the amine or carboxyl functions can not only enhance their colloidal stability but also facilitate their future functionalization. This simple and general approach opens significant perspectives for the design of multifunctional hybrid materials.|$|R

40|$|The magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} of thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> of {{iron and}} cobalt {{is quite different from}} the bulk phases. The spin moment of monatomic Fe wire may be as high as 3. 4 μB, while the orbital moment as high as 0. 5 μB. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) was calculated for wires up to 0. 6 nm in diameter starting from monatomic wire and adding consecutive shells for thicker wires. I observe that Fe wires exhibit the change sign with the stress applied along the wire. It means that easy axis may change from the direction along the wire to perpendicular to the wire. We find that ballistic conductance of the wire depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field, i. e. shows anisotropic ballistic magnetoresistance. This effect occurs due to the symmetry dependence of the splitting of degenerate bands in the applied field which changes the number of bands crossing the Fermi level. We find that the ballistic conductance changes with applied stress. Even for thicker wires the ballistic conductance changes by factor 2 on moderate tensile stain in our 5 × 4 model wire. Thus, the ballistic conductance of <b>magnetic</b> <b>wires</b> changes in the applied field due to the magnetostriction. This effect can be observed as large anisotropic BMR in the experiment...|$|R
