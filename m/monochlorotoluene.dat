40|$|V-Mo-O/SiO 2 {{materials}} were {{prepared by the}} impregnation techniques and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), FT-IR, Thermal analysis, N 2 adsorption/desorption and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to determine the phase structure and loadings of vanadium species. This material was tested for solvent-free catalytic oxidation of <b>monochlorotoluene</b> under chosen conditions. The result shows that V-Mo-O/SiO 2 is effective catalysts, exhibiting conversion of <b>monochlorotoluene</b> and selectivity monochloromaleic anhydride 75 – 85 %, 24 – 32 % respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused for 20 - 25 hours without a significant loss in its activity and selectivity. The oxidation rate and direction determined by the temperature (315 - 4500 C), proportions between the reagents (1 : 1 – 1 : 15 mol/l), bond dissociation energies, the effects of active components of catalyst and contact time...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{preparation}} of <b>monochlorotoluenes</b> from toluene using divided/undivided electrochemical reactors in aqueous hydrochloric acid {{has been investigated}} under different experimental conditions to maximize the product yield. The process conditions were optimized and a detailed material balance has been worked out. Scale-up from laboratory cell to a large scale cell clearly demonstrates the technical feasibility of this proces...|$|R
