A quantitative questionnaire has been developed out of theories and qualitative pilot-studies.   Conclusion: This research can conclude that <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> retailers on the Swedish market have, in average, implemented 5 e-CRM features per company. This equals a 12 % usage of the total e-CRM features explored for this research. The one proved factor that can describe how retailers have adopted e-CRM is their profitability rate. Companies with a profitability rate below market average are more likely to have implemented more e-CRM features than companies with higher profit rate than market average. The explanation to this might be that companies with a low profit rate implement e-CRM as a tool to cure their low profit rate, since e-CRM is supposed to bring benefits as lower costs and increased sales with the purpose to increase their profit in the future.   Key words; e-CRM, growth orientation, <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> companies, retailer...|$|R

40|$|Cement based {{composites}} i. e. paste, {{mortar and}} concrete {{are the most}} utilized materials {{in the construction industry}} all over the world. Cement composites are quasi-brittle in nature and possess extremely low tensile strength as compared to their compressive strength. Due to their low tensile strength capacity, cracks develop in cementitious composites due to the drying shrinkage, plastic settlements and/or stress concentrations (due to external restrains and/or applied stresses) etc. These cracks developed at the nanoscale may grow rapidly due to the applied stresses and join together to form micro and macro cracks. The growth of cracks from nanoscale to micro and macro scale is very rapid and may lead to sudden failure of the cement composites. Therefore, it is necessary to develop such types of cement composites possessing higher resistance to crack growth, enhanced flexural strength and ductility. The development of new technologies and materials has revolutionized every field of science by opening new horizons in production and manufacturing. In construction materials, especially in cement and concrete composites, the use of nano/micro particles and fibers in the mix design of these composites has opened new ways from improved mechanical properties to enhanced functionalities. Generally, the production or manufacturing processes of the nano/micro sized particles and fibers are energy intensive and expensive. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} explore new methods and procedures to develop less energy intensive, low cost and eco-friendly inert nano/micro sized particles for utilization in the cement composites to obtain better performance in terms of strength and ductility. The main theme of the present research work was to develop a family of new type of cementitious composites possessing superior performance characteristics in terms of strength, ductility, fracture energy and crack growth pattern by incorporating <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles in the mix design of cementitious composites. To achieve these objectives the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles were prepared from organic waste materials, namely: Bamboo, coconut shell and hemp hurds. For comparison purposes and performance optimization needs, another inorganic waste material named as carbon soot was also investigated in the present research. The experimental investigations for the present study was carried out in two phases; In the first phase of research work, a methodology was developed for the synthesis of the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles from the above mentioned organic raw materials. In the second phase of research, various mix proportions of the cementitious composites were prepared incorporating the synthesized <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles. For <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles obtained from bamboo and coconut shell three wt. % additions i. e. 0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 20 were investigated and for particles synthesized from hemp hurds 0. 08, 0. 20, 1. 00 and 3. 00 wt. % additions were explored. The cement composites were characterized by third-point bending tests and their fracture parameters were evaluated. The mechanical characterization of specimens suggested that 0. 08 wt. % addition of <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized bamboo particles enhances the flexural strength and toughness of cement composites up to 66 % and 103 % respectively. The toughness indices I 5, I 10 and total toughness of the cement composites were also enhanced. The carbonized particles synthesized from coconut shell resulted in improved toughness and ductility without any increase in the modulus of rupture of the cement composite specimens. Maximum enhancements in I 5 and I 10 were observed for 0. 08 % addition of both carbonized and carbonized-annealed particles. For the carbonized hemp hurds cement composites the results indicate that the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles additions enhanced the flexural strength, compressive strength and the fracture energy of the cement composites. The microstructure of the cement composites was also studied with the help of field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) by observing small chunks of cement composite paste samples. The FESEM observations indicated that the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles utilized in the mix design of these mixes were well dispersed in the cement matrix. It was also observed that the fracture paths followed by the cracks were tortures and irregular due the presence of micro particles in the matrix. The cracks during their growth often contoured around the inert particle inclusions and resulted in enhanced energy absorption capacity of the cement composites. The study was further enhanced to the cement mortar composites and their performances were studied. The results indicated that the energy absorption behavior of the composites was enhanced for all the cement composites containing micro carbonized particles. Finally, it is concluded that the ductility and toughness properties of the cement composites can be enhanced by incorporating the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particles in the cement matrix. The fracture energy, ductility and toughness properties enhancement of the cement composites greatly depends upon the source and synthesis procedure followed for the production of <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> inert carbonized particle...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{the aged}} {{population}} grows around the world, many medical instruments and devices {{have been developed}} recently. Among the devices, a drug delivery stent is a medical device which requires precision machining. Conventional drug delivery stent has problems of residual polymer and decoating because the drug is coated {{on the surface of}} stent with the polymer. If the drug is impregnated in the <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> holes on the surface, the problems can be overcome because {{there is no need to}} use the polymer anymore. <b>Micro</b> <b>sized</b> holes are generally fabricated by laser machining; however, the fabricated holes do not have a high aspect ratio or a good surface finish. To overcome these problems, we propose a vibration-assisted machining mechanism with PZT (Piezoelectric Transducers) for the fabrication of <b>micro</b> <b>sized</b> holes. If the mechanism vibrates the eyepiece of the laser machining head, the laser spot on the workpiece will vibrate vertically because objective lens in the eyepiece shakes by the mechanism's vibration. According to the former researches, the vibrating frequency over 20 kHz and amplitude over 500 nm are preferable. The vibration mechanism has cylindrical guide, hollowed PZT and supports. In the cylinder, the eyepiece is mounted. The cylindrical guide has upper and low plates and side wall. The shape of plates and side wall are designed to have high resonating frequency and large amplitude of motion. The PZT is also selected to have high actuating force and high speed of motion. The support has symmetrical and rigid configuration. The mechanism secures linear motion of the eyepiece. This research includes sensitivity analysis and design of ultrasonic vibration mechanism.
