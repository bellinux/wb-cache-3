25|$|On July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Gregg v. Georgia and upheld 7-2 a Georgia {{procedure}} {{in which the}} trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> in assessing the ultimate penalty - either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana, the court struck down 5-4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing that juries {{in capital}} cases found {{discretion}} in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury could respond to <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> {{about the crime}} or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900 23 {{states and the federal}} government had discretionary sentencing in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and by 1963 all death-penalty jurisdictions employed discretionary sentencing.|$|E

25|$|On March 14, 2001, {{a federal}} jury convicted Gilbert on three counts of first-degree murder, {{one count of}} second-degree murder and two counts of {{attempted}} murder. Though Massachusetts does not have capital punishment, her crimes were committed on federal property and thus subject to the death penalty. Prosecutors, {{in an attempt to}} secure a penalty of death, sought to admit evidence of aggravating factors during the penalty phase, including Gilbert's 1998 conviction for the bomb threat; the defense introduced evidence of <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> including the well-being of Gilbert's two children.|$|E
25|$|In Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} such a {{mandatory}} sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile was unconstitutional, even for a person who committed murder, as it did not allow for what is scientifically known about juvenile brains, nor for <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> and cut off the possibility of reform {{that might lead to}} freedom. It directed state courts to review sentences for all persons covered under this ruling, an estimated 1200 to 1800 nationwide. Draper and Adamcik are among the inmates whose sentences will be reviewed by state courts under this ruling.|$|E
25|$|The Council of London in 1102 in 1102, {{called at}} the urging of Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, {{explicitly}} denounced homosexual behavior as a sin {{for the first time at}} an English council. Anselm felt that sodomy was widespread and was not condemned strongly enough or regarded with the seriousness that it should have. Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions for sodomy, and to take into account <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm deferred publication of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters. Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.|$|E

The sentences were all reduced on appeal, with the poor leadership and use of racial slurs by MPs considered <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors.</b> General Ira C. Eaker, commander of the Eighth Air Force, placed {{the majority of the}} blame on the white officers and MPs and to prevent such an incident happening again, he combined the black trucking units into a single special command. The ranks of this command were purged of inexperienced and racist officers, and the MP patrols were racially integrated. Morale among black troops stationed in England improved, and the rates of courts-martial and venereal disease both fell, although there were several more minor conflicts between black and white American troops in Britain during the war.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Clarence E. Hill {{was convicted}} {{of the murder of}} a Pensacola, Florida police officer, and {{subsequently}} sentenced to death in 1985, in the Florida Supreme Court case of Hill v. State. At a resentencing hearing in 1986, Hill’s death sentence was reinstated, this time being upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. In November 1989, a warrant for Hill’s execution was signed by then Governor Robert Martinez, after which Hill sought postconviction relief in both the Florida state courts and the U.S. District Court. In 1992, Hill’s relief was granted when it was ruled that the Florida Supreme Court as well as Hill’s trial court had not properly reevaluated the aggravating factors warranting a death sentence when one of them was vacated. In Hill v. State, the Florida Supreme Court, having sufficiently reweighed the <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> resentenced Hill to death. Hill then sought federal habeas corpus relief, which was first denied by the U.S. District Court, then affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of Bonin's defense attorneys, William Charvet and Tracy Stewart, was {{to challenge the}} credibility of numerous prosecution witnesses, and to suggest that extremely significant <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> as to {{the root causes of}} Bonin's behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his childhood and adolescence. To support this contention, Bonin's defense attorneys summoned an expert on the developmental effects of violence and abuse on children named Dr. David Foster, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations upon Bonin. Dr. Foster opined that Bonin had, as a result of repeated abandonment, not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback as a child necessary for sufficient psychological development. This had been so consistent and prevalent, Foster stated, that Bonin held a confusion as to the differences between violence and love. In a direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned a forensic psychiatrist and expert in both impulse disorders and sexual sadism named Dr. Park Dietz, who testified that the overall pattern of Bonin's behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses. Dr. Dietz further testified as to Bonin's actions being reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. In summary, Dr. Dietz concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although Bonin suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.|$|E

500|$|There are {{two general}} types of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Murder {{requires}} an intention {{to kill or}} an intention to commit grievous bodily harm.

There are two types of involuntary manslaughter. Firstly, it may be [...] "constructive" [...] or [...] "unlawful act" [...] manslaugher, where a lesser but inherently criminal and dangerous act has caused the death. Alternatively, manslaughter may be caused by gross negligence, where the defendant has broken a duty of care over the victim, where that breach has led to the death, and is sufficiently gross as to warrant criminalisation.|$|E

500|$|Model's {{assault was}} a failure, as Ninth Army quickly became enmeshed in the {{elaborate}} Soviet fortifications. The Red Army's {{strength in the}} salient was, in fact, growing much faster {{than that of the}} attacking force. Nor did his tactical plan of attack meet with great success. Having less armour and more artillery than Manstein in the south, and fearing that the deep Soviet defences would stall an armour-heavy attack (the hallmark of the German Blitzkrieg), he decided to use his infantry to breach Rokossovsky's line before unleashing his armour. It did not work. The Germans took heavy losses to advance less than 12km (8mi) in seven days, and were unable to break through to open ground. Model threw his armour into the fray, but with little effect, beyond incurring more casualties. (As <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> the Red Army had concentrated more of their strength facing Model in the north; and Rokossovsky had correctly anticipated where the attack would come, defending that sector heavily. Model's use of infantry assaults also meant his losses in armour were lower than Manstein's.) ...|$|E

The Senior District Judge also took into account <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> specific to the case– the offending acts by the accused persons were halted early on, and they had taken action to reduce the offensiveness of the acts. One of the accused persons issued an apology and removed the offending material from public access, while the other locked the discussion thread containing the offending statement and also tendered a written apology.
