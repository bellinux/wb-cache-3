Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.|$|E

5|$|Eystein married Ingebjørg Guttormsdatter, from a {{prominent}} noble family of Gudbrandsdalen. Their marriage {{was part of}} Eystein's strategy of building alliances in Eastern Norway. They had a daughter, Maria, who became {{the mother of the}} future royal pretender Olaf Ugjæva by her <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lendmann Gudbrand Skavhoggsson. Olaf was named king in 1165, during the Norwegian civil war era, but was subsequently defeated by Magnus Erlingsson and forced to flee the country.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E

5|$|In the Uttara Kanda {{book of the}} Ramayana (regarded by most {{scholars}} as a later addition to the epic), Brahma crafts Ahalya as {{the most beautiful woman}} and places her in the care of Gautama until she reaches puberty. When that time arrives, the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma, who, impressed by Gautama's sexual restraint and asceticism, bestows her upon him. Indra, who believes that the best women are meant for him, resents Ahalya's <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest-dwelling ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Kidd died {{of cancer}} at the age 92 {{at his home in}} Los Angeles, California. His <b>{{marriage}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dancer Mary Heater in 1945 ended in divorce. At his death he was survived by his wife Shelah Hackett, whom he married in 1969, two daughters from his first marriage and a son and daughter from his second.|$|E
5|$|Leopold Clement's younger brother, Francis Stephen, {{was invited}} to Vienna. Even though Francis Stephen was his {{favourite}} candidate for Maria Theresa's hand, the Emperor considered other possibilities. Religious differences prevented him from arranging his daughter's <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Calvinist prince Frederick of Prussia. In 1725, he betrothed her to Charles of Spain and her sister, Maria Anna, to Philip of Spain. Other European powers compelled him to renounce the pact he had made with the Queen of Spain, Elisabeth Farnese. Maria Theresa, who had become close to Francis Stephen, was relieved.|$|E

5|$|Mary Meader {{was born}} to William H. and Genevieve Upjohn in Kalamazoo, Michigan on April 15, 1916, a {{grandchild}} of Dr. W. E. Upjohn, {{the founder of the}} pharmaceutical Upjohn Company. Meader majored in French and Spanish at Smith College. She left the college in preparation for a <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neurosurgeon Richard Upjohn Light, a first cousin of hers. Since the two could not legally marry each other in Michigan, they moved to Maryland, where they married in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Welsh princess {{to claim a}} genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|The de Clevedon family line {{ended in}} 1376, and the manor {{eventually}} passed, by <b>marriage,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northamptonshire family of Wake, who were Lords of the Manor until 1630. John Wake made major {{additions to the}} house in the late 16th century, including a new west wing. The manor was sold by Sir John Wake to Sir John Digby in 1630. Digby's estates were confiscated during the English Civil War, but were recovered after the Restoration by his heir. In 1709 the house was bought by Abraham Elton, a merchant from Bristol.|$|E

50|$|Later, Cherveux Castle {{was passed}} via {{successive}} <b>marriages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Puyguion and St. Gelais families. Although {{it was a}} principle, formidable stronghold, it was, nevertheless, taken in 1569 by the Marquis of Lude who installed a garrison of swordsmen and then again in 1574 by the Duc of Montpensier.|$|R
5|$|The {{house was}} {{substantially}} remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dowager Duchess of Somerset, {{and much of}} the existing south facade dates from this time. The facade's central tower with a belvedere is a motif of the English Renaissance of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. Hatfield House, also close to London, had a similar central tower constructed in 1611, as does Blickling Hall in Norfolk, built circa 1616.|$|E
5|$|Upon the childless {{death of}} Roger in 1155, the Earldom of Hereford fell into {{abeyance}} until 1199 when King John bestowed the title on Henry de Bohun, Sibyl's grandson through her eldest daughter, Margaret. As her sons all died without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through <b>marriage)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> de Braoses, thereby making them {{one of the}} most powerful families in the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135 the {{succession}} was disputed between the king's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually {{known as the}} Empress Matilda because of her first <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 {{she returned to her}} father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman conquest {{the manor}} {{was held by}} the Bishop of Coutances and later reverted to the crown, after which William II gave it to a {{merchant}} from Bristol known as Harding and then to his son Robert Fitzharding who became Lord of Berkeley. The Berkeley family held it for generations until it passed by <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cokes of Holkham in Norfolk. In the 14th century it belonged to Everard le Frenshe. In 1621 the Bristol Corporation purchased large portions of land in Portishead and revived the Manor Court. The rights of the corporation over the manor was disputed but they held it until 1836 when they sold it for £8,050. The parish of Portishead {{was part of the}} Portbury Hundred.|$|E
5|$|Alexius Slav's <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{daughter}} of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, {{who could be}} facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though {{it is more likely that}} the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|As {{the regular}} sacrifices {{continue}} the islanders approach the king for help, {{as they are}} worried there will soon be no young girls left. The king again asks {{the advice of the}} spaeman, who tentatively suggests that the king's only daughter, Princess Gem-de-lovely, his most prized possession, will have to be offered to the stoor worm to encourage it to leave. During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> princess, and the magic sword the king had inherited from the god Odin.|$|E
