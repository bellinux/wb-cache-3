25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|In one {{incident}} in 2014, the city delayed mailing out the violations {{for a few}} months, causing violators to receive multiple tickets that added up {{to as much as}} $7,000. According to one commentator for The New York Times, this did not serve the purpose of the cameras, which were to educate drivers and keep the bus lanes empty of cars. The city agreed to review the violations and to keep each driver liable only for the first violation they received. There was a bus lane camera on Staten Island that gave tickets to drivers who failed to make an immediate right turn, even though {{it was not possible to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> turn, since the next possible turn was a private driveway or a one-way street that had traffic running in the opposite direction. One retired police officer showed that his ticket was withheld by the judge and the appeals system. The city eventually turned off the camera.|$|E

25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|The idea Gough and Millar came up {{with for}} their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his [...] "... bare essence ...", {{discovering}} the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El {{at the end of}} season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die. Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.|$|E
500|$|Tom Welling {{feels that}} the deal Jonathan made with Jor-El at the {{beginning}} of season three made Jonathan realize that he will not always be around to protect Clark. Welling believes that it is the repercussions of that deal that allow Jonathan to give Clark more freedom in the choices that he makes during season three. Jonathan realizes that he must help Clark find the confidence in his ability to survive on his own, so that he can leave home one day. One scene that Schneider specifically remembers {{was at the end of}} season three's [...] "Forsaken". Here, Jonathan admits to not trusting his own instincts anymore and allowing Clark to rely on his. This [...] "admission of fallibility", but faith in his son's ability to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choices, is what Schneider sees as the growing of the family dynamic.|$|E

500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life. You really root for him to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E
500|$|Cruz {{has donated}} {{money and time}} to charity. In {{addition}} to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, The Hi-Lo Country, to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, {{most of whom are}} former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: [...] "These kids break my heart. I have to control myself not to cry. Not out of pity, but seeing how tricky life is and {{how hard it is to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choices." [...] A pregnant Cruz showed her support for the battle against AIDS by lighting up the Empire State Building with red lights in New York City on 1 December 2010 on International AIDS Day, as part of (RED)'s new awareness campaign, 'An AIDS Free Generation is Due in 2015,' which aims to eradicate the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies. [...] In 2012, she posed for an ad supporting PETA's anti-fur campaign.|$|E
500|$|Homer is [...] "a (happy) {{slave to}} his various appetites", and would gladly sell his {{soul to the}} devil in {{exchange}} for a single donut. He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Incan mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene" [...] (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the episode [...] "HOMR" [...] (season 12, 2001) Homer gets surgery to remove the (newly discovered) crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level. Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decisions, but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him. Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers [...] "used every possible permutation". These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.|$|E

Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the majority opinion, stated that compulsory process was critical to the very ability to [...] "present a defense... defendant's version of the facts".
