2500|$|On January 8, 2014, Giffords {{marked the}} three-year {{anniversary of the}} {{shooting}} by going skydiving. The jump garnered a lot of support. Giffords said on {{an interview with the}} Today show, [...] "Oh, wonderful sky. Gorgeous <b>mountain.</b> <b>Blue</b> skies. I like a lot. A lot of fun. Peaceful, so peaceful." ...|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, {{during the}} 1930s and 1940s, the Blue Network {{was divided into}} groups of {{stations}}. [...] The core group of stations was known as [...] "Basic Blue", and covered the Northeast United States/New England and portions of the Upper Midwest, around the Great Lakes area. The Southern Blue Network covered the Deep South, the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Blue</b> Group the Mountain states, the Pacific Coast Blue Network the Pacific Coast states, and the Southwestern Blue Group the Oklahoma-Texas region.|$|E
2500|$|Scarps {{associated}} with Holocene uplift of the Tacoma fault have been traced westward to Prickett Lake (southwest of Belfair, see map). The Tacoma fault was initially suspected of following a weak magnetic anomaly {{west to the}} Frigid Creek fault, but is now believed to connect with a steep gravitational, aeromagnetic, and seismic velocity gradient that strikes north towards Green <b>Mountain</b> (<b>Blue</b> Hills uplift). This is the Dewatto lineament, believed to result from an east-dipping low-angle thrust fault where the western flank of the Seattle Uplift has been pushed into the northwestern corner of the Tacoma Basin. [...] It appears that the Seattle Uplift is acting as a rigid block, with the Tacoma, Dewatto, and Seattle faults being the southern, western, and northern faces. This may explain why the Seattle and Tacoma faults seem to have ruptured at nearly the same time.|$|E

6000|$|It was a [...] "day of God." [...] The earth lay {{like one}} great emerald, ringed and roofed with sapphire; blue sea, blue <b>mountain,</b> <b>blue</b> sky overhead. There she lay, not sleeping, but basking in her quiet Sabbath joy, {{as though her}} two great sisters, {{of the sea and}} air, had washed her weary limbs with holy tears, and purged away the stains of last week's sin and toil, and cooled her hot worn {{forehead}} with their pure incense-breath, and folded her within their azure robes, and brooded over her with smiles of pitying love, till she smiled back in answer, and took heart and hope for next week's weary work.|$|E
6000|$|Prince Karl with Weissenfels, General Berlichingen {{and many}} plumed dignitaries, are dining on the Hill-top near Hohenfriedberg: after having given order about everything, they witness there, over their wine, {{the issue of}} their Columns from the Mountains; which goes on all afternoon, with field-music, spread banners; and the oldest General admits he never saw a finer review-manoeuvre, or one better done, if so well. Thus sit they on the Hill-top (GALGENBERG, {{not far from the}} gallows of the place, says Friedrich), in the {{beautiful}} June afternoon. Silesia lying beautifully azure at their feet; the Zobtenberg, enchanted <b>Mountain,</b> <b>blue</b> and high on one's eastern horizon; Prussians noticeable only in weak hussar parties four or five miles off, which vanish in the hollow grounds again. All intending for Breslau, they, it is like;--and here, red wine and the excellent manoeuvre going on. [...] "The Austrian-and-Saxon Army streamed out all afternoon," [...] says a Country Schoolmaster of those parts, whose Day-book has been preserved, [In Lutzow, pp. 123-132.] [...] "each regiment or division taking the place appointed it; all afternoon, till late in the night, submerging the Country as in a deluge," [...] five miles long of them; taking post {{at the foot of the}} Hills there, from Hohenfriedberg round upon Striegau, looking towards the morrow's sunrise. To us poor country-folk not a beautiful sight; their light troops flying ahead, and doing theft and other mischief at a sad rate.|$|E
