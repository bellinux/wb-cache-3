25|$|In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev {{tried to}} reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika. His {{policies}} relaxed state control over enterprises, {{but did not}} yet {{allow it to be}} replaced by <b>market</b> <b>incentives,</b> ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output. The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world {{during the middle of the}} 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries. When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give <b>market</b> <b>incentives</b> for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

A field study conducted at a corporate cafeteria and three lab studies converge on a consistent finding: The effects of <b>marketing</b> <b>incentives</b> on healthy food choice are particularly prominent {{for people who have}} less healthy eating habits. Results showed that behavioral rewards generated a 28. 5 % (vs. 5. 5 %) increase in salad sales; behavioral rewards also led to 2 pounds more weight loss for individuals with less healthy eating habits. The research offers important implications for scholars, the food industry, consumers, governments, and policy makers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGrid parity of {{residential}} photovoltaic (PV) power generation and retail electricity prices makes self-consumption of solar power increasingly interesting for private households. Residential PV Battery Systems provide {{the opportunity to}} store solar energy that is not locally consumed {{during the day and}} make it available for self-consumption in the evening, thus cutting the electricity bill. Moreover, decentralized stationary battery systems are a promising technology to deal with grid problems that can arise due to high local penetration of solar power generation. Because relatively high system costs for small stationary battery systems still pose an obstacle for a broad market launch, the German Federal Government has issued a <b>market</b> <b>incentive</b> program to stimulate the market and boost technology development of PV Battery Systems. In order to additionally {{gain a better understanding of}} the technology under realistic operating conditions, an accompanying scientific monitoring program has been established from the beginning. This paper outlines the most important terms and conditions of the <b>market</b> <b>incentive</b> program, the methodology of the monitoring program and presents first results of the current market situation of government-funded PV Battery Systems in Germany...|$|R

50|$|There is {{justification}} for market failure {{to respond to}} environmental protection and climate protection needs with the excuse that high external costs and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of green energy sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints.

The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such <b>market</b> <b>incentives.</b> However, other experts argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One {{strategy}} for lowering {{the prevalence of}} obesity is to increase access to and affordability {{of fruits and vegetables}} through farmers’ markets. However, little has been documented in the literature on the implementation of such efforts. To address this gap, the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) sponsored an evaluation of the New York City Health Bucks program, a farmers’ <b>market</b> coupon <b>incentive</b> program intended to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables in underserved neighborhoods while supporting local farmers. Methods We conducted a process evaluation of Health Bucks program implementation. We interviewed 6 farmer/vendors, 3 market managers, and 4 program administrators, and collected data on site at 86 farmers’ markets, including surveys of 81 managers and 141 farmer/vendors on their perspectives on promotion and redemption of the incentive coupons; knowledge and attitudes regarding the program; experiences with markets and products; and facilitators and barriers to program participation. Results Results indicate that respondents view Health Bucks as a positive program model. Farmers’ <b>market</b> <b>incentive</b> coupon programs like Health Bucks are one strategy {{to address the problem of}} obesity and were associated with higher fruit and vegetable access and purchases in low-income communities. Conclusions This evaluation identified some areas for improving implementation of the Health Bucks program. Farmers’ <b>market</b> <b>incentive</b> programs like Health Bucks may be one avenue to increase access to and affordability of fruits and vegetables among low-income persons. Further research is needed to assess the potential effects of these programs on access and health outcomes...|$|R
