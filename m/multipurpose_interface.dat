40|$|A {{real-time}} processor for the Danish high-resolution SAR {{is presented}} {{in terms of its}} functional performance, algorithm, architecture, and implementation. The real-time processor is mainly intended to assist the operator in using the SAR system, but since the processor has been designed to produce high-quality images, it is expected to make off-line processing superfluous in many cases. The range-Doppler algorithm is adopted and supplemented with an extensive motion compensation, considering the special conditions related to the real-time strip mapping of large scenes. The processor is a pipeline of about 20 elements interconnected by a dedicated data path and a control bus. Only three different types of elements are involved: a programmable signal processing element, a multipurpose memory element, and a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>interface</b> element. The prototypes of these three elements have been tested with satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present a}} new method of {{recognizing}} different human facial gestures through their neural activities and muscle movements, {{which can be}} used in machine-interfacing applications. Human–machine interface (HMI) technology utilizes human neural activities as input controllers for the machine. Recently, much work has been done on the specific application of facial electromyography (EMG) -based HMI, which have used limited and fixed numbers of facial gestures. In this work, a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>interface</b> is suggested that can support 2 – 11 control commands that can be applied to various HMI systems. The significance of this work is finding the most accurate facial gestures for any application with a maximum of eleven control commands. Eleven facial gesture EMGs are recorded from ten volunteers. Detected EMGs are passed through a band-pass filter and root mean square features are extracted. Various combinations of gestures with a different number of gestures in each group are made from the existing facial gestures.

40|$|The use {{of diesel}} engine has been {{increasing}} in agricultural and industrial applications. The unfavorable diesel smoke, however, discourage the wide-spread use due to health hazards. The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>interface</b> board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented. Adaptive control with on-line identification and appropriate sensors leads to an integrated engine management system...|$|E

30|$|The EDR device {{continuously}} produces {{files from}} the acquired data (see sub-chapter 2.1. 4). In {{the case of}} regular network condition, the finished files should {{be transferred to the}} data storage immediately. In the case of network congestion or receiving service failure, local buffering and subsequent transport must be ensured as soon as possible after the delay. After confirmation of successful transfer to the storage, the files have to be deleted from the local disk because of limited storage capacity. If 20 GB are produced a day, a disk capacity of 500 GB would last approximately 3 to 4 weeks for intermediate buffering. For the local management of data files and the reliable transport to the storage, we develop the <b>multipurpose</b> file transport <b>interface</b> EDR-Netpipe, which is running on each EDR capturing device.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of biological information has become critically {{dependent on the}} Internet and World Wide Web (WWW), which enable distributed access to information in a platform independent manner. The mode of interaction between biologists and on-line information resources, however, has been mostly limited to simple interface technologies such has hypertext links, tables and forms. The introduction of platform-independent runtime environments facilitates {{the development of more}} sophisticated WWW-based user interfaces. Until recently, most such interfaces have been tightly coupled to the underlying computation engines, and not separated as reusable components. We believe that many subdisciplines of biology have intuitive and familiar graphical representations of knowledge that can serve as <b>multipurpose</b> user <b>interface</b> elements. We call such graphical idioms "domain graphics. " In order to illustrate the power of such graphics, we have built a reusable interface based on the standard two dimensional (2 D) layout of RNA secondary structure. The interface can be used to represent any pre-computed layout of RNA, and takes as a parameters the sets of actions to be performed as a user interacts with the interface. It can provide to any associated application program information about the base, helix, or subsequence selected by the user. We show the versatility of this interface by using it as a special purpose interface to BLAST, Medline and the RNA MFOLD search/compute engines.

The home rehabilitation station has a Pentium II PC with graphics accelerator, a Polhemus tracker, and a <b>multipurpose</b> haptic control <b>interface.</b> This novel interface {{is used to}} sample a pa-tient’s hand positions and to provide resistive forces using the Rut-gers Master II (RMII) glove. A library of virtual rehabilitation rou-tines was developed using WorldToolKit software. At the present time, it consists of three physical therapy exercises (DigiKey, ball, and power putty) and two functional rehabilitation exercises (peg board and ball game). These virtual reality exercises allow auto-matic and transparent patient data collection into an Oracle data-base. A remote Pentium II PC is connected with the home-based PC over the Internet and an additional video conferencing connection. The remote computer is running an Oracle server to maintain the patient database, monitor progress, and change the exercise level of difficulty. This allows for patient progress monitoring and re-peat evaluations over time. The telerehabilitation system is in clin-ical trails at Stanford Medical School (CA), with progress being monitored from Rutgers University (NJ). Other haptic interfaces currently under development include devices for elbow and knee rehabilitation connected to the same system.

40|$|NEXUS, the NASA Engineering Extendible Unified Software system, is a {{research}} set of computer programs designed to support the full sequence of activities encountered in NASA engineering projects. This sequence spans preliminary design, design analysis, detailed design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing. NEXUS primarily addresses the process of prototype engineering, the task of getting a single or small number of copies of a product to work. Prototype engineering is a critical element of large scale industrial production. The time and cost needed to introduce a new product are heavily dependent on two factors: 1) how efficiently required product prototypes can be developed, and 2) how efficiently required production facilities, also a prototype engineering development, can be completed. NEXUS extendibility and unification are achieved by organizing the system as an arbitrarily large set of computer programs accessed in a common manner through a standard user interface. The NEXUS <b>interface</b> is a <b>multipurpose</b> interactive graphics <b>interface</b> called NASCAD (NASA Computer Aided Design). NASCAD {{can be used to}} build and display two and three-dimensional geometries, to annotate models with dimension lines, text strings, etc., and to store and retrieve design related information such as names, masses, and power requirements of components used in the design. From the user's standpoint, NASCAD allows the construction, viewing, modification, and other processing of data structures that represent the design. Four basic types of data structures are supported by NASCAD: 1) three-dimensional geometric models of the object being designed, 2) alphanumeric arrays to hold data ranging from numeric scalars to multidimensional arrays of numbers or characters, 3) tabular data sets that provide a relational data base capability, and 4) procedure definitions to combine groups of system commands or other user procedures to create more powerful functions. NASCAD has extensive abilities to handle IGES format data, including proposed solid geometry formats. This facilitates interfacing with other CAD systems. NEXUS/NASCAD supports the activities encountered in various engineering projects as follows: 1) Preliminary Design - Geometric models can be built from points, lines, arcs, splines, polygons, drive surfaces, ruled surfaces, and bicubic spline surfaces. Geometric models can be displayed in any view (including hidden line and hidden surface removal) to check design features, 2) Design Analysis - Geometric models and related data structures can be used to build a NASTRAN data deck. Calculated stress data can be added to model data structures and displayed as color variations on the geometric model, 3) Detailed Design - This phase consists of dimensioning and annotating the geometric model and generating manufacturing and assembly drawings, 4) Manufacturing - NASCAD developed geometric model and related data structures can be used to build input for the APT program which generates a cutter location (CL) file describing required tool motions, 5) Assembly - Generation of a robot plan for putting together or taking apart (repair) of a mechanical assembly based on an IGES solid geometry description, and 6) Testing - Correlation of test data can be made with predictions made during the design analysis phase. NEXUS/NASCAD is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the source, executable code, command streams, and one set of documentation. Additional documentation may be purchased separately at any time. The NASTRAN and APT programs are distributed separately from the NEXUS/NASCAD system (contact COSMIC for details). The NEXUS/NASCAD system is written in FORTRAN 77 and PROLOG, with command streams in DEC Control Language (DCL), for interactive execution under VMS on a DEC VAX series computer. All of the PROLOG code deals with the robot strategy planner feature. A minimum recommended configuration is a DEC VAX with 1 megabyte of real memory, 100 megabytes of disk storage, and a floating point accelerator. For interactive graphics, NEXUS/NASCAD currently supports Tektronix 4114, 4016, 4115, & 4095 terminal, Lexidata Solidview terminals, and Ramtek 9400 terminals. Most features are supported on the VT 125, and the non-graphics features are available from any text terminal. The NEXUS/NASCAD system was first released in 1984 and was last updated in 1986...|$|R
