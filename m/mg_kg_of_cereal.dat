40|$|Hematopoietic {{growth factors}} (HGF) are {{recommended}} therapy for high dose radiation exposure, but unfavorable administration schedules requiring early and repeat dosing limit the logistical {{ease with which}} they can be used. In this report, using a previously described murine model of H-ARS, survival efficacy and effect on hematopoietic recovery of unique PEGylated HGF were investigated. The PEGylated-HGFs possess longer half-lives and more potent hematopoietic properties than corresponding non-PEGylated-HGFs. C 57 BL/ 6 mice underwent single dose lethal irradiation (7. 76 - 8. 72 Gy, Cs, 0. 62 - 1. 02 Gy min) and were treated with various dosing regimens of 0. 1, 0. 3, and 1. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> analogs of human PEG-G-CSF, murine PEG-GM-CSF, or human PEG-IL- 11. Mice were administered one of the HGF analogs at 24 - 28 h post irradiation, and in some studies, additional doses given every other day (beginning with the 24 - 28 h dose) {{for a total of}} three or nine doses. Thirty-day (30 d) survival was significantly increased with only one dose <b>of</b> 0. 3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> PEG-G-CSF and PEG-IL- 11 or three doses <b>of</b> 0. 3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> PEG-GM-CSF (p ≤ 0. 006). Enhanced survival correlated with consistently and significantly enhanced WBC, NE, RBC, and PLT recovery for PEG-G- and PEG-GM-CSF, and enhanced RBC and PLT recovery for PEG-IL- 11 (p ≤ 0. 05). Longer administration schedules or higher doses did not provide a significant additional survival benefit over the shorter, lower dose, schedules.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of different levels of Oil Extract of Propolis (OEP) on immune system of broiler chickens from 1 to 47 days of age. Chicks were fed soybean meal-corn diets supplemented with levels of 0, 40, 70, 100, 400, 700 and 1000 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> OEP from hatching. On days 20 and 32, they were immunized with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and examined 10 days later. In general, the immune system can be stimulated by addition of OEP, without affecting the performance. At 30 days of age after immunization at 20 days, antibody response to NDV was significantly increased in chickens fed with 70 and 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> OEP in the diet (p< 0. 05). No effect of dietary OEP was observed on the ratio of gamma globulins to total serum proteins. Heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was significantly decreased in chickens fed with 40 and 70 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> OEP in the diet (p< 0. 05). Investigation of histological sections revealed that the number of proliferating cells of bursa of fabricius was increased in chickens fed with 1000 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> OEP in the diet. When broilers received the high levels (400, 700 and 1000 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) <b>of</b> OEP in the diet the number of leukocytes in the lamina propria of intestine was higher compared with other levels of dietary OEP.

However, the increasing anthropogenic uses of metal-containing nanoparticles (NPs) such as CuO-NPs {{in urban areas}} may contaminate vegetables through foliar uptake. This study focused on the CuO-NP transfer processes in leafy edible vegetables (i. e., lettuce and cabbage) to assess their potential phytotoxicity. Vegetables were exposed via leaves for 5, 10, or 15 days to various concentrations of CuO-NPs (0, 10, or 250 mg per plant).

40|$|I. The Effect of Chlorpromazine on the Eosinophil Cell Count. By {{determining}} the eosinophil cell {{count in the}} blood by the direct counting method, studies were made on how the eosinophil cell count is influenced by chlorpromazine administered subcutaneously. Experiments were carried out in rats under varying conditions. (1) Three groups of normal rats were injected subcutaneously with chlorpromazine in doses of 1, 5 and 20 <b>mg.</b> per <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body weight, respectively, and the eosinophil cell count was estimated after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours. There {{was no significant difference}} between the cell counts made before and after injection of chlorpromazine in a group to which chlorpromazine in a dose <b>of</b> 1 <b>mg.</b> pet <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body weight was injected. However, in groups to which chlorpromazine was given in doses over 5 <b>mg,</b> per <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body weight, the cell count showed a decrease in the initial stage following administration of chlorpromazine. It tended to show a larger decrease for a longer duration in groups to which a greater amount of chlorprmazine was injected. (2) Similar experiments were carried out in rats from which either the adrenal glands on both sides of the hypophysis had been removed experimentally. Administration of chlorpromazine in doses over 5 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> body weight hardly caused any decrease in the cell count. (3) Premedication of chlorpromazine in a dose <b>of</b> 5 <b>mg.</b> per <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body accelerated the decrease of the eosinophil cell count resultant from the stress to which rats had been exposed-the stress of the administration of adrenaline in a dose of 0. 5 <b>mg.</b> per <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body weight and of histamine in a dose <b>of</b> 5 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> body weight, and of surgical operation. (4) In rabbits in which deep anesthesia had been produced by either ether or phenobarbital, the decrease of the eosinophil cell count arising from subcutaneous injection of chlorpromazine. in a dose <b>of</b> 5 <b>mg.</b> per <b>kg.</b> body weight was inhibited moderately in rats under the influence of ether and completely in those under the influence of phenobarbital. (5) Results of the present experiments would suggest that chlorpromazine, when given in a larger dose (over 5 <b>mg.</b> per <b>kg.</b> <b>of</b> body weight), may have an action of stimulating the diencephalon-hypophysis-adrenal cortex system. II. The Influence of Chlorpromazine on Thyroid Uptake of I^ in Rats. Experiments were performed to determine whether chlorpromazine had any influences on thyroid uptake of I^ and I^ content of the plasma in rats under varying conditions. A tracer dose of I^ was injected into the abdominal cavity and I^ was estimated by the direct method 4, 16, 24 and 48 hours after injection. The values in rats to which chlorpromazine had been injected were compared with the corresponding values in rats not injected with chlorpromazine, which served as the control. (1) Thyroid uptake of I^ fell as the result of injection of chlorpromazine in normal rats. The greater the amount injected, the lower was thyroid uptake of I^ and the longer was the duration of its effect to inhibit the uptake. (2) Thyroid uptake of I^ was generally higher in rats from which the adrenals had beed removed surgically than in normal ones. Yet, chlorpromazine was almost as effective in the former as in the latter in reducing thyroid uptake of I^. (3) Thyroid uptake of I^ was markedly lower in rats from which the hypophysis had been removed surgically than in normal ones. Injection of chlorpromazine did not result in appreciable fall in thyroid uptake of I^ in rats from which the hypophysis had been removed. (4) In normal rats and rats from which the adrenals had been removed sugically, injection of chlorpromazine caused an initial fall in thyroid uptake of I^, which was followed by a transient rise. (5) Chlorpromazine had no marked effect on I^ content of the plasma in rats under varying conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of Pb inhibited {{the development of}} mycelia of the saprobe fungi Fusarium concolor and Trichoderma koningii and the hyphal length of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) Glomus mosseae and G. deserticola in vitro. The application to soil <b>of</b> 1500 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 <b>of</b> Pb decreases the dry weight, total N, P, Mg and Fe concentration and chlorophyll content of the shoot of E. globulus no inoculated with AM fungi. However, G. deserticola increased the dry weight, total nutrient concentration and chlorophyll content of the shoot, {{and the percentage of}} AM root length colonization and the succinate dehydrogenase activity of AM mycelia of E. globulus in presence <b>of</b> 1500 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 <b>of</b> Pb, and these increases were higher when G. deserticola was inoculated together with T. koningii. The application to soil <b>of</b> 3000 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 <b>of</b> Pb decreased the shoot dry weight and AM colonization of E. globulus in all treatments tested. Pb was accumulated in the stem more than in the leaves of E. globulus. In presence <b>of</b> 1500 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 <b>of</b> Pb the highest accumulation of this metal in the stem took place when E. globulus was colonized with G. deserticola. In conclusion, the possibility to increase Lead accumulation in stem is very attractive for phytoextraction function, the saprobe fungi, AM and their interaction may have a potential role in elevating phytoextraction efficiency and stimulate plant growth under adverse conditions such as lead contaminated soil...|$|R
40|$|Female rats are {{relatively}} {{more sensitive to}} reduced lipid versus reduced carbohydrate availability DA Sandoval 1, KK Ryan 1, AD de Kloet 1, SC Woods 2 and RJ Seeley 1 OBJECTIVES: Because females have blunted counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia relative to males, we hypothesized that females would have greater sensitivity to changes in lipid availability. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: To assess this, we examined the feeding response to glucoprivation (2 -deoxyglucose; 2 DG) and lipoprivation (mercaptoacetate; MA) in age-matched male and female Long-Evans rats. RESULTS: Males versus females had significantly greater food intake after 250 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 <b>of</b> 2 DG, {{but there were no}} sex differences with the 750 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 dose <b>of</b> 2 DG. Glucose responses to 250 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 <b>of</b> 2 DG were also significantly greater in males versus females. In contrast, females had a significant increase in food intake with all doses of MA versus saline, and had significantly greater food intake compared with males at the lowest and highest doses of MA with a trend towards significance with the intermediate dose. To determine whether estradiol (E 2) is the mechanism underlying this sexual dimorphism, ovariectomized females were injected with vehicle or 2 mg of E 2 every fourth day to mimic the variations in across the estrous cycle. Ovariectomized females significantly increased feeding and glucose after 250 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 <b>of</b> 2 DG over intact females and E 2 had no effect on these responses. Although the feeding response to 2 DG was not different, the glucose response to 2 DG was still significantly greater in males versus ovariectomies females. However, ovariectomized females also did not increase food intake after MA, regardless of E 2 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data collectively suggest that males {{are relatively}} more sensitive to glucose deprivation and females are relatively more sensitive to lipid deprivation. Further, these data rule out a role for cyclic changes in E 2 in these sex differences...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of dopamine (DA) and zinc (Zn) on some physiological parameters of plasma such as growth hormone, cholesterol, 3 -glyceride and growth rate, {{feed conversion ratio}} and abdominal fat of broilers {{between the ages of}} 21 to 42 day were investigated. The experiment was designed on a total of 180 commercial meat-type chicks as a randomized complete block with a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with three levels of DA (0, 50 and 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and two levels of Zn (0 and 40 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) in each sex. At the first day of trial, chicks were randomly distributed in 36 boxes at the same condition until day 15. Then, the treatments were administered in a low dosage for acclimating of chicks to them. From day of 21, the main dose of treatments was used. The effects of DA and Zn and interaction between them on cholesterol concentration of plasma were significant (p< 0. 05). But the effects on concentration of growth hormone (GH) and 3 -glyceride of plasma were not significant. The maximum concentration of cholesterol in plasma was observed in male chicks administered 40 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> Zn and the minimum concentration was related to female chicks administered 50 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> DA. In this period, the main and interaction effects of all treatments on weight gain mean of chicks were significant. Also, Zn and DA and interaction of DAxsex improved feed conversion ratio (p< 0. 05). The results of this experiment confirmed the lipolytic effect of DA on plasma cholesterol and abdominal fat and also showed that consumption <b>of</b> 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> DA plus 40 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> Zn cause to improve growth performance of male chicks...|$|R
40|$|Diltiazem (DTZ) {{is widely}} used in the {{prophylaxis}} of hypertension and treatment of angina. The effects of DTZ and other calcium channel blockers on memory have been discussed with several procedures and different theories have been suggested. In the present study, the effect of DTZ on retention and retrieval of memory in young and aged mice was investigated by using the passive avoidance apparatus. For this purpose, after weighting, coding and classifying the mice, they were grouped as follow: test group received electric shock plus DTZ (10 and 30 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. p.), blank group received electric shock plus normal saline and control group received only electric shock. In all three groups delay time of leaving the platform for both retention and retrieval test of memory was measured. DTZ was administered immediately after receiving electric shock in the retention test, but in retrieval test DTZ was administered 24 h after receiving electric shock. The results indicated that 30 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> DTZ impaired retention and retrieval of young mice memory. The 30 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> DTZ enhanced retention while 10 and 30 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> it improved retrieval of aged mice memory...|$|R

Sixty F 1 generation adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 15 animals each. Group 1 received normal saline, group 2 : 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> lead acetate, group 3 : 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> lead acetate then 2. 25 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 each of Zinc (Chelated zinc) and Selenium (Sodium Selenium) and group 4 : 2. 25 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>of</b> zinc and selenium (Se+Zn). The duration of treatment was 56 days following which the animals were sacrificed on the 57 th day and the testes harvested and fixed in Bouin’s fluid. Pb induced toxicity can follow a mitochondria pathway involving Cathepsin D (CAD) or a cytoplasmic pathway involving p 53 (protein 53; a 53 KDa nucleolase), the most predominant form of cell death is apoptosis which can result from both pathways.
