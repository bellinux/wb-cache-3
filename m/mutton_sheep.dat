40|$|To examine healthy slaughter-age {{cattle and}} sheep on-farm for the {{excretion}} of Salmonella serovars in faeces {{and to identify}} possible risk factors using a questionnaire. The study involved 215 herds and flocks in the four eastern states of Australia, 56 with prior history of salmonellosis. Production systems examined included pasture beef cattle, feedlot beef cattle, dairy cattle, prime lambs and <b>mutton</b> <b>sheep</b> and animals were all at slaughter age. From each herd or flock, 25 animals were sampled and the samples pooled for Salmonella culture. All Salmonella isolated were serotyped and any Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were phage typed. Questionnaires on each production system, prepared in Epi Info 6. 04, were designed to identify risk factors associated with Salmonella spp excretion, with separate questionnaires designed for each production system. Salmonellae were identified in all production systems and were more commonly isolated from dairies and beef feedlots than other systems. Statistical analysis revealed that dairy cattle {{were significantly more likely}} to shed Salmonella in faeces than pasture beef cattle, <b>mutton</b> <b>sheep</b> and prime lambs (P < 0. 05). A wide diversity of Salmonella serovars, all of which have been isolated from humans in Australia, was identified in both cattle and sheep. Analysis of the questionnaires showed access to new arrivals was a significant risk factor for Salmonella excretion on dairy properties. For beef feedlots, the presence of large numbers of flies in the feedlot pens or around stored manure were significant risk factors for Salmonella excretion.

The analysis of documented papers that concerned these attempts showed that the animal genetic material used was composed of variable breeds from north Africa, Europe and USA (the Aragonesa, Ouled Djellal, Laucaun drairy sheep, Berrichone, Texel x Norvegian crossed ewes, Awassi x Merino, Blackheaded Moutton sheep x Blackheaded German <b>Mutton</b> <b>sheep</b> (BGM), Rhoen sheep crosses of BGM with Dorper sheep, Assaf, Chura, Merino, Texel, Suffolk, Boujaâd Moroccan breed).

A comparison of fourteen woolled sheep flocks and eight similar sized mutton flocks revealed 1) a slightly but insignificantly higher unit production cost for wool producers, 2) a 21 % but insignificantly higher net farm income per breeding ewe for woolled sheep, 3) a significantly lower tagging percentage for woolled sheep and 4) a significantly lower predation percentage for woolled sheep. The percentage of woolled sheep in the flock was a logit function of farm size, size of the irrigated (crop) area, tradition and terrain ruggedness, although the latter was not significant. Farmers in extensive grazing areas should take notice of woolled sheep’s ability to compete and the wool industry should pay attention to further improving the reproductive performance of this sheep type.

While fattening, feed intake was recorded and lambs were weighed weekly. Ile de France×Merinolandschaf and Texel×Merinolandschaf {{seem to be}} of greatest economic interest for intensive fattening because they showed the best feed conversion rate and energetic feed conversion rate. Only these crosses were significantly superior compared to purebred Merinolandschaf in feed conversion rate and also in daily body weight gain during the fattening period.
