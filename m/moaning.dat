5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while <b>moaning,</b> huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as <b>moaning.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, <b>moaning,</b> and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his <b>moaning.</b> He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and <b>moaning</b> from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

Seizures sometimes occurred before or during the coma. Many would be tossing, rolling, <b>moaning,</b> twitching, spasming or thrashing around.|$|E

25|$|Pain in contractions {{has been}} {{described}} as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps. Women are often encouraged to refrain from screaming, but <b>moaning</b> and grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain. Crowning may be experienced as an intense stretching and burning. Even women who show little reaction to labour pains, in comparison to other women, show a substantially severe reaction to crowning.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} that Martí established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is {{a language of}} the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of tearing up the heart, complaining and <b>moaning.</b> The prose is a service to his people.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the nocturnal courtship songs of male dwarf stonebashers, Pollimyrus castelnaui, from the Okavango River and its inland delta. We examined {{the question of}} whether the songs are sufficiently differentiated from those of its parapatric sibling species, the only recently discovered P. marianne from the Upper Zambezi River, to form a potential cue for mate choice. Both species vocalised two sound types in courtship, the <b>moan</b> and the grunt, which they combined into long songs in similar fashion. However, one sound type was clearly differentiated: while P. castelnaui <b>moans</b> were of a husky quality and composed of three or four broadband formants, P. marianne <b>moans</b> were more tonal, with a single spectral line dominating the first and any higher formants (and a smaller bandwidth BW− 10 dB for the dominant frequency of the first formant). <b>Moan</b> and Grunt Duration and the <b>moan</b> Pulse Group Period (mPGP) were longer, and the latter more variable, in P. castelnaui compared to P. marianne (range of mPGP: 10 - 30 ms in P. castelnaui, 7 - 16. 7 ms in P. marianne). P. castelnaui grunts were of longer duration and composed of more pulses than those of P. marianne. A single male from the contact zone between the Okavango and the Zambezi, the lower Kwando River, resembled P. castelnaui in <b>moan</b> BW− 10 dB but P. marianne in <b>Moan</b> Duration and mPGP. Both southern African species thus vocalise in a species-specific fashion. Since in both species several characteristics of both <b>moans</b> and grunts show high between- and low within-male variability, mate choice may be selective for individual high-quality males characterised by acoustic features. 1) Corresponding author’...|$|R

25|$|Since its closure, {{reports of}} unexplained clanging sounds, screams, and crying {{have often been}} {{reported}} in the prison blocks.

On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a heavy door swinging in C-Block, but found no cause for it; the door swinging continued on other nights.|$|E
