40|$|ABSTRACT: High inter- and intra-laboratory {{variability}} {{exists for}} the single-breath diffusing {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DL,CO) test. To detect small changes in diffusing capacity in <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> accurate measurements are essential. The present study assessed whether regular DL,CO simulator testing maintained or improved instrument accuracy and reduced variability in multicentre trials. The 125 pulmonary function testing laboratories that participated in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> for AIR 1 Inhaled Insulin validated and monitored the accuracy of their DL,CO measuring devices using a DL,CO simulator, which creates known target values for any device. Devices measuring a simulated DL,CO different from target by. 3 mL?min- 1 ?mmHg- 1 failed testing and were serviced. Device accuracy was assessed over time and with respect to differences in several variables. Initially, 31 (25 %) laboratories had a DL,CO device that failed simulator testing. After fixing or replacing devices, 124 (99 %) laboratories had passing devices. The percentage of failed tests significantly decreased over time. Differences in geographical region, device type, breath-hold time, temperature and pressure were not associated with meaningful differences in DL,CO device accuracy. Regular diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide simulator testing allows pulmonary function testing laboratories to maintain the accuracy of their diffusing capacity measurements, leading to reduced variability across laboratories in <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> {{evaluating}} two antibacterial regimens for the empiric treatment of suspected infection in febrile neutropenic cancer patients, a suboptimal response was noted among recipients of antibacterial prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Multivariate analysis identified TMP/SMX prophylaxis as a predictor of poor outcome independent of other variables such as classification of infection, marrow recovery, neutrophil count at first fever, indwelling central venous catheter use, and underlying disease. This effect appeared to be restricted to recipients of tobramycin plus ticarcillin (TT). TMP/SMX suppresses potentially pathogenic aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and allows colonization and subsequent infection by Gram-positive microorganisms against which TT-like regimens have limited activity. Recognition of this phenomenon may permit a more appropriate selection of antibacterial agents for the therapy of suspected infection in the neutropenic patient...|$|E
40|$|Frailty models {{adjust for}} between-cluster {{variability}} in survival data by including a cluster-specific random factor, the frailty term, in the Cox model. The frailty term acts on the hazard rate in a multiplicative way and {{is assumed to}} be constant over time. This assumption is questionable in some particular settings, e. g., in cancer clinical trials on chronic myeloid leukemia. We therefore relax this assumption and consider frailty models with time-varying frailties. Instead of working with hazard models, we rather model the log cumulative hazard function, making use of the mixed model framework, and introduce a time-varying random effect at that level. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method has acceptable size and power to detect time-dependent clustering. The method is applied to data from a <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Diabetes {{mellitus}} affects 9 % of the European {{population and}} accounts for 15 % of healthcare expenditure, in particular, due to excess {{costs related to}} complications. Clinical trials aiming for earlier prevention of diabetic nephropathy by renin angiotensin system blocking treatment in normoalbumuric patients have given mixed results. This might reflect that the large fraction of normoalbuminuric patients are not at risk of progression, thereby reducing power in previous studies. A specific risk classifier based on urinary proteomics (chronic kidney disease (CKD) 273) {{has been shown to}} identify normoalbuminuric diabetic patients who later progressed to overt kidney disease, and may hold the potential for selection of high-risk patients for early intervention. Combining the ability of CKD 273 to identify patients at highest risk of progression with prescription of preventive aldosterone blockade only to this high-risk population will increase power. We aim to confirm performance of CKD 273 in a prospective <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> and test the ability of spironolactone to delay progression of early diabetic nephropathy. Methods and analysis Investigator-initiated, prospective <b>multicentre</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trial,</b> with randomised double-masked placebo-controlled intervention and a prospective observational study. We aim to include 3280 type 2 diabetic participants with normoalbuminuria. The CKD 273 classifier will be assessed in all participants. Participants with high-risk pattern are randomised to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg once daily, or placebo, whereas, those with low-risk pattern will be observed without intervention other than standard of care. Treatment or observational period is 3 years. The primary endpoint is development of confirmed microalbuminuria in 2 of 3 first morning voids urine samples. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted under International Conference on Harmonisation - Good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) requirements, ethical principles of Declaration of Helsinki and national laws.
