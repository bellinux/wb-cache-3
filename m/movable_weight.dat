60|$|In these {{circumstances}} Mr Stevenson constructed a balance crane, which was fixed in {{the centre of}} the tower, and so arranged that it could be raised along with the rising works. This crane resembled a cross in form. At one arm was hung a <b>movable</b> <b>weight,</b> which could be run out to its extremity, or fixed at any part of it. The other arm was the one by means of which the stones were hoisted. When a stone had to be raised, its weight was ascertained, and the <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> was so fixed as exactly to counterbalance it. By this simple contrivance all the cumbrous and troublesome machinery of long guys and bracing-chains extending from the crane to the rock below were avoided.|$|E

The R9 is built on the R7 <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> technology by adding Flight Control Technology (FCT) which allows the player to adjust the face angle and loft/lie of the driver to correct the shot shape. Combined with the MWT, the flight control allows (in theory) for 75 yards of lateral shot adjustment (plus additional shot height adjustment due to the changing of the face angle), compared to the latest R7 series driver the R7 Limited which had only a 40 yards of lateral shot adjustment.|$|E

50|$|Kater {{found that}} making {{one of the}} pivots {{adjustable}} caused inaccuracies, {{making it hard to}} keep the axis of both pivots precisely parallel. Instead he permanently attached the knife blades to the rod, and adjusted the periods of the pendulum by a small <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> (b,c) on the pendulum shaft. Since gravity only varies by a maximum of 0.5% over the Earth, and in most locations much less than that, the weight only had to be adjusted slightly. Moving the weight toward one of the pivots decreased the period when hung from that pivot, and increased the period when hung from the other pivot. This also had the advantage that the precision measurement of the separation between the pivots only had to be made once.|$|E
50|$|The Kater {{pendulum}} {{consists of}} a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near {{each end of the}} bar. It can be suspended from either pivot and swung. It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing. In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the period timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed. The <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal. At this point the period T is equal to the period of an 'ideal' simple pendulum of length equal to the distance between the pivots. From the period and the measured distance L between the pivots, the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the equation (1) above.|$|E

50|$|Design {{work began}} on the Hi 21 {{at the start of}} 1942 in {{response}} to a RLM requirement for a multi-purpose training glider. It was to be capable of providing both basic and advanced flight training, including high performance flying, aerobatics and three-point landings. A retractable undercarriage and side-by-side seating to optimise the instructional process were specified. The majority of two seat gliders have had tandem seating, with the student's seat over the centre of gravity (c.g.) so that its occupation would not affect the trim. Since both occupants of the Hi 24 sat ahead of the wing leading edge for good visibility, this was not an option and it was decided to employ a variable sweep wing, moving its aerodynamic centre to the c.g., rather than shift the c.g. with <b>movable</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{structure}} for reducing vibratory airloading in a rotor blade with {{a leading edge}} and a trailing edge includes a cut out portion at the trailing edge. A substantially wedge shaped cross section, inertially deflectable tab, also with a leading edge and a trailing edge is pivotally mounted in the cut out portion. The trailing edge of the tab may move {{above and below the}} rotor blade. A torsion strap applies force against the tab when the trailing edge of the tab is above and below the rotor blade. A restraining member is slidably movable along the torsion strap to vary torsional biasing force supplied by the torsion bar to the tab. A plurality of <b>movable</b> <b>weights</b> positioned between plates vary a center of gravity of the tab. Skin of the tab is formed from unidirectional graphite and fiberglass layers.

5000|$|Gravity feed saws {{fall under}} their own weight. Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a <b>movable</b> {{counterbalancing}} <b>weight,</b> a coil spring with a screw-thread adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to door closer hardware whose dampering action keeps the door from slamming. Gravity feed designs are common in small saws.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, John Haven Emerson {{developed}} a mechanical assister for anesthesia {{with the cooperation}} of the anesthesia department at Harvard University. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyze the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon, but also paralyze the respiratory musclesIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples, the latter using an automotive wiper motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs. [...] Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, {{developed a}} ventilator which was entirely gas driven, and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power, and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, who manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.|$|E
40|$|A new {{gyroscopic}} {{method of}} active ride control on marine vehicles is presented. Gyroscopic stabilisation is selected because it acts entirely within {{the hull of}} the vessel while not requiring sufficient <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> to generate control moments. The new approach is capable of generating greater stabilising moments than existing gyroscopic systems. Physical experiments, using a modulation theory approach, on a ship model practically demonstrate that the specified system is capable of providing levels of ride control comparable with existing systems. Theoretical estimates of the system on full-scale vessels demonstrate its practical feasibility for application on small and medium sized vessels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} factors that {{influence}} the amount of side-spin imparted to a golf ball during impact with a driver. In general, the best golf drives are launched with minimal side-spin, producing a straight ball trajectory with maximum carry distance. During off-centre impacts, side-spin is generated due to a phenomenon known as the “gear effect. ” The extent of the gear effect depends on clubhead design parameters such as the moment of inertia and centre of gravity location. The bulge of a driver is a design feature implemented to counter-act the side-spin produced by the gear effect. In this investigation, an impulse-momentum impact model and an aerodynamic ball flight model are used to (i) {{examine the effect of}} the centre of gravity depth (distance from clubface) on ball trajectory during off-centre impacts, (ii) test the efficacy of <b>movable</b> <b>weight</b> technology, and (iii) optimize the bulge radius in relation to the clubhead's centre of gravity depth and moment of inertia. In the first study, it is qualitatively shown that side-spin increases linearly with increasing centre of gravity depth. In the second study, it is found that movable weights can {{have a significant effect on}} ball trajectory, especially at higher swing speeds. In the third study, a relationship between the bulge radius, centre of gravity depth, and moment of inertia is developed, and an equation for calculating the optimum bulge radius is fit to the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, non-inflammatory type of arthritis, {{which usually}} affects the <b>movable</b> and <b>weight</b> bearing joints of the body. It {{is the most}} common joint disease in human beings and common in elderly people. Till date, there are no safe and {{effective}} diseases modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) to treat the millions of patients suffering from this serious and debilitating disease. However, recent studies provide strong evidence for the use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in curing cartilage related disorders. Due to their natural differentiation properties, MSCs can serve as vehicles for the delivery of effective, targeted treatment to damaged cartilage in OA disease. In vitro, MSCs can readily be tailored with transgenes with anti-catabolic or pro-anabolic effects to create cartilage-friendly therapeutic vehicles. On the other hand, tissue engineering constructs with scaffolds and biomaterials holds promising biological cartilage therapy. Many of these strategies have been validated {{in a wide range of}} in vitro and in vivo studies assessing treatment feasibility or efficacy.

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{identify}} the most appropriate indicator to assess the balance in the sudden perturbation test conditions. Methods: In this study, 13 freestyle national wrestlers at the age of 20. 5 ± 2. 4 and 13 normal subjects with average age of 23. 5 ± 1. 4 were used recruited. Balancing test was carried out under two conditions: standing with the guard (guard) and stand feet shoulder width apart (standing). To measure the balance parameters, the RS-scan system was used, and for external perturbation <b>movable</b> plant with <b>weights</b> equal to 12 % of the mass was used. The independent t-test for statistical analysis in each direction between the two groups was used. Results: Center of pressure (CoP) travel distance in the anterior, posterior and external directions, wrestlers were more than those in normal individuals in both positions; for guard position (p = 0. 01, p = 0. 01, p = 0. 5) and (p = 0. 2, p = 0. 5, p = 0. 01) in stand position. The COP average speeds in the anterior, posterior and external directions in both conditions were more in wrestlers than that normal group, (p = 0. 01, p = 0. 08, p = 0. 01) in the guard position and (p = 0. 27, p = 0. 1, p = 0. 01) in the stand position. The wrestlers were able to get stable as soon as possible in both positions and in four direction (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Athletes in sudden perturbation want to reach equilibrium and stability in shorter time by increasing speed CoP. Thus it seems, time to stability can be a good indicator for balance evaluating...|$|R
