Empirical data on larval dispersal remain scarce, hindering the use of spatial management tools in efforts to sustain ocean biodiversity and fisheries. Here we document dispersal among subpopulations of clownfish (Amphiprion percula) and butterflyfish (Chaetodon vagabundus) from eight sites across a large seascape (10, 000 km 2) in Papua New Guinea across 2 [*]years. Dispersal of clownfish was consistent between years, with mean observed dispersal distances of 15 [*]km and 10 [*]km in 2009 and 2011, respectively. A Laplacian statistical distribution (the dispersal kernel) predicted a mean dispersal distance of 13 – 19 [*]km, with 90 % of settlement occurring within 31 – 43 [*]km. Mean dispersal distances were considerably greater (43 – 64 [*]km) for butterflyfish, with kernels declining only gradually from spawning locations.

We also find that patterns of community similarity across Canada are strongly related to patterns of habitat composition but not to differences in energy-related factors. Energy should still be considered significant but its main role may be through its effects on within-habitat diversity and perhaps, indirectly, on the sorts of habitats that may be found in a region.

To understand the nuanced nature of coastal forest avifauna, where there may be considerable overlap in assemblages of adjacent forest types, the concerted influence of regional landscape context and vegetative structural connectivity at multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> warrants investigation. Objectives: This study determined whether species compositions of coastal forest bird assemblages differ with regional landscape context or with forest type, {{and if this is}} influenced by structural connectivity patterns <b>measured</b> at multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> Methods: Three replicate bird surveys were conducted in four coastal forest types at ten survey locations across two regional landscape contexts in northeast Australia. Structural connectivity patterns of 11 vegetation types were quantified at 3, 6, and 12  km <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> surrounding each survey location, and differences in bird species composition were evaluated using multivariate ordination analysis. Results: Bird assemblages differed between regional landscape contexts and most coastal forest types, although Melaleuca woodland bird assemblages were similar to those of eucalypt woodlands and rainforests. Structural connectivity was primarily correlated with differences in bird species composition between regional landscape contexts, and correlation depended on vegetation type and <b>spatial</b> <b>scale.</b> Conclusions: <b>Spatial</b> <b>scale,</b> landscape context, and structural connectivity have a combined influence on bird species composition.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} the understanding of cost-effective nutrient abatement in the Baltic Sea. This is done under various assumptions about the underlying abatement measures available to the social planner, future changes in nutrient outflow caused by climate change as well as the impact of technical change on the cost of abatement. The thesis consists of three papers, which examines different aspects of cost effective nutrient abatement in the Baltic Sea. Paper I analyses the value of introducing mussel farming as an abatement measure for reduction of nutrients in the Baltic Sea. We aim at determining the value of mussel farming as an abatement measure taking alternative abatement <b>measures,</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> and different nutrient load targets into consideration. The result show that calculated marginal cost by mussel farm can be considerably lower than that of other abatement measures, but also relatively high depending on mussel growth, sales options and formulation of nutrient load targets. Paper II examines the impact of climate change, structural changes in the agricultural sector and demographic development on the cost of fulfilling the nutrient abatement targets in the 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). In paper II we apply a dynamic discrete model of control costs, which also takes the dynamics of nutrients in each marine basin into consideration. The results show that the main drivers of future nutrient loads work in different directions and that climate change may counter some of the increases in costs brought by structural change in the agricultural sector. The aim of paper III is to show the impact of learning-by-doing induced technical change on the costs of nutrient abatement in the Baltic Sea. Learning-by-doing is modeled in a reduced form through the abatement cost function. In this setting increased abatement leads to increased experience, which reduce the cost of abatement. The results show that learning-by-doing induced technical change can decrease costs substantially depending on learning rate...|$|R

Measures of overall echo intensity within patches were the most predictable and showed little change with scale.

40|$|Studies {{of effects}} of {{landscape}} pattern on population dynamics {{should consider the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> at which habitat connectivity varies relative to the <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> of the species' behavioral response. In this paper, I investigate {{the relationship between the}} degree of connectivity of wooded patches <b>measured</b> at different <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> and the colonization of these patches by nuthatch Sitta europaea populations. I used different threshold distances to calculate the degree of habitat connectivity. A threshold distance is the distance beyond which the probability of successfully bridging the distance by dispersing individuals is assumed to decrease rapidly. The sum of the degree of connectivity over all patches in a region provides a measure for the overall degree of connectivity. Based on this measure, I could first give an indication under what conditions species may experience effects of constrained dispersal in that region. Second, the degree of connectivity of the individual patches was related with the observed colonizations of these patches. The degree of habitat connectivity measured for threshold distances of ca 2. 4 - 3 km best explains the colonization probability of unoccupied patches. These threshold distances give an indication of the distances covered by dispersing nuthatches that led to successful colonizations...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnification}} {{effects of}} clustered matter produce {{variations in the}} image sizes and number density of galaxies across the sky. This paper advocates {{the use of these}} effects in wide field surveys to map large-scale structure and the profiles of galaxy and cluster sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation as a function of angular scale is computed and the signal-to-noise is estimated for different survey parameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well designed space-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise on scales of about 0. 1 arcminute to several degrees. Thus the clustering of matter could be <b>measured</b> on <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> of about 50 Kpc to 100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise is dominated by sample variance rather than shot-noise due to the finite number density of galaxies, hence the accuracy of the measurements will be limited primarily by survey area, sampling strategy and possible systematics. Methods based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions and the contrasts and complementarities are discussed. Future work needed to plan survey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification is outlined. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

At the scale of proglacial landscape, the amount of C and N in aboveground and belowground parts of vegetation, surface litter, and soil were significantly affected by the habitat (moraines vs hummocks), the relative age of the terrain after the deglaciation, and/or the vegetation. At another scale, we focused on mudboils {{as an agent of}} local disturbance in the vegetation and soil of the glacier foreland. The biomass and the amount of C and N in aboveground vegetation, surface litter, biological soil crust, and soil were generally increased with the stage of mudboils 2 ̆ 7 inactivation. Biomass, C, and N in aboveground vegetation and surface litter were generally greater at moraine than at hummock, whereas those in biological soil crust and soil were greater at hummock. Principal component analysis identified two pathways, xeric and mesic ones on moraines and hummocks, respectively, of C and N accumulation both at the two <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> These results suggested that the C and N accumulation was not linearly related to the time since deglaciation and that moisture condition, vegetation, and mudboil activity were locally important. カナダ高緯度北極に位置する氷河後退域において、植生および土壌の炭素・窒素の蓄積量を調べた。氷河後退域全域を対象とした調査から、植生の地上部と地下部、地表のリター、および土壌の炭素・窒素量は、立地の水分条件、氷河後退後の年代、および植生により差が認められた。また植生の地上部、地表のリター、生物土膜、および土壌の炭素・窒素量は、周氷河地形であるマッドボイルの不活性化の段階を経るにともない増加しており、マッドボイルの出現が植生と土壌の局所的なかく乱を引き起こすことが示された。主成分分析の結果、立地の水分条件が炭素・窒素量の蓄積パターンに影響を及ぼす主要因であることが明らかとなった...|$|R

We randomly assigned 50 plots in the mid-intertidal zone at each site to one of five treatments (n =  10 plots each) : an unmanipulated control, a polyculture plot that contained our three target seaweed species, and three monoculture plots. We manipulated diversity by removing all non-target species from monoculture and polyculture plots, then removing additional biomass from polyculture plots, proportionate to species' relative abundances, so that the average amount removed from monoculture and polyculture plots was equivalent at each site. At the largest <b>spatial</b> <b>scale,</b> all sites considered together, after accounting for region and site nested within region seaweed diversity had consistent, positive effects on seaweed cover. Diverse polyculture plots always had higher cover than was predicted by the average performance of the component seaweed species and usually had higher cover than even the best-performing component species. Diversity effects weakened and became less consistent at smaller <b>spatial</b> <b>scales,</b> so that at the scale of individual sites, diverse polycultures only performed better than the average of monocultures ~ 40 % of the time. Hence, our results indicate that weak and/or inconsistent biodiversity effects at the level of individual sites may scale up to stronger, more consistent effects at larger <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> Quantitative summaries of biodiversity experiments conducted at the scale of individual sites do not capture this spatial aspect of biodiversity effects and may therefore underestimate the functional consequences of biodiversity loss...|$|R

Although narrow in com-parison to other features in the shock profile, the ramp plays the most important role in pro-viding the necessary dissipation of the incident solar wind flow.

In this study, we evaluate the relative influence of, and interactions among, the amount of habitat and aspects of its spatial configuration on genetic differentiation in the pitcher plant midge, Metriocnemus knabi. Larvae of this species are found exclusively within the water-filled leaves of pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea) in a system that is naturally patchy at multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> (i. e., leaf, plant, cluster, peatland).

Among leaves and plants, genetic differentiation appears to be driven by female oviposition behaviors and is influenced by habitat isolation at a broad (peatland) scale.

Our objective was to determine which <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> of landscape measurement best describes the incidence of three bird species (Pyriglena leucoptera, Xiphorhynchus fuscus and Chiroxiphia caudata) in the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest and test if multi-scalar models perform better than single-scalar ones. Bird incidence was assessed in 80 forest fragments. The surrounding landscape structure was described with four indices <b>measured</b> at four <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> (400 -, 600 -, 800 - and 1, 000 -m buffers around the sample points). The explanatory power of each scale in predicting bird incidence was assessed using logistic regression, bootstrapped with 1, 000 repetitions. The best results varied between species (1, 000 -m radius for P. leucoptera; 800 -m for X. fuscus and 600 -m for C. caudata), probably due to their distinct feeding habits and foraging strategies. Multi-scale models always resulted in better predictions than single-scale models, suggesting that {{different aspects of the}} landscape structure are related to different ecological processes influencing bird incidence. In particular, our results suggest that local extinction and (re) colonisation processes might simultaneously act at different scales. Thus, single-scale models may not be good enough to properly describe complex pattern-process relationships.

We evaluate vegetation preferences by comparing where ele-phants are to where they are not. To control for the influence other landscape factors that may complicate this comparison, we use two different approaches for defining ‘‘counterfactual ” locations from which elephants are absent. We characterize vegetation using remotely sensed estimates of greenness. Greenness can be <b>measured</b> across large <b>spatial</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tropical rivers provide {{about 60}} % {{of the global}} {{transport}} of organic and inorganic carbon from continents to the coastal zone. These inputs combine with organic material from productive mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs to make tropical coastal ecosystems important components in the global carbon cycle. Carbon exchange has been <b>measured</b> over multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>scales,</b> ranging from the transport and fate of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal zone, export of organic matter to the open ocean, exchange of leaf litter between mangroves and adjacent seagrass beds, to movement of carbon (at a scale of meters) between adjacent saltmarsh and mangrove habitats. Carbon is exchanged directly as particulate or dissolved material, or through migration of animals or {{through a series of}} predator-prey interactions known as trophic relay. This chapter first examines riverine carbon inputs to the tropical coastal zone, and how this material is processed in estuaries. The mechanisms and extent of carbon exchange among tropical coastal ecosystems are then discussed, showing their importance in ecosystem carbon budgets, and the implications for faunal and microbial communities. ...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} marine nematode-algae interactions using a twofold approach: habitat provision by algae {{and the role of}} algal detritus in structuring nematode assemblages. Nematode assemblages living in algae on the south and east coast of Korea were compared using a hierarchical sampling design with those from the south coast of the British Isles in order to investigate nematode diversity and functional traits at different <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> (patch, shore, region and biogeographic realm). The cosmopolitan genus Corallina and Sargassum muticum, a native of Korea and an invader in the British Isles were investigated as algal habitat providers for nematodes. The species composition and functional traits of nematode assemblage in both species of macroalgae were significantly different at all <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> The alpha, beta and gamma biodiversity of nematodes in each macroalgae were also <b>measured</b> at all <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> The alpha, beta and gamma diversity of nematodes across four <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> in two different habitats are an alpha dominant relationship indicating random colonization and high species turnover at small scales. Nematode species composition and diversity on the wrack-loaded sandy shore were explored using field experiments. Mesh bags filled with three different types of macroalgae (brown, green and red) were used to test the effects of diversity of algal detritus on nematode assemblages involved in decomposition processes. The detrital treatments consisted of 10 combinations of macroalgae (monoculture, two and three species treatments), containing different proportions of algal material in order to test the impacts of detrital diversity on nematode assemblages. The density, diversity and species composition of nematodes in combinations of algae were higher than with single types of macroalgae. This indicated that the combination of two algae mixtures offered more favourable environments than the single species bags. Overall this thesis demonstrated the high diversity of nematodes inhabiting seaweeds and the role of detrital composition in driving nematode assemblages. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Research on polycentricity {{has focused}} {{increasingly}} on the multi-scalar functional organisation of polycentric urban systems. These {{studies have shown}} that the degree of functional polycentricity varies considerably across different <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> Moreover, functional polycentricity is linked to two distinct concepts: spatial integration and the balanced distribution of flows. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relation between these two concepts and to highlight the implications of this conceptual distinction for empirical research across different scales. The paper examines the connectivity field method developed to <b>measure</b> <b>spatial</b> interaction in polycentric urban systems. Using detailed commuting data, the feasibility of the method in <b>measuring</b> both <b>spatial</b> integration and the balanced distribution of flows across different scales is tested in a case study from southern Finland...|$|R
40|$|Dynamics {{of populations}} may be {{synchronized}} at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales,</b> indicating driving forces acting beyond local scales, {{but may also}} vary locally {{as a result of}} site-specific conditions. Conservation measures for fragmented and declining populations may need to address such local effects to avoid local extinction before <b>measures</b> at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> become effective. To assess differences in local population dynamics, we aimed to determine the demographic drivers controlling population trends in three remaining populations of the Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe in the Netherlands, as a basis for conservation actions. An integrated population model (IPM) was fitted to field data collected in each site in 2007 – 2011 to estimate fecundity, survival and immigration. Sites were 40 – 120 km apart, yet first-year recruits were observed to move between some of the sites, albeit rarely. All three populations were equally sensitive to changes in fecundity and first-year survival. One population was less sensitive to adult survival but more sensitive to immigration. A life table response experiment suggested that differences in immigration were important determinants of differences in population growth between sites. Given the importance of immigration for local dynamics along with high philopatry, resulting in low exchange between sites, creating a metapopulation structure by improving connectivity and the protection of local populations are important for the conservation of these populations. Site-specific conservation actions will therefore be efficient and, for the short term, we propose different site-specific conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|Bats are {{the second}} most speciose order of mammals {{in the world and}} perform a myriad of {{ecosystem}} functions. Population declines for many bat species are associated with rapid, human-induced ecosystem changes. Within this dissertation, I relate differences in community structure, probability of species occurrence, and roost tree selection to environmental variables <b>measured</b> at multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> across a gradient of agricultural intensity. To accomplish this, I explored more flexible statistical models for identifying bat echolocation calls to improve species identification accuracy. I found that more flexible statistical models such as neural networks offer improvements over traditional linear discriminant analysis when identifying bat species by their echolocation calls. I then developed models to relate changes in bat community structure to both important environmental variation and evolved species traits. For these analyses, I demonstrated a strong relationship between evolved species traits and an apparent tradeoff between two landscape-scale environmental measures: forest and urban area. I also constructed species-specific occurrence models using hierarchical Bayesian methods that accommodated my study 2 ̆ 7 s spatially hierarchical sampling design. Here, I again demonstrated a tradeoff between urban and forest environmental factors. However, I also demonstrated specific relationships for species at different <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> I examined forest interactions at a finer scale by studying bat roosting habits within forests. I applied discrete-choice analysis to elucidate summer roost selection criteria by three species of bat at two <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> within a typical home range. Here, I found bats selected older trees in forest areas with distinct overstory and midstory canopies. Finally, I explored the potential contribution of bats to forest ecosystems through the creation of nutrient peaks surrounding their roost sites. I concluded that large Myotis sodalis maternity roosts could cause a temporary nutrient peak surrounding their roost during seasonal periods corresponding to parturition and lactation. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we are {{interested}} in the following two questions: (1) how does perceived roughness correlate with physical roughness, and (2) how do visually and haptically perceived roughness compare? We used 96 samples of everyday materials, such as wood, paper, glass, sandpaper, ceramics, foams, textiles, etc. The samples were characterized by various different physical roughness measures, all determined from accurately measured roughness profiles. These measures consisted of spectral densities <b>measured</b> at different <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> and industrial roughness standards (Ra, Rq and Rz). In separate haptic and visual conditions, 12 naı¨ve subjects were instructed to order the 96 samples according to perceived roughness. The rank orders of both conditions were correlated with the various physical roughness measures. With most physical roughness measures, haptic and visual correspondence with the physical ordering was about equal. With others, haptic correspondence was slightly better. It turned out that different subjects ordered the samples using different criteria; for some subjects the correlation was better with roughness measures that were based on higher spatial frequencies, while others seemed to be paying more attention to the lower spatial frequencies. Also, physical roughness was not found to be the same as perceived roughness...|$|R
