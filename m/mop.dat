5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply <b>MOP.</b>|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA set of well-defined and quantifiably justified Measures of Performance (<b>MOPs)</b> {{is required for}} the armament and fuel tasks of a Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) as described in the Universal Naval Task List (UNTL). Well-defined <b>MOPs</b> are required because the current UNTL contains <b>MOPs</b> that are not relevant for the Battle Group Commander to effectively evaluate task performance at the CVBG level. These <b>MOPs</b> are incorporated in the CVBG's training plan and provide the Battle Group Commander a method to evaluate the CVBG's level of ability to perform the necessary tasks. This thesis proposes 37 <b>MOPs</b> and an application to subjectively evaluate the <b>MOPs</b> to determine which ones are well defined. The application also objectively evaluates the <b>MOPs</b> to determine how well they collectively measure task performance. The proposed <b>MOPs</b> are derived from the task descriptions and objectives found in the UNTL. They are subjectively scrutinized using the twelve criteria required by the UNTL and objectively evaluated using correlation analysis. A simulation is developed for each task to provide the data for the objective analysis. The results indicate that 25 of the 37 proposed <b>MOP's</b> meet the required criteria of being well defined and useful in measuring task performance. Based upon the developed application, it is recommended that the Naval Doctrine Command consider the 25 <b>MOPs</b> for inclusion into its revised UNTL[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

5|$|Until 17 July, the VRS {{continued}} its attacks aimed at retaking territory lost in Operation Tiger, gradually pushing the HV back towards Dubrovnik. On 23 July, the HV 1st Guards Brigade counter-attacked north of Zaton, pushing the VRS {{north and east}} towards Popovo field. The attack, codenamed Operation Liberated Land (Croatian: Operacija Oslobođena zemlja), failed to cut off a battalion of the VRS 472nd Motorized Brigade deployed to Bobani, and the 4th Guards Brigade had to be deployed to <b>mop</b> up the area. Although substantial parts of the territory gained during the attack were surrendered to the VRS, the operation strengthened the HV defences in the area by 8 August.|$|E

On 22 September, in the area of Sapotskin, the detachment engaged units of the Polish 101st and 102nd Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 110th Reserve Uhlan Regiment, and other units retreating from Grodno. Most of the Polish troops escaped into the forest because of the slow advance of the detachment. Around three companies of Polish troops were dispersed and several officers were killed, among them the Grodno defense commander, Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. The retreating Polish forces left mines behind them, which blew up four BT-7 tanks. Chuvakin's troops also lost 11 killed and 14 wounded.|$|E

These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E

These functional and implementational differences allow us to classify <b>MOPs</b> in two large families: behavioral and structural oriented <b>MOPs.</b> The former is mainly used to deal with behavioral issues and is mostly used in system approaches. The later is more used in approaches consisting in controlling languages and structural features.

5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed {{to take back the}} castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to <b>mop</b> up the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As a result of this process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E
5|$|From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive.

The division was out of combat in March. In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped <b>mop</b> up in the Ruhr area. On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, pushed to the Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest. After V-E Day, the division was on military duty in the Bremen enclave. It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.|$|E

After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced to <b>mop</b> up the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on.

The regiment subsequently proceeded to <b>mop</b> up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
