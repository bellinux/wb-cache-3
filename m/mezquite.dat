40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} analyzes 20 th and 21 st century border fictions that {{recreate the}} meaning of 1848 by disrupting the legacies of colonial modernity, in particular the territorial preoccupation of U. S. expansionism. The dissertation demonstrates that while the consequent border asymmetries have since dictated material formations and social imaginaries of the U. S. -Mexico border these are also challenged via what the dissertation names "trans-temporality. " This term refers to the crucial difference between the border deployed by colonial modernity {{in terms of a}} territory to be seized and administered, replete with its own unitary and self-affirming temporality, versus the ways that local border communities imagine and experience time. In order to make this argument, the dissertation reads counter-narratives that are border adaptations of four major modern literary formations, modernism, neopoliciaco detective fiction, postmodern metafiction and neorealism. The stakes in doing so are not only that these distinct re-conceptualizations of 1848 result in unique border adaptions of mainstream literary styles but also how these create the possibility of examining the non-territorial dimensions of space. In arguing for the significance of 1848 in the present {{within the context of the}} literary, this dissertation builds on and moves beyond the Chicano/a nationalist and post-nationalist fiction and scholarship, which pioneered the anti-colonial critique of 1848 by re-imagining the annexed territories as the Chicano/a homeland Aztlán. Further, this dissertation engages borderlands criticism, in particular Debra Castillo and María Socorro Tabuenca Córdoba, Claire Fox, and Jaime Javier Rodríguez. Significantly, the dissertation's contribution is developed by fully exploring the link between the anti-colonial critique of the legacy of 1848 and literary style. Specifically, the dissertation demonstrates that an interrogation of the colonialist logic underpinning the U. S. -Mexico border can actually be gleaned through an analysis of modern fiction. The dissertation shows that the selected border fictions are not only counter-narratives to the U. S. expansionist narrative but in fact generate new aesthetics. This process is revealed through comparative analyses between borderlands fiction [...] that is written by U. S. and Mexican-American authors [...] and fronterizo texts, written in and about Northern Mexico. Chapter One examines border modernism by comparing two works that narrate the clash between projects of colonial modernity, imperial modernization, and mexicano anti-colonial revolutions of the 1910 s, John Dos Passos's The 42 nd Parallel (1930) and Américo Paredes's George Washington Gómez (1990). In George Washington Gómez, set in a small-scale border region (South Texas), the conflict is between agricultural modernization and traditional border corrido culture, resulting in sharply defined inter-ethnic conflict. Conversely, in The 42 nd Parallel the focus is hemispheric. Mexico appears as central rather than peripheral to the U. S. as its modernizing project undergoes a qualitative and geographic shift towards trans-American scale, defined as much by imperial economic hierarchies as by cartography. Linking these texts is border modernism's adaptation of modernist representational techniques, in particular shifting narrative modes and non-chronological structures. Chapter Two examines Gabriel Trujillo Muñoz's neopoliciaco detective fiction <b>Mezquite</b> Road (1995) and "Tijuana City Blues" via what this dissertation terms the "Neo-Private Eye:" a product of the neoliberal border setting of the late 1990 s, who is not an autonomous detective but rather a figure for the grassroots pursuit of justice and its necessarily conditional relationship to the neoliberal blurring of the private-public dichotomy. Neopoliciaco border fiction thus challenges the core dichotomy of neoliberalism that private interest is the highest public good. In addition to exposing the state as a criminal apparatus the border neopoliciaco's critique of ratiocination counters the legacies of 1848 by showing how border asymmetries are as much a question of discourse and policy as they are territory. By detailing the private eye Morgado's investigation of fifties era urban legends, "Tijuana City Blues" foregrounds how the discursive ruse that private individualism is the highest public good effectively re-produces the border beyond the purely territorial. If "Tijuana City Blues" critiques economic progress narratives, <b>Mezquite</b> Road shows how U. S. and Mexican state law enforcement agencies protect and thus sustain neoliberal ideologies. By delineating the complex network of state agencies and border citizens in Mexicali, <b>Mezquite</b> Road illuminates how the persistence of the border as a state-sanctioned, and thus legal, geopolitical divider is reinforced, paradoxically, by flouting the law. Chapter Three analyzes Instrucciones para cruzar la frontera (2011) in which Luis Humberto Crosthwaite adapts the postmodern strategies of parody, metafiction and pastiche in order to show how the normalization of borders as unobstructed transit points conceals the racialized logic of securing border zones. Using the array of strategies noted above, the chapter shows that while the text portrays conditions in which the geographic space of multinational capital is flattened out and borders are less barriers than metaphors, it does so in the service of a historical critique. Thus the accent falls on border in "border postmodernism" not only because, as important as it is, Crosthwaite's text emphasizes the difficulties of south-to-north crossing from the perspective of Tijuanenses. Rather, it is the way in which the metafictional strategies in Instrucciones para cruzar la frontera mediate a historical context where the very presence of human life is perceived as a threat so imminently real, however imagined it may be in reality, that capital punishment actually becomes a rational measure precisely because of the U. S. claim to "security. " Chapter Four analyzes the use of neorealism in Paul Flores's Along the Border Lies (2001) and Ana Castillo's The Guardians (2007) to show that analyses of border violence are flawed in perceiving the U. S. -Mexico borderline as a stable territorial referent. In defining neorealism, the dissertation draws on Kris Versluys, who identifies "mimetic prose" and "verisimilitude" as characteristic features, as well as Robert Rebein, who emphasizes the centrality of character experience. Specifically, the dissertation shows how the historical circumstances of border militarization and narco-trafficking are mediated by each text's implementation of the neorealist lack of closure in order to critique geographically based explanations of border violence. In Along the Border Lies, narco-trafficking occurs between San Diego and Tijuana, yet as the text foregrounds this traffic is less about physical borders than the non-spatial dimensions of border violence, registered stylistically through multi-perspectival narrative accounts. By rendering the character experience of drug trafficking on an increasingly militarized border without resolving a single plotline, the text suggests that border violence cannot be plotted exclusively through geography. Similarly, The Guardians portrays a series of abductions in the borderlands of New Mexico, Texas and Cd. Juárez. The difference however is that resistance to closure is not about unresolved plotlines but a limited interpretive capacity. By constructing an imagined world inhabited by characters where the object of their description, abduction, is in excess of their descriptive and analytic capacity, Castillo suggests an alternative vocabulary with which to revisit the paradigm that border violence is intertwined at both the individual and state levels...|$|E
40|$|I. Glacigenic {{deposits}} in the Death Valley region occur within the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak Formation. In the Panamint Range, immediately west of Death Valley, these strata are ≥ 1000 m thick and are continuously exposed for nearly 100 km along the strike of the range. Although these strata are variably metamorphosed and locally exhibit pronounced ductile strain, original sedimentary textures are well preserved throughout the range. Diamictic strata occur in two distinct intervals, a lower one comprising the Limekiln Spring and Surprise Members, and an upper one {{known as the}} Wildrose Sub-member of the South Park Member. Each of these intervals are succeeded by well defined cap carbonates, which, from oldest to youngest, are the Sourdough Member of the Kingston Peak and the Sentinel Peak Member of the overlying Noonday Formation. Between the two glacial successions, the Sourdough and sub-Wildrose South Park units comprise a 300 m thick interglacial succession that includes platform carbonate deposition. Sparse lonestones and striated clasts, along with the impressive lateral continuity of diamictic units, support a glacial origin. Chemostratigraphic profiles of δ 13 C through the Sourdough (- 3 ‰ to + 2 ‰, increasing upward) and Sentinel Peak (- 3 ‰ +/- 1 ‰) suggest correlation with the Sturtian and Marinoan caps, respectively. Potentially economic U deposits (secondary brannerite) occur in graphitic schists of the Limekiln Spring Member and sub-economic U and Th (hosted by detrital monazite) occur within quartz-pebble conglomerates in the South Park Member. The strata contain no fossils, radiometric age control, or primary magnetizations. II. The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian succession in the Death Valley region of SW Laurentia is among the best exposed and easily accessible in the world, and comprises {{one of the most}} complete sections in Laurentia. The largest single exposure of these strata occurs in the Panamint Range on the west flank of Death Valley, but this area has received little attention in comparison to numerous exposures to the east of Death Valley, primarily because of structural complexity and metamorphism. The eastern strata, although unmetamorphosed, occur in isolated fault-bounded exposures and are relatively thin and incomplete compared to the Panamint stratigraphy. These factors, combined with a lack of fossil or radiometric age control, has hindered confident regional correlation, as well as placement in the context of hallmark Neoproterozoic events observed in the South Australian, Namibian and other successions around the globe. New geological mapping, measured sections and high-resolution C-isotope data reported here from the Noonday Formation in the Panamint Range delineate its regional stratigraphic architecture and establish its age through correlation with section with radiometric age control. Carbon isotopic trends in the Panamint Range match to within 1 - 2 ‰ reproducibility previous results obtained for correlative strata in the eastern sections, indicating that metamorphism did not significantly alter C isotopic ratios. The combined lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data form the basis for a revised, more complete stratigraphic framework for the Noonday Formation. A composite section shows that, where most complete, the Noonday consists of three members, from the base upward, the Sentinel Peak, Radcliff, and Mahogany Flats members. New mapping and chemostratigraphic data permit robust regional correlation of a thin dolostone marker horizon {{at the base of the}} Noonday in the Panamint Range as little as 2 m thick (Sentinel Peak Member) with a tube-bearing microbial dolostone in the eastern Death Valley region more than 200 m thick. The data also reveal that the Radcliff Member is bounded by disconformable surfaces and their correlative conformities. These surfaces are recognizable throughout the region and are used to construct a regionally unified stratigraphic nomenclature. A key finding of this study is the construction of a chemostratigraphic profile spanning most of Noonday time. This was greatly aided by the discovery of carbonatebearing strata in the lower part of the Radcliff Member in the Tucki Mountain area of the Panamints, and relating their stratigraphic position to upper Radcliff and younger Noonday strata in the Wildrose Canyon area. The chemostratigraphic profile is a remarkable match for the Maiberg cap carbonate sequence in Namibia, including the decline to a minimum at - 5 ‰, a recovery to near 0 ‰, and then subsequent decline to - 2 ‰. Globally, profiles through many post-Marinoan sequences are either too condensed or lack sufficient carbonate to record these features, including the sections in the eastern Death Valley region. (Halverson et al. 2005). As such, the Panamint profiles represent the first relatively complete record of the post-Marinoan C-isotopic recovery outside of southern Africa. Correlation of these curves (1) firmly places the Noonday at the base of the Ediacaran Period, (2) indicates deposition of 200 m of Sentinel Peak and Radcliff strata occurred between 635 and 632 Ma, (3) supports the hypothesis that the Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation, which lies in sharp contact below the Sentinel Peak Member, represents at least part of the Marinoan glacial interval; (4) helps identify correlative cap carbonate sequences in key Laurentian sections, which include the Ravensthroat Formation in the MacKenzie Mountains, dolostones capping the upper diamictite of the Pocatello Formation in eastern Idaho, and the middle part of the Mina el <b>Mezquite</b> Formation in Sonora. The Noonday C-isotopic profile confirms that the details of relatively rapid, complex variations in ocean chemistry observed in basal Ediacaran strata in Namibia are globally reproducible. III. The Kingston Peak Formation in the Panamint Range represents the stratigraphically most complete section of Cryogenian strata along the SW margin of Laurentia. Two glacigenic diamictites and their associated cap carbonates, the older Surprise Member and Sourdough Member and the younger Wildrose Member and Noonday Formation (Sentinel Peak Member), provide timing constraints to bracket the inter-glacial succession to between ca. 713 Ma and 635 Ma, the ages of inferred correlative glacial cap carbonate rocks dated elsewhere. This timing constraint is further strengthened by the presence of a sharp decline in C isotopes in the Thorndike Member, which occurs immediately beneath the Wildrose Member; this decline is readily correlated with the global Trezona anomaly. Within the inter-glacial succession, new mapping in the northern Panamints has documented the presence of a previously unrecognised suite of coarse sedimentary rocks herein defined as the Argenta Member of the Kingston Peak Formation. The Argenta consists largely of poorly-sorted breccias and conglomerates containing an assemblage of gravel-sized clasts dominated by granitic gneiss, schist, feldspar augens, vein quartz and quartzite fragments, and locally carbonate rocks. These compositions indicate derivation from a basement provenance and record deposition in alluvial-fan to coarse-braided fluvial settings; their textural and compositional immaturity implies relatively short distances of transport. Mapping shows that the Argenta defines wedge-shaped packages as much as 200 m thick and that the base of the Argenta is a significant angular unconformity. Combined, these features are evidence that deposition occurred during a phase of extensional tectonism interpreted as recording the initial dismemberment of the Rodinia supercontinent. Best estimates place the timing of this tectonism at ca. 650 – 700 Ma. ...|$|E
