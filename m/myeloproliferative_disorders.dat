5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E

[...] Similarly, <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> in which the bone marrow produces too many blood cells, predispose to thrombosis, particularly in polycythemia vera (excess red blood cells) and essential thrombocytosis (excess platelets).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> is a hematologic {{abnormality}} {{characterized by}} an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow that primarily affects newborns and babies with Down syndrome. Tumor lysis syndrome is rarely associated with transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> Case presentation Transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> was diagnosed in a seven-day-old baby girl with Down syndrome, who was referred to our department due to hyperleukocytosis. Our patient developed tumor lysis syndrome, successfully treated with rasburicase, as a complication of transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> resulting from rapid degradation of myeloid blasts after initiation of effective chemotherapy. Conclusions Tumor lysis syndrome is rarely reported as a complication of transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of a newborn with Down syndrome and transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> treated with rasburicase for developing tumor lysis syndrome. </p...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML) is a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> that {{normally}} presents in middle-aged adults. Renal infiltration and extramedullary hematopoiesis in renal tissue has been rarely reported. This case report presents {{a patient with}} CML and renal insufficiency who developed gross hematuria. Efforts at controlling the hematuria led to a cascade of events propelled by the underlying disorder that ultimately led to a radical nephrectomy, multiorgan failure, and prolonged hospitalization. We suggest that management of gross hematuria in clinically stable patients with CML, suspected of having extramedullary hematopoiesis, should prioritize treatment of the <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> over efforts to control bleeding...|$|R

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} genomic DNAs from {{a patient}} who developed acute myeloid leukemia 1 year after a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> was diagnosed. The development of the acute leukemia {{was associated with the}} acquisition of a t(9; 11) (p 22;q 23) chromosome translocation. ALL- 1 gene rearrangement, on chromosome 11, was present {{at the onset of the}} acute phase, but not during the chronic phase of the <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> The genomic rearrangement on chromosome 9 was within an unidentified region. By the use of polymerase chain reaction, we were able to determine that the chromosomal rearrangement was completely absent during the chronic phase of the <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder,</b> indicating that the ALL- 1 gene rearrangement was causally related to the development of the acute phase. The rapid progression into the acute phase suggests that this case might be therapy related. This work provides a clear example of association of a molecular defect with the development of a specific clinical leukemic stage, and supports the indication that ALL- 1 gene rearrangement is associated with poor clinical outcome in adult leukemia...|$|R
