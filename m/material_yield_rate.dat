The results of the 144 fully completed questionnaires are analyzed by FA and then these results were utilized in second questionnaires design of 15 experts. Furthermore, {{the results of these}} second questionnaires were further analyzed by GRA in order to explore the most potential supplier’s selection determinants in the modern supply chain management (MSCM). Beyond a series of measurements, the measured results have induced three contributive findings: (1) the empirical interviewed industrialists reported concern that suppliers have to provide a higher <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> and material delivery on time rate for the qualitative increment as well as a higher supplier’s gross margin ROI for the financial stabilization in MSCM; (2) the 15 experts concluded that material insurance rate is an important attribute to estimate risky assessments and the supplier’s gross margin ROI and warehouse operations cost as a percentage of sales are critical elements in the financial evaluations of potential suppliers; and (3) Supplier’s gross margin ROI, outbound freight cost as a percentage of sales, and material insurance rate are the three most decisive determinants in MSCM...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{developed}} a GIS-based multivariate regression (MVR) <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> prediction model of groundwater resource sustainability in the hard-rock geology terrain of southwestern Nigeria. This model can economically manage the aquifer <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> potential predictions {{that are often}} overlooked in groundwater resources development. The proposed model relates the borehole <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> inventory of the area to geoelectrically derived parameters. Three sets of borehole <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> conditioning geoelectrically derived parameters—aquifer unit resistivity (ρ), aquifer unit thickness (D) and coefficient of anisotropy (λ) —were determined from the acquired and interpreted geophysical data. The extracted borehole <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> values and the geoelectrically derived parameter values were regressed to develop the MVR relationship model by applying linear regression and GIS techniques. The sensitivity analysis results of the MVR model evaluated at P⩽ 0. 05 for the predictors ρ, D and λ provided values of 2. 68 × 10 − 05, 2 × 10 − 02 and 2. 09 × 10 − 06, respectively. The accuracy and predictive power tests conducted on the MVR model using the Theil inequality coefficient measurement approach, coupled with the sensitivity analysis results, confirmed the model <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> estimation and prediction capability. The MVR borehole yield prediction model estimates were processed in a GIS environment to model an aquifer yield potential prediction map of the area. The information on the prediction map {{can serve as a}} scientific basis for predicting aquifer <b>yield</b> potential <b>rates</b> relevant in groundwater resources sustainability management.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{fabricate}} superconducting coated conductors with lower cost, fabrication processes are required high <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> We report an {{improvement of the}} <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> of YBCO films prepared by inside-plume Nd:YAG pulsed laser deposition method on metal substrates with an architecture of CeO 2 /LMO/IBAD-MgO/GZO/HastelloyTM. In this study, we shortened {{a distance from the}} target to the substrate (dT-S) in order to improve the <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> Additionally, we have used Nd:YAG laser because initial and running costs are anticipated to be lower than those of excimer laser. As a result, by shorting the dT-S from 40 mm to 20 mm, the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> increased on 10 mm× 10 mm substrates. Additionally, by changing the O 2 pressure (PO 2) from 40 Pa to 400 Pa at dT-S = 20 mm, the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> had a local maximal value of 18. 6 % at PO 2 = 200 Pa. On multi-turn (MT) metal substrates, the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> reached 56. 0 %. However, the critical current density (Jc) of the YBCO film which was deposited at dT-S = 20 mm and PO 2 = 200 Pa on the 10 mm× 10 mm substrate was 1. 2 MA/cm 2 at the edges and 0. 2 MA/cm 2 at the center at 77 K in self-field, although the YBCO films showed good aligned crystal textures. In order to improve this non-uniformity, we tilted the surface normal of the target 15 degree from a line connecting target and substrate. As a result, we achieved the uniformity in deposition rate. Then, we prepared YBa 1. 78 Cu 2. 9 Oy target to fabricate YBCO films with stoichiometric composition and obtained the uniform-high Jc...|$|R

50|$|Yield {{in college}} admissions is {{the percent of}} {{students}} who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission. It is calculated by dividing {{the number of students}} who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> for Princeton University was 69% in 2016, while the <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> for Dartmouth was 55%, and the <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> for Colorado College was 37%. The <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the Wall Street Journal by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the US News college ranking.|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the hydrological processes and the associated erosional responses on the purple soil slope. Based on a comprehensive survey of the Wangjiaqiao watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir, four typical slope gradients (5 °, 10 °, 15 °and 20 °) were applied to five rainfall intensities (0. 6, 1. 1, 1. 61, 2. 12 and 2. 54 mm·min- 1). The results showed that both surface and subsurface runoff varied greatly depending on the rainfall intensity and slope gradient. Surface runoff volume was 48. 1 to 280. 1 times of that for subsurface runoff. The critical slope gradient was about 10 °. The sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> increased with increases in both rainfall intensity and slope gradient, while the effect of rainfall intensity on the sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> was greater than slope gradient. There was a good linear relationship between sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> and Reynolds numbers, flow velocity and stream power, while Froude numbers, Darcy-Weisbach and Manning friction coefficients were not good hydraulic indicators of the sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> of purple soil erosion. Among the three good indicators (Re, v and w), stream power was the best predictor of sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> (R 2 = 0. 884). Finally, based on the power regression relationship between sediment <b>yield</b> <b>rate,</b> runoff rate, slope gradient and rainfall intensity, an erosion model was proposed to predict the purple soil erosion (R 2 = 0. 897).

40|$|For severe muscle damage, tissue {{engineering}} {{has become a}} viable option to culture muscle tissues with {{the ultimate goal of}} implantation. However, the tissues are typically cultured on permanent scaffolds which would elicit a foreign body response if placed in the body. To avoid this, biological scaffolds are ideal for tissue culture and limiting any negative reactions. A sacrificial scaffold can be used to gather extracellular matrix (ECM), which can then be used as the primary scaffold for culturing tissues for implantation. To reach the ultimate goal of implanting muscle tissue, an understanding of how to produce ECM on a larger scale must also be gained. Supplementing culture media with pro-fibrotic molecules is an option to consider for enhancing ECM formation. Two conditions, molecular crowding and the addition of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î² 1), were considered. In addition, the effect of the concentration of TGF-Î² 1 on <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> was also analyzed. In the first experiment, molecular crowding macromolecules, TGF-Î² 1, and a control with no additives were considered.. For the second experiment, concentrations of TGF-Î² 1 at 0. 5, 1, and 5 ng/mL were added to culture media and <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> was compared to a control set with no TGF-Î² 1. Cells were cultured for three weeks on sacrificial scaffolds under varied culture conditions, the scaffolds were removed, and the mass of ECM collected was measured. The <b>material</b> <b>yields</b> were then analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression. The results from the first experiment indicated that neither molecular crowding nor TGF-Î² 1 increase the <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> In the second experiment, it appeared that the addition of TGF-Î² 1 at all concentrations increased <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> This could indicate even less TGF-Î² 1 could be added to culture media to increase <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> Additionally, the amount of fetal bovine serum (FBS) added to the culture media was different between the two experiments, which could explain the conflicting results regarding the effect of TGF-Î² 1 on <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> in the two experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Electroporation through nanochannels has {{potential}} as {{a useful tool for}} cell transfection. This potential is due to: the low voltage required; the centralized distribution of the potential penetration; the fact that this method causes no harm to the cell membrane, and; the even expression pattern of the target gene after electroporation. Additionally, the stable production process and improved <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> can reduce the cost of producing the nanochannels and thus make the commercialization of this technique more feasible. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the speed of DNA stretching and the <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> of nanochannels.

In economic terms, relative changes in prices of different crops also may effect substitution. In the Indian context, rice, wheat, maize, millets and pulses are the major food crops. Oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute & mesta, and potatoes are the major cash crops. Tobacco, chillies, ginger, onion, turmeric, tapioca, sweat potatoes, etc. are minor cash crops. Among plantation crops tea, coffee and rubber are important. We observe that cereals and pulses occupy about 3 / 4 th of the gross area under cultivation. A clear trend in an increase in the percentage area under the cash crops is discernible. Plantation crops occupy a very small percentage (less than 1 %) of the total area under crops. Among the food crops, area under wheat has the highest growth rate followed by maize, rice and pulses in that order. The growth rate of area under millets is negative. Among the major cash crops, area under potatoes has grown fastest, followed by oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton and jute in that order.
