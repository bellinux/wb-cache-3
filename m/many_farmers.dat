5|$|In {{southern}} Chad, bitter {{conflicts over}} land {{are becoming more}} and more common. They frequently turn violent. Long-standing community culture is being eroded – and so are the livelihoods of <b>many</b> <b>farmers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gould {{noted that}} early Tasmanian {{settlers}} regarded the abundant green rosella highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He {{agreed that it}} was very tasty after trying it himself. <b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.|$|E
5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> {{in central}} Washington build dams on their {{property}} for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may {{be as many as}} a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E
5|$|Weaver and {{his wife}} moved their {{household}} in 1890 from Bloomfield to Colfax, near Des Moines, as the former Congressman took up more active management of the Iowa Tribune. The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in Des Moines where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since the Long Depression began in 1873. <b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> had joined the Farmers' Alliance, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate the public. Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.|$|E
50|$|Soil sample {{collection}} {{and interpretation of}} results {{is the subject of}} <b>many</b> <b>farmer</b> meetings held in different villages of the country. Educating farmers about soil {{sample collection}} and interpreting the analysis reports enables dissemination of accurate technical information up to the grass root level. Wide publicity to this kind of programmes is given through radio, newspapers and television.|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} were most severe on the Florida East Coast Railway, where at least 135 people died, 104 of them on Houseboat No. 4, one of the railway's boats. Many of the workers were swept to sea on barges and flatboats; however, the steamer Jenny rescued 42 workers, who were dropped off at Key West, while another 24 were sent to Savannah, Georgia. The railway's losses totaled about $200,000. Construction was disrupted {{for a whole year}} by the storm, as equipment was reassembled and repaired. <b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> on the Florida Keys suffered large losses; orange groves and fields of pineapples were devastated by the storm. Six lives were lost on plantations in the Keys. At the government wharf, the Fessenden was damaged during the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> have diversified; {{the average income}} from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900. Tourism-related activities accounted for much of this; these included bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering accommodation in redundant outbuildings or purpose-built units, bunkhouses for walkers and provision of food-related services in cafés, restaurants, farm shops, pick-your-own and farmer's markets. Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony trekking, mountain biking and many other activities. Caravans, camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land, and wind turbines can provide extra income from land still farmed in the normal way.|$|E
50|$|While all {{of these}} {{advances}} helped improve overall production of rice in Thailand, <b>many</b> low-income <b>farmers</b> in Thailand were left worse off. Many peasants were unable to hold onto to their land and became tenants. The government demanded tax revenues, even during bad years, and this pushed <b>many</b> low-income <b>farmers</b> even closer to the margin. New technologies also pushed up the entry cost of rice farming and made it harder for farmers to own their land and produce rice.|$|R
50|$|In winter <b>many</b> small <b>farmers</b> set up {{traditional}} ways of processing sugar cane. They extract its juice and add soda to produce molasses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> black <b>farmers</b> {{across the}} nation {{experienced}} discrimination in their dealings with U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies in their states. Across the nation, black farmers alleged, and the USDA later agreed, they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government. On a national level, farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers. Since they were denied government loans, emergency or disaster assistance, and other aid, <b>many</b> black <b>farmers</b> lost their farms and their homes.|$|R
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. <b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|The town {{began to}} develop after the {{completion}} of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.|$|E
5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for <b>many</b> <b>farmers.</b> In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period, overtaking wool exports {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Opportunities {{for farmers}} to {{supplement}} their farm income by working in industries such as quarrying or mining are largely no longer available. The financial burden has taken a toll on <b>many</b> hill <b>farmers,</b> causing them to exhibit signs of mental health issues. [...] <b>Many</b> hill <b>farmers</b> are forced to generate supplemental income outside their farms or to take out loans. [...] Because of these economic factors, there is little incentive for younger generations to continue on with the hill farming.|$|R

5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E

50|$|Grant farmed the White Haven {{property}} for his father-in-law, {{working with the}} slaves owned by Julia's father. Two more children were born, Ellen, born on July 4, 1855, and Jesse, in February 1858. Due to a financial panic in 1857, along with bad weather that destroyed <b>many</b> <b>farmer's</b> crops, Ulysses worked {{for a short time}} in the city of St. Louis in real estate and as an engineer. In 1860, Ulysses, Julia, and their four children moved to Galena, Illinois. Ulysses worked with his brothers selling leather goods made in their father's tannery.|$|R
50|$|Out of {{what was}} once purely a farming village with several well-to-do economists and <b>many</b> small <b>farmers,</b> and a {{relatively}} high number of craftsmen, grew a residential community for commuters, pensioners and employees in service industry occupations. Even the Flurbereinigung undertaken between 1968 and 1979, which cost a great amount (1,300,000 DM), could not stop agriculture’s downward slide. Only one agricultural operation in Ulmet - at an outlying homestead - still raises crops full-time. There are not even <b>many</b> part-time <b>farmers.</b> There was once livestock breeding, but that has been given up.|$|R
25|$|New South Wales {{suffered}} severe {{drought in}} 1812 and 1813, there was widespread loss of {{crops and livestock}} and by 1814 <b>many</b> <b>farmers</b> were close to insolvency because of the drought and ensuing depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> near Pinatubo began {{growing crops}} such as peanuts, cassava and sweet potatoes, which are quick-ripening and could be {{harvested}} before the threat of lahar floods during the late summer rainy season.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{crops in}} all of Queensland and all but the Riverina in NSW, which had needed some fine weather to finish, were almost {{completely}} destroyed by the excessive rainfall. <b>Many</b> <b>farmers</b> had no crop at all because of rust and many other crops were fed to cattle as their quality as grain was extremely poor.|$|E
