5000|$|This {{structure}} of the ignimbrite has been explained by magma chamber processes. Prior to the Purico ignimbrite eruption, a dacitic magma chamber already existed beneath the volcano. Probably after an injection of andesitic magma, dacitic contents of the magma chamber escaped upwards and formed the lowermost Lower Purico Ignimbrite. This injection of mafic magma rapidly increased the temperature and gas content of the dacite, causing the eruption to become a violent Plinian eruption {{with the development of}} an eruption column.

These facies can be explained by successively overlapping processes beginning in the <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> and ending with final deposition.

The four scales of facies result from four successive sets of processes: (1) differentiation in the <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> and external factors governing the mechanism of eruption; (2) temporal variations of factors inducing eruption column collapse; (3) physical conditions in the eruption column {{and the way in which}} its collapse proceeds; and (4) interplay of flow-inherent and morphology-induced transport mechanics...|$|E

Eruptions have been exclusively effusive, producing some 50 km 3 of high-K dacites and silicic andesites. Bimodal mineral compositions, complex mineral textures, {{the presence of}} andesitic magmatic enclaves within dacites and linear chemical trends on binary element plots all indicate that magma mixing is an important petrogenetic process at Uturuncu.

Experiments {{consisted of the}} continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0. 24 m diameter, 6. 5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient {{for a range of}} gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10 ^- 2 – 10 ^ 2 m/s), conduit diameters (100 – 2 m), and magma viscosities (3 – 300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the <b>magma</b> in the <b>column,</b> and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol. %), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103 – 104 m 3 /s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to {{a small fraction of the}} total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions...|$|R
30|$|In the conduit magma {{convection}} model, degassing occurs under {{low pressure}} {{conditions at the}} top of the convecting <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> and the dense degassed magma descends through the <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> where a volatile-rich less dense magma ascends from a magma chamber to compensate the descending magma (Kazahaya et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008). The low pressure degassing is consistent with the efficient H 2 O discharge from the H 2 O-poor magma at Shinmoedake. In contrast, the S-poor composition of the volcanic gas and the variation of the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio suggests that the degassing pressure of the Shinmoedake volcanic gases is higher than that at other persistently degassing volcanoes and changed with time (Figs. 7 and 8). However, quantitative evaluation of the degassing pressure for the S-poor composition is not possible due to the lack of the sulfur partition coefficient data.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{volcanic}} {{gas composition}} measured using a multicomponent gas analyzer system (MultiGAS; Aiuppa et al., 2005; Shinohara, 2005), SO 2 flux data, and petro-logical information, Shinohara (2013) {{suggests that a}} con-vecting <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> model best explains the degassing mechanism for Shinmoedake, probably occurring {{after the end of}} the lava accumulation stage. During the CV stage, an abrupt decrease of the flux of about an order of magnitude occurred in about one day (Fig. 2 (b)). To account for the decrease with the convecting <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> degassing model, abrupt decrease of conduit radius, increase of degassing depth, and change of magma properties should be considered. Because gas composition data support a shallow degassing depth of less than 500 m, at least after March 2011 (Shinohara, 2013), the increase of the degassing depth is not relevant. Such a sudden decrease of conduit radius might be possible by collapse of the conduit wall, but no geophysical evidence exists to support that inference. We presume that depletion of pre-erupted bubbles in the magma chamber is the key, at least for the large decrease of the flux. The density difference between a non-degassed magma and a degassed magma is greater, as well as the amount of gas lost per volume of magma during the convection is also greater for magma containing bubbles compared to those of magma without pre-eruptive bubbles. Because the density difference is the major driving force for the convecting <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> degassing model (Kazahaya et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008), the depletion of pre-eruptive bubbles in uprising magma can markedly slow the convection speed and accordingly decrease the gas flux.|$|E

40|$|Concepcion is a {{frequently}} active composite volcano in Nicaragua, and {{is located}} on Ometepe Island, within Lake Nicaragua. Significant eruptive activity took place at this volcano between March and May 2010, consisting of ash and gas explosions (VEI 1 - 2). We compare geodetic baseline changes observed with global positioning system (GPS), sulfur dioxide flux (SO 2), and seismic amplitude (SAM) data collected at Concepcion during April - June, 2010, and February - April, 2011. Time series analysis reveals a remarkable correlation among the data sets during 2010, when the volcano was erupting. In contrast, the volcano was at its background level of activity in 2011 and the statistical correlation among the time series is not significant for this period. We explain the emergence of correlation among the time series during eruptive activity through modeling of the GPS data with emplacement of a <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> in an open conduit. In the model, magma rose in the conduit, between May 5 and 14, 2010, from a shallow reservoir located at similar to 1. 8 km depth. Later, between May 24 and 31, 2010, {{the top of the}} <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> descended to almost 600 m depth, corresponding to the cessation of eruptive activity.

However, we could not find a clear correlation between observation of high CO 2 /SO 2 ratios and occurrence of explosions.

The results allow the identification of end-member deposits related to either pure magmatic activity, or pure phreato-magmatic activity. In addition, some deposits show evidence of the contemporaneous operation of both end-member fragmentation modes.

40|$|International audienceAn {{authoritative}} case of Vulcanian eruptive dynamics is {{the series}} of 88 explosions that occurred between August and October 1997 at Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat Island. The state of the magmatic column just before a Vulcanian explosion is still poorly understood, but conditions the eruptive style. This study establishes such a pre-explosive stratigraphy by 1) documenting the textures covering {{the range of the}} 1997 products, 2) quantitative analysis of H 2 O content in interstitial glass measured by Karl–Fischer Titration, and 3) combining these data with a simple model linking pre- and post-explosive vesicularities. The model shows that syn-explosive degassing affects greatly the way porosity evolves by decompression during an explosion. The stratigraphy reconstruction shows a three-part vertical layering of the conduit prior to explosion with overall denser values than those previously suggested. A dense and strongly degassed plug caps the column. It is underlain by a shallow transition zone featuring complex mingling between vesicular and dense magma up to 10 MPa. At higher pressure, up to 80 MPa, lies a more homogeneous zone of relatively dense (10 – 20 vol. %) magma, which was emplaced under partly open-system degassing. This conduit stratigraphy gives the vision of a strongly heterogeneous <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> immediately prior to its disruption. Our analysis suggests that fragmenting such a composite magma cannot happen in a single coherent pulse, but rather as stages. The transition zone contains heterogeneous amounts of exsolved gas that could explain the pulsatory nature of the Vulcanian jets {{at the beginning of the}} explosions. This contrasts with the nearly constant vesicularities of the deeper part of the pre-explosive <b>magma</b> <b>column,</b> which are propitious to a general, short-lived disruption...|$|E

30|$|Let us now {{consider}} the time {{evolution of the}} solution in Fig. 6. Lava starts to effuse at the observed eruption rate of 87 m 3 /s, and at an estimated magma chamber pressure of 1.5 × 108 Pa (point A). This is a steady solution, and, hence, no solution shift occurs {{as long as the}} boundary conditions stay unchanged. In real cases, however, the discharge rate steadily decreases toward point B, as does the chamber pressure because the chamber volume is finite. There are no steady solutions in the left-hand side of point B. After that, the processes must depart from a steady regime and further decrease in the chamber pressure due to ejection of magma inevitably results in the cessation of the eruption (i.e., the discharge rate goes to zero). The behavior of the system in the final processes is out of the framework of the present modeling. Qualitatively, extreme slow-down of the liquid phase, complete out-gassing in the conduit, compaction of the <b>magma</b> <b>column,</b> subsequent re-pressurization of the chamber (e.g., due to partial drain back), and achievement of a new pressure balance between the chamber and the denser <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> (i.e., another steady state with zero-flux), is a likely scenario. Since we assume the density of the crust to be 2, 500 kg/m 3, the final magma chamber pressure is also balanced to the lithostatic pressure. Accordingly, the magma chamber pressure at the termination of the lava extrusion is virtually regarded as the pressure at point B (i.e., 1.2 × 108 Pa). Therefore, the amount of pressure decreasing within the magma chamber, from the start to the end of lava effusion, is estimated to be 3 × 107 Pa.|$|E
40|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Mount Erebus {{is dominated by}} eruptive activity within a phonolitic summit lava lake. Common eruption styles range from passive degassing to Strombolian explosions, which typically occur several times daily, and occasionally in swarms of up to 900 per day. Shallow explosions, although generally the result of steady exsolution of volatiles from depth, can be triggered by surficial input of H 2 O through mass wasting of rock, snow and ice from the crater walls. Broadband observations of Strombolian explosions document very-long-period (VLP) signals with strong spectral peaks near 20, 12 and 7 s, which are polarized in the vertical/radial plane. These signals precede lava lake surface explosions by! 1. 5 s, are highly repeatable, and persist for up to 200 s. First motions indicate a deflationary source, with any precursory inflation being below the! 30 s passband of our instruments. Particle motions suggest a VLP source residing up to 800 m below the lava lake surface; however, this depth could be exaggerated by near-field radial tilt. Seismic and acoustic signals associated with lava lake explosions commonly show evidence for multiple bubble bursts in corresponding complexity features resulting from varying time delays and relative sizes of superimposed bursts. A systematic decrease in seismic/acoustic ratio for smaller surface explosions suggests that either the seismic energy from the smallest, shallowest bubble bursts experiences much greater seismic attenuation than energy arising from larger events which may involve a deeper, less attenuative portion of the <b>magma</b> <b>column,</b> and/or that the shallowest layer is seismically isolated from deeper parts of a stratified <b>magma</b> <b>column,</b> which are not excited by the smallest explosions due to sharp impedance contrasts across distinct layers.

The resulting data synergy allowed detailed insights into the conduit dynamics that drove the eruption and the transition back to the typical Strombolian activity. We present a direct link between gas flux, magma volume flux, and seismicity, supporting a gas driven model whereby the balance between gas flux and gas overpressure determines whether the system will support effusive or explosive activity.

30|$|Three {{proposed}} mechanisms {{exist for}} the source of excess degassing: pre-eruptive bubbles in erupted magma, degassing of a convecting <b>magma</b> <b>column,</b> and a permeable gas flow model (Shinohara, 2008). For Plinian eruptions, pre-eruptive gas bubbles in a magma chamber are the strongest candidate (Wallace, 2001; Scaillet et al., 2003). For effusive eruptions, all three mechanisms can cause excess degassing, but the likelihood of pre-eruptive bubbles is especially strong for those that immediately follow an explosive eruption (Shinohara, 2008). Regarding the 2011 Shinmoedake eruption, if one assumes that the contribution of pre-eruptive bubbles is the source of excess degassing for the lava accumulation stages, then the relative amount of pre-eruptive bubbles in the magma chamber was probably low compared to the eruptions of Mt. St. Helens (Bluth et al., 1993; Gerlach and McGee, 1994) and Redout (Gerlach et al., 1994) volcanoes, which had similar explosive eruptive sequences followed by effusive eruptions, {{with a high degree of}} excess degassing (greater than 8) for eruptions of both types (Shinohara, 2008).|$|E

Such high-porosity foam does not generate a stress on the liquid-rich layer because of its low density. Thus, the pressure at the dashed line can be close to atmospheric pressure, explaining the estimated low-pressure range of 0.2 – 20  MPa by gas observations (Shinohara et al. 2018 b). The thermal conductivities of foams are usually low, and the foam layer insulates the convecting liquid layer. The temperatures of the magma foam and <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> must approximately be constant. The pressure gradient within the foam layer is quite small, making it difficult to estimate the depth and thickness of the foam layer from the erupted products.

The decrease of the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio from March 15 to May 18 is likely due to a ten times increase of the degassing pressure, which agrees with the high-pressure degassing suggested by the S-poor composition on May 18, 2011. The H 2 O-poor composition of the Shinmoedake magmas, however, requires a maximum degassing pressure less than 1.2 MPa (< 500 -m depth), implying that the degassing pressure variation should occur at the shallow region of the magma plumbing system. Based on the SO 2 fluxes and the gas compositions, the conduit magma convection is considered as the gas supply mechanism at Shinmoedake, and the degassing pressure change is attributed to the change of depth of the convecting <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> top. The stable gas composition after May 18 suggests a stable condition of the conduit magma convection, although the eruption frequency decreased with time.|$|E
30|$|Fuego volcano {{is one of}} {{the most}} active volcanoes in Central America and erupts basaltic andesite, {{sometimes}} producing subplinian columns and pyroclastic flows that affect the local population (Rose et al., 1978; Lyons et al., 2010). Fuego has been continuously active since the onset of the preset period of activity which began with a VEI 2 eruption on May 21, 1999. Despite limited observations, HT has been frequently observed during temporary campaigns (Lyons et al., 2010, 2013). Lyons et al. (2013) observed SHT during a period of strombolian activity in June 2008 that include the effusion of short lava flows, while the following year SAHT was recorded during a period of mild vulcanian activity without associated lava effusion. In this case, the SHT-SAHT switching was associated with subtle changes in magma production rate, which led to a switch from strombolian to vulcanian activity. Lyons et al. (2013) propose that a lower magma production rate in 2009 led to degassing crystallization and an increase in the magma viscosity, thereby allowing the production of open degassing channels in the uppermost portion of the <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> and transmission of HT into the atmosphere.|$|E
30|$|Several {{generation}} mechanisms {{have been}} proposed for volcanic tremors, although a physical understanding of their origins has been elusive. Julian (1994) proposed a model in which oscillations of the channel were excited by a nonlinear process that occurred when magmatic fluid flowed through it. Chouet (1988) demonstrated that resonance induced in a fluid-filled crack by an impulsive pressure transient could explain many of the observed characteristics associated with long-period events and harmonic tremors. A magma-wagging oscillation against the restoring gas-spring force of the annulus around the <b>magma</b> <b>column</b> was modeled for volcanic tremors during a magma eruption (Jellinek and Bercovici 2011). The growth and collapse of bubbles as groundwater boils {{is thought to be}} a reasonable mechanism for harmonic tremors at geysers (Leet 1988). However, volcanic tremors accompanied by a phreatic eruption remain poorly understood. The installation of a dense network of seismic stations near the source of the signal is essential. A small phreatic eruption of the Hakone volcano provided an opportunity to address this issue, because seismic data were measured through such a dense network of stations that were installed near the eruption vents.|$|E
