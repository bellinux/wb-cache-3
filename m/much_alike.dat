When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906.

Wellesley (Captain George Goldsmith under Admiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a two-decker sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was {{how to handle a}} sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster at the rate of £5 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. Wellesley sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, <b>much</b> <b>alike</b> with others on board, never became ill or died.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the birthplace}} of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very {{important}} school of design was promoted by Raphael, whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the Vatican, and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so <b>much</b> <b>alike</b> is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.|$|E

50|$|Unlike herbivores, {{which tend}} to become highly {{specialized}} for particular ecological niches and diversify greatly in form, carnivores tend to be broadly similar to one another, certainly {{on the level of}} gross external form. Just as Northern Hemisphere carnivores like cats, foxes and weasels are <b>much</b> more <b>alike</b> in structure than, for example, camels, goats, pigs and giraffes, so too are the marsupial predators constrained to retain general-purpose, look-alike forms - forms which mirror those of placental carnivores.

Internationally, the album peaked inside the top 40 on charts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, New Zealand and Spain. It was certified Platinum in Brazil.

500|$|Hamilton {{became a}} clerk at local {{import-export}} firm Beekman and Cruger which traded with New York and New England; {{he was left}} {{in charge of the}} firm for five months in 1771 while the owner was at sea. He and James Jr. were briefly taken in by their cousin Peter Lytton; however, Lytton committed suicide. The brothers were subsequently separated. James apprenticed with a local carpenter, while Alexander was given a home by Nevis merchant Thomas Stevens.

However, [...] this allegation, mostly based on the comments of Timothy Pickering on the resemblance between the two men, has always been vague and unsupported.

She listed the ritual tools as an athame [...] "to raise or focus power", a binding cord for use in [...] "ritual liberation and unbinding", as well as a scourge [...] "to raise power", although the latter was never used to whip human beings. A chalice is used in rituals, symbolizing [...] "the yoni female receptacle of the life force", with an accompanying stone or wax phallus which is sometimes dipped into the chalice during rituals. A stone or wooden egg [...] "honors the cosmic egg which God held in her womb". Cora stated that in their rituals [...] "power is raised and used in magic operations for the good of our human race, our ecology, or for necessary martial purposes".|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Adjectives in {{definite}} Scandinavian DPs {{trigger an}} additional lexical determiner (double definiteness). In many cases, {{one of the}} determiners is obsolete, and {{in some of these}} cases, different readings are obtained. The presence or absence of weak adjectival inflection can also yield different readings, i. e. inflection interacts with interpretation. For Scandinavian DPs, I propose that the notion of definiteness is made up of three aspects: inclusiveness, reference, and identity and that these components are expressed by the preadjectival article, the suffixed article, and the adjectival inflection respectively. 1 Basic data (double) definiteness Standard Swedish, Norwegian, and Faroese very <b>much</b> pattern <b>alike</b> with regard to double definiteness: (1) a. bil-en car-the ‘the car’ b. den ny-a bil-e...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{technique}} of DNA fingerprinting, we investigated the genetic structure within and among four wild-caught colonies (n = 50 individuals) of a eusocial mammal, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber; Rodentia: Bathyergidae). We found that DNA fingerprints of colony-mates were strikingly similar and that between colonies they were <b>much</b> more <b>alike</b> than fingerprints of non-kin in other free-living vertebrates. Extreme genetic similarity within colonies is due to close genetic relationship (mean relatedness estimate +/- SE, r = 0. 81 +/- 0. 10), which apparently results from consanguineous mating. The inbreeding coefficient (F = 0. 45 +/- 0. 18) is the highest yet recorded among wild mammals. The genetic structure of naked mole-rat colonies lends support to kin selection and ecological constraints models {{for the evolution of}} cooperative breeding and eusociality...|$|R

[...] In addition, the Act of Abjuration, essentially the declaration of independence of the United Provinces from the Spanish throne, is strikingly similar to the later American Declaration of Independence, though there is no concrete evidence that one influenced the other.

Several of the characters, by which the hermaphrodite S. villosum so closely approaches, and almost blends into the genus Pollicipes,--such as the thicker cirri, with the intermediate tufts of bristles, the small second tooth of the mandibles, and the little brush-like prominence on the maxillæ,--are not in the least apparent in the complemental male.|$|R
40|$|An odd dissensus between {{confident}} metaphysicians and neopragmatist antimetaphysicians pervades early {{twenty-first century}} analytic philosophy.

But Lewis developed his system {{under the influence of}} his teacher Quine, inheriting from him his empiricism, his physicalism, his metaontology, and, I will show in this paper, also his Humeanism.

The tool we are developing is intended to stimulate the integration of software and hardware design tools into genuine CoDesign tools.
