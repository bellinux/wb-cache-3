Further, while there are three types of RTS: constant, decreasing and increasing (CRS, DRS and IRS, respectively), the classification according to GRS includes the fourth type of sub-constant GRS, which describes a DMU able to achieve its MPSS by both reducing and increasing the scale of operations.

40|$|The {{first four}} {{gravitational}} wave events detected by LIGO were all interpreted as merging black hole binaries (BHBs), opening {{a new perspective}} on the study of such systems. Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE, an upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography of merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass loss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the electron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss. We perform > 10 ^ 8 simulations of isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the impact of mass loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging BHBs. Accounting for the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor leads to the formation of black holes (BHs) with mass up to 65 Msun at metallicity Z~ 0. 0002. However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses 0. 6 are more likely. We predict that systems like GW 150914, GW 170814 and GW 170104 can form only from progenitors with metallicity Z<= 0. 006, Z<= 0. 008 and Z<= 0. 012, respectively. Most merging BHBs have gone through a common envelope phase, but up to ~ 17 per cent merging BHBs at low metallicity did not undergo any common envelope phase.

As a concrete example immediately relevant to analysis of initial and enhanced LIGO results, we use a nearby-universe catalog to demonstrate that no one tracer of stellar content can be consistently used to constrain merger rates without introducing a systematic error of order O(30 %) at 90 % confidence (depending on the type of binary involved).

The Sejm's 1777 decision was rather late effort to modernize Polish-Lithuanian cavalry, along the much earlier trend of evolution of European cavalry towards more modern organization of the cavalry regiments into more mobile formations. The most modern part of the reform was the establishment of some very modern battle dress uniforms for these cavalrymen, and in turn this uniform of the National Cavalry inspired numerous similar uniforms and employment of 'Polish lance' in the rest of Europe, notably the Austrian, Prussian, Russian cavalry, and later of the French cavalry of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|R
40|$|Calculating {{the galaxy}} merger rate {{requires}} both a census of galaxies identified as merger candidates, and a cosmologically-averaged `observability' timescale T_obs(z) for identifying galaxy mergers. While many have counted galaxy mergers {{using a variety}} of techniques, T_obs(z) for these techniques have been poorly constrained. We address this problem by calibrating three merger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and three galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs with a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M 20, and (3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A. Then we apply these timescales to the observed merger fractions at z < 1. 5 from the recent literature. When our physically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger rates become largely consistent. The remaining differences between the galaxy merger rates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by different techniques and differing parent galaxy selection. The major <b>merger</b> rate per <b>unit</b> co-moving volume for samples selected with constant number density evolves much more strongly with redshift ((1 +z) ^(+ 3. 0 ± 1. 1)) than samples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity ((1 +z) ^(+ 0. 1 ± 0. 4)). We calculate the minor merger rate (1 : 4 < M_sat/M_primary < 1 : 10) by subtracting the major merger rate from close pairs from the `total' merger rate determined by G-M 20. The implied minor merger rate is 3 times the major merger rate at z 0. 7, and shows little evolution with redshift. Comment: accepted by ApJ; 25 pages; 13 figures; 4 table...|$|R
40|$|Using mass-selected galaxy {{samples from}} deep multiwavelength data we {{investigate}} {{the incidence of}} close galaxy pairs between z= 0. 4 - 2. Many such close pairs will eventually merge, and the pair fraction is therefore related to the merger rate. Over this redshift range the mean pair fraction is essentially constant (evolving as f_pair (1 +z) ^{- 0. 4 +/- 0. 6 }) with about 6 +/- 1 % of massive galaxies having a 1 : 4 or greater companion within 30 h^- 1 kpc. Assuming the timescale over which pairs merge is not a strong function of redshift, this implies a similarly constant <b>merger</b> rate (per <b>unit</b> time) out to z= 2. Since about {{three times as much}} cosmic time passes at z< 1 as between z= 1 - 2, this implies that correspondingly more mergers occur in the low-redshift universe. When minor companions (1 : 10 mass ratio or greater) are included, the pair fraction increases to ~ 20 % and still does not evolve strongly with redshift. We also use a rest-frame color criterion to select pairs containing only quiescent galaxies (major "dry merger" progenitors), and find them to be similarly rare and constant with 4 - 7 % of massive quiescent galaxies exhibiting a nearby companion. Thus, even though other studies find major mergers to be relatively uncommon since z= 1, our results suggest that few additional mergers occur in the 1 <z< 2 range and other mechanisms may be required to explain the mass and size growth of galaxies over this epoch.

Although there is some degeneracy between fbin and alpha, the the fifteen high DRVmax systems that we find constrain the combination of these parameters, which determines a white dwarf <b>merger</b> rate per <b>unit</b> stellar mass of 1. 4 (+ 3. 4,- 1. 0) e- 13 /yr/Msun (1 -sigma limits). This is remarkably similar to the measured rate of Type Ia supernovae per unit stellar mass in Milky-Way-like Sbc galaxies. The rate of super-Chandrasekhar mergers is only 1. 0 (+ 1. 6,- 0. 6) e- 14 /yr/Msun. We conclude that there are not enough close binary white dwarf systems to reproduce the observed Type Ia SN rate in the 'classic' double degenerate super-Chandrasekhar scenario. On the other hand, if sub-Chandrasekhar mergers can lead to Type Ia SNe, as recently suggested by some studies, they could make a major contribution to the overall Type Ia SN rate. Although unlikely, we cannot rule out contamination of our sample by M-dwarf binaries or non-Gaussian errors. These issues will be clarified in the near future by completing the follow-up of all 15 high DRVmax systems.

The study included quantitative estimations, register data of sick leave, a time line of significant events and changes, and qualitative descriptions of employee appraisals of their work situation gathered through semi-structured interviews and open survey responses. Results: The work environment interventions were in general regarded as positive by the home care workers. However, all units were simultaneously subjected to substantial contextual instability, involving new work programs, new technology, restructurings, <b>unit</b> <b>mergers,</b> and management replacements, perceived by the home care workers to be major sources of stress. Findings suggest that concurrent changes induced through rationalization resulted in negative exposure effects that negated positive work environment intervention effects, causing an overall deteriorated work situation for the home care workers. Conclusions: Establishment and active utilization of communication channels from workers to managers are recommended in order to increase awareness of putative harmful and interruptive effects of rationalization measures. © Andersen and Westgaard; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2013.

40|$|Galactic bulges {{are known}} to harbour central black holes whose mass is tightly {{correlated}} with the stellar mass and velocity dispersion of the bulge. In a hierarchical universe, <b>mergers</b> of subgalactic <b>units</b> are accompanied by the amalgamation of bulges and the likely coalescence of galactocentric black holes. In these mergers, the beaming of gravitational radiation during the plunge phase of the black hole collision can impart a linear momentum kick or ``gravitational recoil'' to the remnant. If large enough, this kick will eject the remnant from the galaxy and populate intergalactic space with wandering black holes. Using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we investigate the effect of black hole ejections on the scatter in the relation between black hole and bulge mass. We find that although not the dominant source of the measured scatter, they do make a significant contribution and {{may be used to}} set a constraint, v_kick< 500 km/s, on the typical kick velocity, in agreement with values found from general relativistic calculations. Even for the more modest kick velocities implied by these calculations, we find that a substantial number of central black holes are ejected from the progenitors of present day galaxies, giving rise to a population of wandering intrahalo and intergalactic black holes whose distribution we investigate in high-resolution N-body simulations of Milk-Way mass halos. We find that intergalactic black holes make up only ~ 2 - 3 % of the total galactic black hole mass but, within a halo, wandering black holes can contribute up to about half of the total black hole mass orbiting the central galaxy. Intrahalo black holes offer a natural explanation for the compact X-ray sources often seen near the centres of galaxies and for the hyperluminous non-central X-ray source in M 82.

40|$|Within {{the next}} decade, ground based {{gravitational}} wave detectors are in principle capable {{of determining the}} compact object <b>merger</b> rate per <b>unit</b> volume of the local universe to better than 20 % with more than 30 detections. Though these measurements can constrain our models of stellar, binary, and cluster evolution in the nearby present-day and ancient universe, we argue {{that the universe is}} sufficiently heterogeneous (in age and metallicity distribution at least) and that merger rates predicted by these models can be sufficiently sensitive to those heterogeneities so that a fair comparison of models per unit similar star forming mass necessarily introduces at least an additional 30 % [...] 50 % systematic error into any constraints on compact binary evolution models. Without adding new electromagnetic constraints on massive binary evolution or relying on more information from each merger (e. g., binary masses and spins), as few as the {approx_equal} 5 merger detections could exhaust the information available in a naive comparison to merger rate predictions. As a concrete example immediately relevant to analysis of initial and enhanced LIGO results, we use a nearby-universe catalog to demonstrate that no one tracer of stellar content can be consistently used to constrain merger rates without introducing a systematic error of order 0 (30 %) at 90 % confidence (depending on the type of binary involved). For example, though binary black holes typically take many Gyr to merge, binary neutron stars often merge rapidly; different tracers of stellar content are required for these two types. More generally, we argue that theoretical binary evolution can depend sufficiently sensitively on star-forming conditions [...] even assuming no uncertainty in binary evolution model [...] that the distribution of star forming conditions must be incorporated to reduce the systematic error in merger rate predictions below roughly 40 %. We emphasize that the degree of sensitivity to star-forming conditions depends on the binary evolution model and on the amount of relevant variation in star-forming conditions. For example, if after further comparison with electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations future population synthesis models suggest all BH-BH binary mergers occur promptly and therefore are associated with well-studied present-day star formation, the associated composition-related systematic uncertainty could be lower than the pessimistic value quoted above. Further, as gravitational wave detectors will make available many properties of each merger [...] binary component masses, spins, and even short GRB associations and host galaxies could be available [...] many detections can still be exploited to create high-precision constraints on binary compact object formation models...|$|R
5000|$|American Piano Company (abbr. Ampico) was an American piano {{manufacturer}} eventually {{located in}} East Rochester, New York. The company {{was formed in}} a merger of Chickering & Sons of Boston, Wm Knabe & Co, of Baltimore and Foster Armstrong of Rochester, New York. It was formed {{in response to the}} increasing demand for player pianos, and, as well, the then current impetus towards larger economic entities and aimed at the achievement of economies of scale. The company was established in the period from 1907-1908 and in 1908 floated a prospectus and offering for shares under the name [...] "American Piano Company." [...] After the <b>merger</b> the individual <b>units</b> of the company, especially Chickering & Sons and Knabe continued production of their designs at their factories in Boston and Baltimore, along with lesser known lines. Design collaboration of the expertise of both factories, particularly, and, others as well, led to a refinement of designs and new products with more modern characteristics such as bent rims, more conventional actions, and, in general, more suitability for the addition of player mechanisms. In response to the increasing demand for smaller pianos Chickering had already been producing its line of [...] "quarter grands", introduced around 1902-3, enjoying robust sales of these lines as well. [...] The company flourished in the teens and early twenties, acquiring Mason & Hamlin in 1924, eventually, owning 9 piano factories scattered around {{the eastern part of the}} US and, building on the expertise of Chickering and Knabe, producing an impressive suite of modified designs, suitable for players. However, the demand for pianos began to rapidly weaken in the early twenties with the introduction of radio and electronic amplification of records, until then only of the acoustic, Victrola type. [...] Forseeing the ongoing collapse of the industry, the President of Ampico, a gentleman named Foster, sold his common stock to Bankers' Trust, retaining the preferred. Bankers' Trust installed its own president who altered the companies marketing plan. This substitution of the preexisting marketing approach, at that point sucessful, by the new one had a drastic effect, along with the contracting market, on sales, eventually resulting in bankruptcy for the company around 1928. These alterations are still considered in business schools to be a classic case of how to ruin a market franchise and still an example held up as a model of what not to do in business. [...] The company emerged from bankruptcy as the American Piano Corporation in 1929. As Foster's holdings were now only preferred stock he had a claim on the assets during the bankruptcy and was brought back to manage the company. Notwithstanding the crash of 1929, the company was profitable for the first two years of the new decade, but the complete crash of the economy as the depression depended forced it into bankruptcy again. A similar, large holding company producing pianos and players brought the company out of bankruptcy once more in a new entity known as the Aeolian-American Corporation and continued the process of consolidation of production in Rochester, New York. Aeolian-American continued in production until 1983 and was liquidated in a bankruptcy in 1985. From 1913 Ampico was one of the leading producers of reproducing pianos, the others being Duo-Art (1913) and Welte-Mignon (1905). The player piano and reproducing mechanism was designed by Charles Fuller Stoddard (1876-1958). A great number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), Leo Ornstein (1892-2002), Winifred MacBride, and Marguerite Volavy (1886-1951), recorded for Ampico, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th and early 20th century aesthetic and musical practice. By 1929 Ampico was in essential economic difficulties and was finally taken over by the Aeolian Company, a manufacturer of player pianos and organs. The combined company, known as Aeolian-American Corp., went through several ownership changes before declaring bankruptcy in 1985.|$|R
