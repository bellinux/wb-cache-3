50|$|The usual wiring has the {{positive}} (red) wire {{running to the}} terminal with a square profile, and the negative (black) wire running to the half-circle, half-square terminal. This is true for both genders of connector. The female sockets are in a male housing and the <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> are in a female housing. The <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> (female housing) connector is usually on the battery side.|$|R
40|$|Mating pair of {{insulators}} forces initial alinement of {{plug and}} socket. <b>Male</b> <b>pins</b> recessed {{behind one of}} alining insulators so they cannot touch female contacts alined. Contacts mate when coupling nut draws alined plug and socket together, depressing one of alining insulators against spring. Compressed spring provides tension on mated threads of assembly helping connector to resist loosening under vibration or shock. Arrangement prevents breakage or bending of <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> on conventional connectors when misalined contacts carelessly pressed together...|$|R

5000|$|A {{pin header}} (often {{abbreviated}} as PH, or simply header) {{is a form}} of electrical connector. It consists of one or more rows of <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> typically spaced 2.54 mm apart, but 5.08 mm, 5.00 mm, 3.96 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.27 mm or 1.00 mm are common as well. [...] The distance between pins is commonly referred as pitch in the electronic community.|$|R
50|$|Connectors usually {{consist of}} (i) a mating pair (plug and receptacle) each {{equipped}} with <b>male</b> (<b>pin)</b> or female (socket) contacts; note {{that at least}} one of the connector halves, or its contacts, should be floating to minimize mechanical stresses.|$|E
5000|$|The female RP-SMA {{connector}} has {{the same}} external housing as a standard or conventional female SMA connector, which consists of an outer shell with the threads on the outside; however, the center receptacle {{is replaced by a}} <b>male</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Powerlock {{connectors}} {{are designated}} as source or drain. The source connectors {{are intended to}} have their permanent connection {{in the direction of}} the source of electrical energy, and the drain connectors are intended to have their permanent connection in the direction of equipment receiving power. The role of male and female connectors is opposite to traditional usage in other designs of power connector - the Powerlock source connector has a <b>male</b> <b>pin</b> and the drain connector has a female receptacle. This does not however compromise safety because the gap between the plastic insulating cap on the <b>male</b> <b>pin</b> of the source connector and the surrounding plastic housing is too small to insert a human finger. The female drain connector also has a spring-loaded plastic cap to prevent casual contact with the electrical contact; however with sufficient pressure this can be displaced with a finger.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{especially}} in older computers, the colors differ. The pins are 0.200 in apart (center to center). The connector housing has chamfered corners {{on one side}} to prevent the user from plugging it in incorrectly. The connector that provides power (e.g., on a power supply) has female <b>pins</b> and a <b>male</b> housing; the connector that receives power (e.g., on a peripheral) has <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> and a female housing.|$|R

5000|$|The UEXT {{connector}} {{consists of}} 10 pins, in a two row by five <b>male</b> <b>pin</b> configuration, {{with a plastic}} keyed-shroud. All pins have a spacing of 0.1 inch (2.54 mm). [...] The socket is mated with a 2x5 (10-pin) IDC female connector, and typically connected to a Ribbon cable. The UEXT cable assembly {{is referred to as}} a 10-pin IDC Connector Ribbon Cable. These cables are readily available and cheap.|$|E
50|$|A {{closely related}} but {{different}} design {{is the so-called}} pin plug and matching pin jack. The pin plug designs resemble banana plugs, but without the spring on the <b>male</b> <b>pin.</b> Instead, these designs rely on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The pin plug design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin plugboards), or a very compact connector was needed.|$|E
50|$|Plug {{refers to}} the half of a {{connector}} pair designed to attach to a wire or cable; {{as opposed to the}} Receptacle half which is typically mounted to a bulkhead, panel or box. Even though plugs are usually thought of having <b>male</b> (<b>pin)</b> contacts, they can in fact house any type of contact—pins, sockets or even both. Therefore, it is the design and location of the connector which makes it a plug, not the gender of its contacts.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} D-sub connectors is ill-suited for consumer plug-and-play applications. Thin metal pins, especially in higher-density connectors, are easily bent or broken, particularly if frequently plugged in by touch behind equipment. The need to tighten screws for a secure connection is cumbersome. There {{is a high}} risk of shorting the <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> with the mating connector's surrounding lip as well. Although ESD- and EMI-resistant D-sub connectors exist, the fundamental design was never intended to protect from electrostatic discharge or electromagnetic interference or facilitate very high frequency interconnections.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial plugs {{that have}} a <b>male</b> center <b>pin</b> will have another measurement, Center Pin Diameter (CPD). These plugs are often used for higher power {{applications}} such as portable computers.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, many type N {{connectors}} are not labeled, {{and it can}} {{be difficult}} to prevent this situation in a mixed impedance environment. The situation is further complicated by some makers of 75 ohm sockets designing them with enough spring yield to accept the larger 50 ohm pin without irreversible damage, while others clearly do not, and expect users to segregate their connectors and adaptors. In general a 50 ohm socket is not damaged by a 75 ohm pin, but the loose fit means the contact quality is not guaranteed; this can cause poor or intermittent operation, with the thin 75 ohm <b>male</b> <b>pin</b> only barely mating with the larger 50 ohm socket in the female.|$|E
5000|$|A {{connector}} in a fixed {{location is}} a jack and a moveable connector is a plug. The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary {{compared to the}} cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug. Jacks use the reference designator prefix of J and plugs use the reference designator prefix of P. [...] It is possible {{in the case of}} box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with <b>male</b> <b>pin</b> contacts. In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.|$|E
50|$|All {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have longitudinal slits in the <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> {{that allow for}} compression when inserted into the female sockets to increase friction and therefore the mechanical security of the connection. A special tool appropriately called a pin splitter {{may be used to}} expand this slit and spread the two halves of the pin to compensate for wear. A knife may be used to the same effect, but this technique risks both personal injury, damage to the connector, or ruining of the knife blade. For these reasons, a flat-head screwdriver is often used as an impromptu pin splitter.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Adult female of Apiomorpha {{alongside}} a winged adult <b>male</b> on a <b>pin</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the {{stackable}} connector for electronics, which typically has <b>male</b> <b>pins</b> on one surface, and complementary female sockets {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|R
