50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held the}} {{mistress}} occupied the house under a bare licence, and had received an imperfect {{gift of the}} house. No trust could be inferred, but the encouragement to improve {{the house in the}} belief it was hers created a proprietary estoppel. A <b>mere</b> <b>licence</b> can be defeated by a sale of the house, so the husband would have to execute a conveyance, Dillwyn v Llewelyn (1862) 4 De GF&J 517, Inwards v Baker 1965 2 QB 29, and Crabb v Arun DC 1976 Ch 179 applied.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} an {{equitable}} easement passes with {{the transfer of}} the dominant tenement. Whether section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925 can operate to turn an equitable easement into a legal easement upon conveyance of the dominant tenement is unclear. On the one hand, it would seem odd that a <b>mere</b> <b>licence</b> could become a legal easement through the section, when the much closer equitable easement could not; on the other hand, construing the section in this way is unnecessary {{from the perspective of the}} purchaser, since a right enforceable in equity will be almost as useful as one enforceable at common law.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{affected}} {{property owner}} has standing {{to sue for}} a private nuisance. If a nuisance is widespread enough, but yet has a public purpose, it is often treated at law as a public nuisance. Owners of interests in real property (whether owners, lessors, or holders of an easement or other interest) have standing only to bring private nuisance suits. According to Oldham v Lawson [...] (where held that the husband has a <b>mere</b> <b>licence</b> and had no title to sue whereas his wife as owner did have title to sue) and some later cases, exclusive possession is necessary to establish a private nuisance case. However, one situation related to transform a private nuisance against land to one against person, this case is no longer considered to be authoritative.|$|E
5000|$|Fox LJ {{held that}} the lease bound Ashburn Anstalt. Rent was not {{necessary}} to create a tenancy, the occupation agreement was certain enough, and it was thus an overriding interest, {{as they were in}} actual occupation, and even though it was not registered as an estate contract, Street v Mountford. If they had only had a contractual licence, Arnold & Co could not have asserted its right against Ashburn Anstalt. Any suggestion in Errington v Wood that a licence creates an interest in land was wrong, according to Thomas v Sorrell. A <b>mere</b> contractual <b>licence</b> could not bind as a constructive trust without there being an express promise. It was doubted that a rent was necessary for having a tenancy, relying on Street v Mountford, but that Radaich was held to be the authoritative definition, and that did not include any mention of a rent. There would only be a constructive trust, continued Fox LJ, if, ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} {{the significance of this}} distinction in practise, imagine that an author writes a manuscript and sends it to a publisher for publishing. Imagine that the publisher buys the 'rights' to the book and gives an advance to the author, but then becomes busy with other projects and other priorities and decides to indefinitely postpone the publication of the book. Imagine that the author wants the book published and is very unhappy that his manuscript is rotting on a shelf somewhere and decides to take action and so sends the book to another publisher. At this stage, the legal consequences for the author will vary depending on whether the 'rights' sold to the first publisher were an assignment or an exclusive licence. If the rights are an assignment, the first publisher will get an injunction and the publication of the book will not go forward. However, if the rights were sold as a <b>mere</b> exclusive <b>licence,</b> then the author will have to pay damages to the first publisher, but the publication will go ahead nonetheless. This shows that authors who want to maintain some control over their works will probably prefer that the law maintains a distinction between assignments and exclusive licenses. However, it is clear from this example {{that in the case of}} an exclusive license, the damages award gives effect to the exclusivity which was violated by the original copyright owner.The decision in Euro-Excellence maintains the distinction between assignments and exclusive licenses.|$|R
40|$|Under no {{circumstances}} should the absurd "right to roam‟ {{be incorporated into}} the legislation of this country. In reality, it is clearly a <b>mere</b> <b>licence</b> to trespass. Armed with the appropriate economic and philosophical arguments, we should eventually be able to offer an effective counter-attack with a movement for the "right to own‟ privately every last one of the state-controlled commons, heaths, hills, mountains, downs, woodlands, rivers, beaches, and footpaths. As a result, there will be no imposition on legitimate landowners and more access to better resources for ramblers...|$|E
40|$|It is {{somewhat}} {{difficult to distinguish}} a conservative from a liberal position on free speech, especially in an Anglophone society which derives much of its conservative vision from Edmund Burke. In such a world, liberalism can be identified {{as the foundation of}} conservation, as it is liberal practices embedded in the way we do things that we wish to conserve. If there is a difference it {{lies in the fact that}} conservatives are far more likely to distinguish liberty from <b>mere</b> <b>licence</b> or licentiousness. They do not support an 2 ̆ 7 anything goes 2 ̆ 7 position but one in which, ideally individuals should exercise their freedom of speech in a responsible fashion, aware of the consequences of their actions and with future generations in mind...|$|E
40|$|Easement means, a right {{enjoyed by}} the owner of land over the lands of another: such as rights of way, right of light, rights of support, rights to a flow of air or water etc. The {{dominant}} tenement is the land owned by the possessor of the easement, and the servient tenement is the land over which the right is enjoyed. An easement must exist for the accommodation and better enjoyment {{to which it is}} annexed, otherwise it may amount to <b>mere</b> <b>licence.</b> An easement benefits and binds the land itself and therefore countinious despite any change of ownership of either dominant or servient tenement, although it will be extinguished if the two tenemants come into common ownership. An easement can only be enjoyed in respect of land. This means two parcels of land. First there must be a 'dominant tenement' and a 'servient tenement'. Dominant tenement to which the benefit of the easement attaches, and another (servient tenement) which bears the burden of the easement. A positive easement consist of a right to do something on the land of another; a negative easement restrict the use of owner of the serviant tenement may make of his land. An easement may be on land or on the house made on land. The next classification is on easement on the ground, and the other one under the ground. An easement shall be done in accordance with the principle of restrictions. This means that the less burden the servient tenement. When there is doubt about the extent of the actual easement shall take what easier the servient tenement. The new needs of the dominant estate does not result in the expansion of servitude. In the article is made comparison between The Draft Code of property and other real estate, and The Draft of Civil Code of Serbia...|$|E
