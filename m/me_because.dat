5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no reason}} to put my life on the line, and the lives of {{everyone}} who depends on <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> of a momentary loss of control..... I vowed to never allow myself to be {{in a situation like that}} again.|$|E

25|$|Still {{the best}} {{club in the}} world for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> it doesn't care about being the best club in the world. The guys do what they want, the way they want and it {{continually}} works. No VIP, no mirrors in the bathroom, no expensive cocktails, just a good sound system and great crowd.|$|E
25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with <b>me</b> <b>because</b> everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E

"It {{was given}} me {{as a child}} far away from here," [...] she answered, [...] "because in a mighty tempest the {{lightnings}} turned aside and smote <b>me</b> not; <b>because</b> the waters raged yet drowned <b>me</b> not; <b>because</b> the lions slept with me yet harmed me not. It came {{to me from the}} high Heaven that was my friend. I do not know how it came." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with <b>me</b> <b>because</b> they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

25|$|Langer impresses <b>me</b> <b>because</b> he {{has proven}} {{himself as a}} {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

500|$|I {{have faith}} in my fans. I believe they will come through for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> they always have.

500|$|Like Chapman, Schaefer {{is a fan}} of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{and said}} he began the script to try to {{understand}} [...] "how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. It was really {{different}} and weird for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. It was so fun to do {{and it was really}} out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But this time it was like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
