5000|$|As of 1973, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{standard}} for transponder <b>minimal</b> operational <b>performance,</b> <b>Technical</b> Standard Order (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with {{air traffic control}} radar beacon system (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called [...] "The Terra Problem", there have since been individual FAA Airworthiness Directives issued against various transponder manufacturers {{in an attempt to}} repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO, and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d was defined with tighter technical requirements.|$|R

40|$|Teamwork or {{collaboration}} among professionals, {{an important element}} of most R&D laboratories, has received little study in relation to <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> This study analyzes the relationship between individual perceptions of team collaboration and individual <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> in a research and development laboratory. Partial correlations are used to evaluate different models of causality between collaboration, individual needs, opportunities, need satisfaction and <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> The study concludes that the relationship between perceived team collaboration and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> is not direct. Rather, one particular aspect of collaboration, termed knowledge-based risk taking, creates greater opportunities for scientists and engineers to fulfill a variety of personal needs in the job setting, and these greater opportunities lead to higher <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> The study suggests R&D managers can promote greater opportunities for individuals to meet job needs and thus achieve greater <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> by encouraging a risk taking attitude toward innovation and a collaborative team process within technical work groups. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Failures in nontechnical and {{teamwork}} skills frequently {{lie at the}} heart of harm and near-misses in the operating room (OR). The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the impact of nontechnical skills on <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> in surgery. STUDY DESIGN: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO databases were searched, and 2, 041 articles were identified. After limits were applied, 341 articles were retrieved for evaluation. Of these, 28 articles were accepted for this review. Data were extracted from the articles regarding sample population, study design and setting, measures of nontechnical skills and <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> study findings, and limitations. RESULTS: Of the 28 articles that met inclusion criteria, 21 articles assessed the impact of surgeons' nontechnical skills on their <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> The evidence suggests that receiving feedback and effectively coping with stressful events in the OR has a beneficial impact on certain aspects of <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> Conversely, increased levels of fatigue are associated with detriments to surgical skill. One article assessed the impact of anesthesiologists' nontechnical skills on anesthetic <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> finding a strong positive correlation between the 2 skill sets. Finally, 6 articles assessed the impact of multiple nontechnical skills of the entire OR team on surgical performance. A strong relationship between teamwork failure and technical error was empirically demonstrated in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that certain nontechnical aspects of performance can enhance or, if lacking, contribute to deterioration of surgeons' <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> The precise extent of this effect remains to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{describe}} the association between chronological age, morphology, biological maturation and sport experience in relation to <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> in young Brazilian soccer players. Technical, maturation and anthropometric variables were assessed in 119 soccer players, 74 and 45 in the under- 15 and under- 17 categories, respectively. Data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model. Adiposity was negatively associated with <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> regardless the age-category. Weight was negatively associated with <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> in under- 15 and positively with the under- 17 category, respectively. In under- 17 biological maturation was negatively related to the dribbling test and positively associated with the ball control test. Years of experience proved to be positively associated with technique taught to soccer player in the under- 17 category. The explained variance was different between categories.

40|$|ObjectiveInterplay of {{baseline}} physiologic status, case complexity, <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> {{and outcomes}} in high-acuity operations has been poorly defined. This study explored these interactions {{to determine whether}} a technically optimal operation can mitigate effects of baseline physiology and high case-complexity on outcomes for the stage I Norwood procedure. MethodsTechnical performance was categorized as optimal, adequate, or inadequate from adequacy of the anatomic repair of the stage I subprocedures according to anatomic areas where intervention is performed. Physiological illness severity statuses in preoperative and postoperative periods were determined with Pediatric Risk of Mortality III system, which uses 17 physiologic variables. Case complexity was calculated with Aristotle comprehensive system. All patients undergoing stage I procedure from January 2004 to December 2007 were retrospectively studied. ResultsOne hundred thirty-five procedures were included. Five were excluded from the <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> assessment because of inadequate postoperative data. Eighty-one (62. 3 %), 26 (20 %), and 23 (17. 7 %), respectively, were scored as optimal, adequate, and inadequate. Overall hospital mortality was 14. 1 %. Inadequate <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> high-complexity Aristotle comprehensive scores, and high preoperative illness severity scores correlated with significantly higher hospital mortality, longer stay, and greater frequency of major postoperative complications. In subgroup analysis of patients with optimal <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> outcomes were favorable irrespective of high or low preoperative physiologic illness severity or case complexity. ConclusionsIn stage I Norwood procedures, optimal <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> attenuated effects of poor preoperative physiologic status and high case complexity, with reduced hospital mortality. Inadequate <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> resulted in poor outcomes regardless of preoperative status...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} was to define the relationship between surgical <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> score, intraoperative adverse events, and major postoperative adverse events in complex pediatric cardiac repairs. MethodInfants younger than 6 months were prospectively followed up until discharge from the hospital. <b>Technical</b> <b>performance</b> scores were graded as optimal, adequate, or inadequate based on discharge echocardiograms and need for reintervention after initial surgery. Case complexity was determined by Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS- 1) category, and preoperative illness severity was assessed by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score. Intraoperative adverse events were prospectively monitored. Outcomes were analyzed using nonparametric methods and a logistic regression model. ResultsA total of 166 patients (RACHS 4 - 6 [49 %]), neonates [50 %]) were observed. Sixty-one (37 %) had at least 1 intraoperative adverse event, and 47 (28. 3 %) had at least 1 major postoperative adverse event. There was no correlation between intraoperative adverse events and RACHS, preoperative PRISM III, <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> score, or postoperative adverse events on multivariate analysis. For the entire cohort, better <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> score resulted in lower postoperative adverse events, lower postoperative PRISM, and lower length of stay and ventilation time (P < . 001). Patients requiring intraoperative revisions fared as well as patients without, provided the technical score was at least adequate. ConclusionsIn neonatal and infant open heart repairs, <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> score {{is one of the}} main predictors of postoperative morbidity. Outcomes are not affected by intraoperative adverse events, including surgical revisions, provided <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> score is at least adequate...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and compare the <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> profile of the four-time Costa Rican Senior Basketball League {{championship}} team. A total of 142 games was recorded throughout the 2007, 2008 and 2009 seasons. Performance indicators selected were: two and three-point shots (converted, missed, effectiveness rates), free throws (converted, missed, effectiveness rates), points, offensive and defensive rebounds, fouls, turnovers, assists and ball steals. The information was described based on absolute and relative frequency values. Data was compared by season and by playing period based on the following non-parametric techniques: U-test, Friedman test and Chi-square. In all cases, SPSS version 15. 0 was used with a significance level of p ≤ 0. 05. Results showed a better profile of <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> in the 2008 season, characterized by better percentages of two-point shots, free throws, fewer turnovers and more ball steals and assists. In relation to the playing period, the team showed a better <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> profile during the second half of the matches. In general, the effectiveness rate of two-point shots and free throws was above 60 % in both playing periods, while the three-point shot percentage ranged between 26. 4 % and 29. 2 %. In conclusion, the team showed a similar <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> profile to that reported in the literature, as well as a clear evidence of the importance of recording and following up on <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> indicators in basketball...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>technical</b> and contextual <b>performance</b> is widely {{recognized in the}} Industrial/Organization Psychology literature (Sackett & Lievens, 2008). Less well-understood are the causal antecedents of performance in these domains and how those antecedents relate to each other. Motowidlo, Borman, and Schmit (1997) proposed that <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> is determined largely by cognitive ability, which acts through the mediator technical knowledge to influence <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> They also proposed that contextual performance is mainly determined by personality traits and that these traits influence contextual performance via the mediating variable contextual knowledge. Although prior research has examined some of the causal antecedents proposed by Motowidlo et al. (1997), no study has examined these four variables simultaneously, in addition to gathering information about performance criteria in the two domains. This study examined these six variables {{in a sample of}} medical students. In keeping with the verbiage used in the medical literature, students' contextual knowledge is referred to as professional knowledge and their contextual performance is referred to as professional performance. Medical students (N = 209) beginning their third year at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston completed measures of professional knowledge and the Big Five personality traits and consented to have their MCAT scores (a proxy for cognitive ability) and their first- and second-year course grades (grade point average; a measure of their technical knowledge) gathered for this investigation. Performance criteria consisted of attending physicians' ratings of students' professional and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> during their clinical rotations. Rotations were grouped according to whether they fell into the domain of Primary Care or the Specialties. Notable findings are summarized by a path analytic model. Agreeableness exerted a causal influence on professional knowledge (β =. 38) and Primary Care professional performance (β =. 14). Extraversion causally affected professional knowledge (β = -. 22). Professional knowledge accounted for variance in Primary Care professional (β =. 19) and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> (β =. 22). Openness to experience and conscientiousness influenced technical knowledge (β's -. 19 and. 25). Cognitive ability was directly related to technical knowledge (β =. 43) and Specialties professional (β = -. 21) and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> (β = -. 19). Technical knowledge was related to Primary Care professional (β =. 32) and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> (β =. 42) and also Specialties professional (β =. 46) and <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> (β =. 57).
