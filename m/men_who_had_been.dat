5|$|Starting in 1951, four <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Scouts at the 1933 World Jamboree {{encountered}} {{each other}} at Monterey. Joseph Szentkiralyi (who later Anglicized his name as St. Clair) hired Bánáthy. In 1956, Hungarian Paul Ferenc Sujan joined them at the School. In Monterey, they joined the Boy Scout movement, meeting F. Maurice Tripp.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the morning}} of 13 September 1942 Winter and Desranges were ordered to collect the bodies of the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed on the beach. Of the 11 men who went ashore, three were killed: Major March-Phillips, Sergeant Williams, and Private Leonard; four were {{captured}} (the seriously wounded pair Captain Lord Howard and Lieutenant Hall, with Winter and Desgranges); and four others had escaped.|$|E
5|$|A duel {{was fought}} on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied. Two weeks later, two other <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> quarrelling in the {{newspapers}} met on the moor to gain satisfaction. However, the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place.|$|E

He was promoted {{to the rank of}} SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS on 10 June 1944. On 20 July 1944 Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia and received a minor wound to his left thigh from the bomb blast. Fegelein often showed around the photographs of the hanged <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> executed {{as a result of this}} failed assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

5|$|Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 {{reported}} Kalākaua's tour expense {{appropriated by}} the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy {{for the education of}} the young <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{employing}} {{a system that}} returned men by units, or by employment categories, {{it was decided to}} utilise an egalitarian system that saw <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> away for the longest period of time being returned first. Due {{to the size of the}} forces deployed overseas—roughly 167, 000 personnel in France, Britain and Egypt—and the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they waited. In order to achieve this and to prepare the men for a return to civilian employment, a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped, several thousand soldiers took advantage of them.|$|E
5|$|She {{used her}} access {{to form a}} {{coalition}} of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council of Negro Affairs, but which {{came to be known}} as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{were unable}} to {{concentrate}} sufficient combat power to launch {{an assault on the}} position and consequently they were forced to withdraw after a fierce engagement during which both sides suffered a number of casualties, reluctantly leaving behind two <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot and could not be recovered due to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. Although they were most likely dead, a battalion-attack to recover the missing soldiers was planned by the Australians for the next day, but this was cancelled by the American brigade commander due to rising casualties and the need to utilise all available helicopters for casualty evacuation. The bodies of the two missing Australian soldiers were subsequently recovered more than 40 years later, and were finally returned to Australia for burial.|$|E
5|$|Deane was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911, {{after a period}} as house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was stationed in Meerut {{at the start of}} the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force, landing in Marseille in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the Western Front, where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers: his action earned him a mention in despatches. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in his battalion.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault on}} Luga was still {{underway}} when Manstein received orders on 10 August that his next task {{would be to}} begin the advance toward Leningrad. No sooner had he moved to his new headquarters at Lake Samro than {{he was told to}} send his men towards Staraya Russa to relieve the X Corps, which was in danger of being encircled. On 12 August the Red Army had launched an offensive with the 11th and 34th Armies against Army Group North, cutting off three divisions. Frustrated with the loss of the 8th Panzer and the missed opportunity to advance on Leningrad, Manstein returned to Dno. His counteroffensive led to a major Soviet defeat when his unit encircled five Soviet divisions, receiving air support {{for the first time on}} that front. They captured 12,000 prisoners and 141 tanks. His opponent, General Kuzma M. Kachanov of the 34th Army, was subsequently court martialed and executed for the defeat. Manstein tried to obtain rest days for his <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> constantly fighting in poor terrain and increasingly poor weather since the start of the campaign, but to no avail. They were ordered to advance to the east on Demyansk. On 12 September, when he was near the city, he was informed that he would take over 11th Army of Army Group South in Ukraine.|$|E
