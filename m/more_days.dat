5|$|The {{fighting}} in Nanking {{did not end}} entirely {{on the night of}} December 12–13 when the Japanese Army took the remaining gates and entered the city. During their mopping-up operations in the city the Japanese continued for several <b>more</b> <b>days</b> to beat back sporadic resistance from Chinese stragglers. Though Mufushan, just north of Nanking, was taken by Japan's Yamada Detachment without much bloodshed on the morning of December 14, pockets of resistance outside Nanking persisted for several <b>more</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds for a few <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven <b>more</b> <b>days</b> on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} {{a plethora of}} songs {{during and after the}} By the Way tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and Josh Klinghoffer, called Ataxia. The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days in the recording studio, they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, and spent two <b>more</b> <b>days</b> in the studio before disbanding. Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Bradley {{had sent}} two {{armoured}} combat commands against the German southern (left) flank. On 8 August, {{one of these}} (from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division) was attacking {{the rear of the}} two SS Panzer Divisions. Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> there was no further prospect of any German success. The Germans issued orders to go on to the defensive along the entire front, but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve, with some German forces retreating, and others preparing to hold their ground.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} its peak intensity, Zeke began to weaken once more due to increasing westerly wind shear. By {{the early morning}} of October30, the center of circulation became devoid of thunderstorm activity and the system had turned eastward. Later that day, Zeke weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low pressure system. The NHC continued to monitor the low-level swirl of clouds associated with Zeke for several <b>more</b> <b>days</b> as the system meandered several hundred miles south of Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After two <b>more</b> <b>days</b> without food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} {{that one of}} them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 20 November. Radford's force was occupied with air strikes on Japanese ground targets, and faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft in night combat, which U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for. He improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, {{and was later}} credited with establishing routines for nighttime combat air patrols to protect carriers; these were adopted fleetwide. He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa for several <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for a few <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty <b>more</b> <b>days</b> until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of the Mariana Islands, she received an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington, from October to November. After the overhaul, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces. She provided cover for two <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before retiring to the Palaus.|$|E

5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it. After several <b>more</b> <b>days</b> of the kids hating his music, Homer visits a music store and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but all he does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired {{as a part of the}} festival's freak show.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two <b>more</b> <b>days</b> to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the JTWC {{assessed}} Wukong {{to have reached}} its initial peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds). The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu {{later in the day}} before turning towards the west. On August16, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan. Wukong made landfall late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100km/h (65mph 1-minute winds). The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the Sea of Japan about 24hours after landfall. Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan, the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for two <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before dissipating near the Russian coastline.|$|E
