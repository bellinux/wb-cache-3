30|$|Although we call MMi {{the actual}} mail <b>month</b> <b>indicator</b> vector, {{it does not}} {{indicate}} the actual mail month for every observation, because a small share of Tickets were never mailed, and an even smaller share were mailed shortly after the rollout window (that is, after the last month represented in MMi). In coding MMi, we had to choose one of the rollout period mail months {{for each of these}} observations in order to keep them in the sample. For each case, we chose a virtual month that is assumed to be consistent with the individual’s actual behavior. For the bulk of such cases—those never mailed a Ticket because of benefit termination prior to their IMM—we used the actual IMM on the assumption that had SSA proceeded to mail their Ticket on their IMMs, their behavior would have been the same as their actual behavior. That seems very likely, because they would have received their Ticket after they could no longer use them, and a large majority were deceased. For the very small share of cases in which the Ticket was mailed {{a few months after the}} rollout ended (0.07 percent for Phase 2 and 0.19 percent for Phase 3, as shown in Table  2), we chose the last rollout month; that is, we coded these late mailing cases as if their Tickets were mailed a few months earlier than they were actually mailed.|$|E
40|$|Having {{accurate}} predictions {{on market}} price {{variations in the}} future is of great importance to participants in today’s electricity market. Many studies have been done on Short Term Price Forecasting (STPF). However, few works {{can be found in the}} literature with their main focus on predictions of electricity price in medium term horizon. Generally speaking, Medium Term Price Forecasting (MTPF) has applications where there exist markets for electricity with medium term contracts (e. g., forward/future contracts); Risk management and derivative market pricing, balance sheet calculations, and inflow of “finance solutions” are a few examples of these applications. The goal of this project is to predict the next 12 months monthly average electricity prices in the electricity market of Ontario and Nord Pool. To do so, mathematical models that are known to be capable of predicting series with acceptable accuracy using the limited number of samples available, such as Linear Regression Model (LR), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) are employed. First, different attributes of each market have been studied and the most informative ones, those that can better address future behavior patterns of the price, have been identified. Then, different input parameters designs for each model within each market have been examined. For example, the effect of previous month’s price, <b>month</b> <b>indicator,</b> Ontario demand, temperature and gas price is studied. For each market, different models’ forecasting results are compared and the most accurate ones are ranked for each market. Following this approach, 12 months ahead electricity prices in both markets have been forecasted. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for each model in each market is calculated by dividing the difference between forecasted and actual price of a month, by its actual price. In the case of Nord Pool different models have ended up to relatively similar results, with the WNN being the best with MAPE of 11. 95 % and LR the worst with MAPE of 17. 23 %. Due to more volatility characteristics of Ontario market, there is greater difference between different models results. Hence identification of appropriate model to predict the price in this market is of greater importance. In this market, the SVM with MAPE of 13. 17 % and WNN of 32. 95 % turn out to be the most and least accurate models, respectively. It can be concluded from the study that, in contrary to STPF, models that are only based on price data are incapable of capturing the price trends in medium horizon. The study results also show that different features on each model's performance in each market (e. g., inclusion of temperature data to predict the price of market of Nord Pool using the SVM) play roles with different degrees of significance in the results of the models. Ontario demand, for instance, is recognized as an important factor to be included in models to achieve acceptable results, whereas inclusion of temperature data into input features set of the LR model, deteriorates this model’s accuracy...|$|E

Death of outer cortical tissues and mortality of short roots is ubiquitous in conifers. Affected tissues lose their starch grains and accumulate secondary products, such as tannins. In this study, lo-year-old loblolly pine trees were cut at the soil surface and sequential samples of roots were collected, fixed, embedded, and sectioned for light microscopy at monthly intervals. Observations showed roots of felled trees {{were similar to those}} of standing controls for approximately 5 <b>months.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of cell and tissue death were the disappearance of starch grains, increased tannin accumulation, and decreased staining of nuclei. This pattern of changes was remarkably similar to that of dying cortical cells.

Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected on all cesarean deliveries over three <b>months.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of quality (antibiotic administration, use of oxytocin, decision-to-incision time, and uterine incision type) were compared to maternal morbidities (postpartum hemorrhage, fistula and wound infection) and neonatal mortality. Causes of delays in decision to incision time were identified. 513 cesarean deliveries were performed during the study period, with no maternal deaths and 39 neonatal deaths. Adherence to oxytocin and antibiotic administration was high but not complete, with greater adherence to the former (97. 1 % vs 82. 6 %). The decision to incision time between women with and without neonatal deaths was similar (1. 62 hours vs 1. 49 hours, p= 0. 41). Most delays were attributed to a busy operating theatre (49. 1 %) and delayed transfer to the operating theatre (26. 9 %).

Essential roles of antioxidant defense system for cellular redox regulation and free radical scavenging activity were described in this study. Many in vitro investigations have shown that turmeric (TE) and carrot seed extract (CSE) exhibits to possess antioxidant activities. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant potentials of ethanolic TE and CSE based on in vivo experiment in the rats. Methods: Animals were assigned to six groups: the 1 st and 2 nd groups were control groups and 2 nd group received 0. 2 ml dimethyl sulphoxide as vehicle treated group; other four experimental groups received different doses of TE (100, 200 mg/kg b. w.) and CSE (200, 400 mg/kg b. w.) by gavages, respectively {{for a period of}} one <b>month.</b> The <b>indicators</b> of oxidative stress, lipids peroxidation, markers of hepatocyte injury and biliary function markers were measured.

40|$|Assessment of {{proteins}} {{in blood and}} other tissues has failed to identify markers of early copper effects on health. Studies in animal models show that chaperone of SOD (CCS) respond to changes of copper status. Evidence about other copper chaperones (COXIV, ATOX) is not clear. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess by means of an in vitro challenge the mRNA relative abundance of ccs, sod 1, coxIV, mtIIa and atox in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs) obtained from healthy individuals, acutely and chronically supplemented with small-to-moderate amounts of copper. Healthy participants received 8 mg Cu/d (supplemented group, SG) or placebo, (placebo group, PG) for 2 <b>months.</b> Biochemical <b>indicators</b> were assessed at basal (T 0) and after 2 (T 2) and 60 days (T 60). At these times PMNCs were obtained, challenged with 1, 5 or 20 mu M Cu-histidine for 20 h and the mRNA relative abundance of the selected genes assessed by real time PCR. The results showed that at T 0, intracellular copper was not different between experimental and control groups. This increased at T 2 and T 60 when the copper in the media increased (two-way ANOVA, P < 0. 001). In PG, CCS mRNA transcripts showed no significant changes (two-way ANOVA) at T 2 and T 60. In SG, CCS changed by treatment, time and interaction (two-way ANOVA, all P < 0. 001). SOD, ATOX and COXIV expressions changed in both PG and SG showing various patterns of response, requiring further study. MTII responded as expected. We conclude that using healthy individuals as a human model, CCS but not SOD, ATOX or COXIV responded consistently to controlled changes of copper availability in an in vitro copper challenge.

40|$|Abstract:- In this article, {{we discuss}} the {{implementation}} of an Interactive Intelligent Decision System with emphasis on the multi-agent module. The system uses techniques of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, more specifically it adopts the cognitive multi-agent systems approach, requiring rule-based programming and human/computer interaction. The multi-agents were implemented using Java. Other purposes of this paper are: i) discuss how information obtained from users and from the market is dynamically processed and stored on a database, making all the process very adaptive; ii) show {{how to use the}} previous knowledge of economic analysts and how to represent this knowledge using frames and Common Lisp; iii) discuss the application of a combination of Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic to predict the evolution of stock prices of Brazilian companies traded on the São Paulo Stock Exchange; iv) present the obtained results. The network indicates if a trader would have to keep, sell or buy a stock using a combination of information extracted from balance sheets (released every three <b>months)</b> and market <b>indicators.</b> The results show that the network combining the previous knowledge of the economic analyst and other economic indicators can deliver good results depending {{on the quality of the}} available data...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{viability}} of oil sands aquatic reclamation techniques, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were stocked into three experimental ponds. Pond substrates consisted of either oil sands fine tailings or clay and lean oil sands deposited by the mining operations. Yellow perch were stocked immediately postspawning and subsamples were sacrificed at 5 and 11 <b>months</b> to measure <b>indicators</b> of energy storage and utilization. These indicators included survival, age, spawning periodicity, condition factor, gonad size, fecundity, and liver size. Indicators generally showed patterns consistent with improved energy storage and utilization in the experimental pond yellow perch as compared with yellow perch in the lake from which the stocked fish originated. This was evidenced by increased gonad size, condition factor, and Liver size and the disappearance of spawning periodicity. The patterns observed in experimental ponds suggest improved resource availability and (or) reduced intra- and interspecific competition. Yellow perch physiological indicators were also compared with those measured at several remote natural lakes in the area. Fisheries parameters measured in yellow perch from the experimental ponds generally fell {{within the range of}} those found in natural lakes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to monitor the growing intensity of the bulls of Czech Fleckvieh with subsequent evaluation of the quality of the carcass in a selected company in the Vysočina. There have been monitoring in the years 2011 - 2014 these indicators and inter-annual results: bulls housed an average of 293 pieces, increases amounted to an average of 35580, 76 kilograms in total, concentrated feed consumption averaged 2, 66 kg per ks. den- 1, concentrated feed consumption was of average 94667 kg total, average growth per day feeding 0, 99 kg, feed consumption per kg of growth reached an average of 2, 89 kg, an average of 94 bulls were sent to slaughter, with a total weight of 58, 987 kg and the average slaughter weight amounted to 633, 2 kg. Finally, evaluate the effect weight was 266 bulls for carcass quality, the average slaughter weight amounted to 715, 4 kg. As an indicator was chosen carcase weight, which amounted an average of 401, 9 kg. Furthermore, the average daily gain these monitored bulls amounted 0, 985 kg, and the average age at slaughter was 23 <b>months.</b> Another <b>indicator</b> of the level of conformation, which assigned a point value system amounted 3, 42. The degree of fat cover, which in the allotted scoring average value amounted 2, 12. Average entry into the class SEUROP these bulls was U 2. To evaluate the influence of slaughter weight of bulls on selected indicators of meat production was observed positive effect of increasing slaughter weight of bulls for carcass weight and conformation level carcasses. Fat cover of carcases different slaughter weights were not negatively affected. An interesting finding was a higher average daily gain of bulls slaughtered at higher weights. This indicates good genetic potential of animals on its suitability for fattening to slaughter weight higher, while achieving higher quality carcass (SEUROP favorable classification system and the higher financial profit for slaughter animal). In the company will still need to optimize ration, mainly to enhance the quality roughage feed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate potential clinical and MRI predictors of long-term outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This was a post hoc analysis using data from all 382 patients in the PRISMS long-term follow-up (LTFU) study collected up to eight years after randomisation. An additional analysis was performed including only those patients originally randomised to receive early subcutaneous interferon (IFN) β- 1 a (n[*]=[*] 259). Baseline/prestudy variables, indicators of early clinical and MRI activity (baseline to <b>month</b> 24), and <b>indicators</b> of IFN β- 1 a treatment exposure (including medication possession ratio (MPR)) were investigated as candidate prognostic factors for outcomes measured from baseline and from month 24 to LTFU. Explanatory variables identified from univariate regression models (p[*]≤[*] 0. 15) were selected for inclusion in stepwise multiple regression models. Results: Candidate prognostic factors selected by the univariate analysis (p[*]≤[*] 0. 15) included age, MS duration, baseline brain volume, EDSS score, and log(T 2 burden of disease (BOD)). In most of the multivariate regression models applied, higher baseline brain volume and MPR predicted better long-term clinical outcomes, while higher baseline and greater early increase in EDSS score predicted worse outcomes. Conclusion: Identification of markers that may be prognostic for long-term disability could help identify MS patients at higher risk of disability progression...|$|R
