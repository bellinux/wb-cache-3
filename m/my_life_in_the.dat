5|$|Besides {{his work}} as a {{theatrical}} theorist and director, Takechi occasionally appeared in acting roles on the stage and screen. In his series of essays, Chronicles of <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th Century, American author and translator of Japanese literature, Donald Keene mentions his own study of kyōgen at this time.

5|$|Byrne {{initially}} {{struggled with}} writer's block, but soon adopted a scattered stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for Remain in Light was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted {{with the help}} of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M. Talking Heads expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side-projects. The album was the last of the band's collaborations with Eno, though Eno and Byrne's <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts would be released the following year.|$|E
5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix of <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written {{but that did not}} have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.|$|E

5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E

500|$|Sanford {{was born}} in 1917 in Laurinburg, North Carolina, the son of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford, both of English descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist David Gergen and said that it [...] "probably saved <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. Boys who had been Scouts or {{had been in the}} CCC knew how to look after themselves in the woods.... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best." [...] The BSA recognized him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.|$|E
500|$|Ghosts I–IV is {{an almost}} entirely {{instrumental}} album, {{with only a few}} tracks containing sampled vocals. Reznor described the album's sound as [...] "the result of working from a very visual perspective—dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams." [...] PopMatters' review of the album compared its musical style to that of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, ultimately categorizing it as [...] "dark ambient". The review went on to describe the music as [...] "a tonal painting, a collection of moods and not all of these moods are good ones." [...] NPR compared the album to the music of Erik Satie and Brian Eno; Rolling Stones review to [...] Brian Eno, specifically the album's sound to the instrumentals of Another Green World (1975) and the rhythm collages of <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts (1981). Robert Christgau also compared the album to the work of Brian Eno, summarizing Ghosts sound as [...] "mental wallpaper".|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{recorded}} all the tracks, as {{they were}} after Belew had performed on them, in a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. The lyricist used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes {{in the style of}} Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer [...] "hearing nonsense". After the frontman was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were followed by the overdubbing process. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had been working on parts of <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts, was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

The following month, Inside Soap writer Sarah Ellis reported Anderson had confirmed her {{departure from the}} show. Moran and Halliwell said it was unknown whether Charlie would be killed off or move to The City. On 22 January 2012, The Daily Telegraph's Debbie Schipp reported Anderson had filmed her final scenes with the show in August and they would air later that week. Anderson said she was happy with her decision to leave Home and Away and [...] "throw <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and see what happens." [...] On screen, Charlie {{decided to move to}} the city with Brax, Ruby and Casey. However, {{at the end of the}} show's 23rd season, Charlie was shot twice by Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys), in revenge for her shooting dead his brother. Charlie was critically injured and rushed to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) later told Ruby that Charlie was being kept alive by a ventilator and that she would not breathe on her own again. Ruby was then left with the decision as to whether she should turn Charlie's life support off or not.|$|E
500|$|Neutral Milk Hotel {{formed in}} 1989 as an {{offshoot}} of Milk, a high school musical project of singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum, and the band was largely a Mangum solo project in the group's earlier days. The group {{was a part of}} The Elephant 6 Recording Company, a collective of musicians that includes, among others, notable indie rock bands The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, and Of Montreal. The 1993 single [...] "Everything Is" [...] was the band's first release, and it would later be reissued as an EP with additional tracks. The band's first studio album, On Avery Island, was released on the independent label Merge, and has sold a relatively high 5,000 copies. Afterwards, the band began to tour for the first time, and grew to include horns player Scott Spillane, multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, and drummer Jeremy Barnes. In 1998 the band released In the Aeroplane over the Sea on Merge, an album which has since {{become one of the most}} popular and acclaimed indie rock albums of the 1990s. Up until 2011's Ferris Wheel on Fire EP, the band had had no new releases since In the Aeroplane over the Sea, though Mangum has said [...] "I don't know what's going to happen, but I certainly want to make music a bigger part of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future than it has been for the last couple of years." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1970s work of ex-Roxy Music member {{musician}} Brian Eno {{is cited}} by Leigh Landy as an archetypal {{example of a}} pop musician who [...] "applied developments from the experimental sector while creating their own experimental pop sector." [...] Following his departure from Roxy Music in 1973, Eno began releasing a series of solo albums where he simultaneously developed his ambient, pop, and electronic styles. In the belief of pop musician Scott Miller, they were the era's [...] "most successful" [...] experimental pop artists, explaining {{that the key to}} Eno's success [...] "appears to have been making a science out of decision points (see 'Oblique Strategies') rather than being willfully weird or different at the usual unexamined decision points" [...] Joshua Pickard of publication Nooga profiled Eno's album Before and After Science (1977) as a record of [...] "experimental pop lucidity the culmination of sound that Eno had been working on since the release of Here Come the Warm Jets in 1973." [...] Members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster feature on the record as session musicians in addition to Phil Collins, who performs drums on one track. Collins' own debut solo single [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] (1981) has been described by Gary Mills of The Quietus as being [...] "at the vanguard of experimental pop" [...] when it was released. He further called it [...] "a rock oddity classic" [...] which was influenced by [...] "the unconventional studio predilections of Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel". Landy noted the tendency of experimental pop artists such as Eno and David Byrne to build tracks around existing recordings, effectively fusing different styles, a technique used on the duo's 1981 album <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bush of Ghosts.|$|E

500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his work-in-progress murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most certainly, I would have died. So the murals very directly saved <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way I could never have foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
