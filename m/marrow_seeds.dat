40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that complex interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment contribute to disease development, chemo-resistance and disease relapse. In {{light of this}} observed interdependency, novel therapeutic interventions that target specific cancer stroma cell lineages and their interactions are being sought. Here we studied a mouse model of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and used intravital microscopy to monitor the progression of disease within the bone marrow at both the tissue-wide and single-cell level over time, from bone <b>marrow</b> <b>seeding</b> to development/selection of chemo-resistance. We observed highly dynamic cellular interactions and promiscuous distribution of leukaemia cells that migrated across the bone marrow, without showing any preferential association with bone marrow sub-compartments. Unexpectedly, this behaviour was maintained throughout disease development, from the earliest bone <b>marrow</b> <b>seeding</b> to response and resistance to chemotherapy. Our results reveal that T-ALL cells do not depend on specific bone marrow microenvironments for propagation of disease, nor for the selection of chemo-resistant clones, suggesting that a stochastic mechanism underlies these processes. Yet, although T-ALL infiltration and progression are independent of the stroma, accumulated disease burden leads to rapid, selective remodelling of the endosteal space, resulting in a complete loss of mature osteoblastic cells while perivascular cells are maintained. This outcome leads to {{a shift in the}} balance of endogenous bone marrow stroma, towards a composition associated with less efficient haematopoietic stem cell function. This novel, dynamic analysis of T-ALL interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment in vivo, supported by evidence from human T-ALL samples, highlights that future therapeutic interventions should target the migration and promiscuous interactions of cancer cells with the surrounding microenvironment, rather than specific bone marrow stroma, to combat the invasion by and survival of chemo-resistant T-ALL cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Durable hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{engraftment}} requires efficient homing to and seeding in the recipient bone marrow. Dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms by retrospective analysis of functional engraftment studies imposes severe limitations on {{the understanding of the}} early stages of this process. We have established an experimental approach for in vivo functional imaging of labeled cells at the level of recipient bone marrow in real time. The adhesive interaction of hematopoietic cells with the bone marrow stroma evolves as the most important early event. Adhesion to the marrow, rather than the vascular endothelium, determines the efficiency of both homing and seeding, and is absolutely essential to maintain cell viability in the <b>marrow.</b> <b>Seeding</b> and engraftment may be improved either by bypassing homing or by localized transplant {{of a large number of}} cells in a relatively small marrow space. There is functional redundancy in the molecular pathways that mediate the cell-stroma interaction, such that blockage of a single pathway has only minor effect on homing and seeding. We hypothesize that successfully seeding-engrafting cells undergo extensive phenotypic changes as a consequence of interaction with the stroma, without engaging in rapid proliferation. Surprisingly, Fas-ligand appears to promote hematopoietic cell engraftment by immunomodulatory and trophic effects...|$|R
40|$|Thymic atrophy {{has been}} {{described}} as a consequence of infection by several pathogens and shown to be induced through diverse mechanisms. Using the mouse model of Mycobacterium avium infection, we show in this study that the production of NO from IFN-gamma-activated macrophages plays a major role in mycobacterial infection-induced thymic atrophy. Our results show that disseminated infection with a highly virulent strain of M. avium, but not with a low-virulence strain, led to a progressive thymic atrophy. Thymic involution was prevented in genetically manipulated mice unable to produce IFN-gamma or the inducible NO synthase. In addition, mice with a selective impairment of IFN-gamma signaling in macrophages were similarly protected from infection-induced thymic atrophy. A slight increase in the concentration of corticosterone was found in mice infected with the highly virulent strain, and thymocytes presented an increased susceptibility to dexamethasone-induced death during disseminated infection. The administration of an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptors partially reverted the infection-induced thymic atrophy. We observed a reduction in all thymocyte populations analyzed, including the earliest thymic precursors, suggesting a defect during thymic colonization by T cell precursors and/or during the differentiation of these cells in the bone marrow in addition to local demise of thymic cells. Our data suggest a complex picture underlying thymic atrophy during infection by M. avium with the participation of locally produced NO, endogenous corticosteroid activity, and reduced bone <b>marrow</b> <b>seeding.</b> The Journal of Immunology, 2012, 189 : 3600 - 3608...|$|R
40|$|Changes in T cell {{trafficking}} {{accompany the}} naïve to memory T cell antigen-driven differentiation, which remains an incompletely defined developmental step. Upon priming, each naïve T cell encounters essential signals–i. e. antigen, co-stimuli and cytokines– in a secondary lymphoid organ; nevertheless its daughter effector and memory T cells recirculate and receive further signals during their migration through various lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. These additional signals from tissue microenvironments {{have an impact}} on immune response features, including T cell effector function, expansion and contraction, memory differentiation, long-term maintenance and recruitment upon antigenic re-challenge into local and/or systemic responses. The critical role of T cell trafficking in providing efficient T cell memory has long been a focus of interest. It is now well recognized that naïve and memory T cells have different migratory pathways, and that memory T cells are heterogeneous with respect to their trafficking. We and others have observed that, long time after priming, memory T cells are preferentially found in certain niches such as the bone marrow or at the skin/mucosal site of pathogen entry, {{even in the absence of}} residual antigen. The different underlying mechanisms and peculiarities of resulting immunity are currently under study. In this review, we summarize key findings on bone marrow and tissue-resident memory T cells and revisit some issues in memory T cell maintenance within such niches. Moreover, we discuss bone <b>marrow</b> <b>seeding</b> by memory T cells in the context of migration patterns and protective functions of either recirculating or tissue-resident memory T cells...|$|R

The in vivo localization of B 220 $ sp+$ cells was revealed by the binding of i. v. injected $ sp{ 125 }$I-mAb 14. 8 detected by light and electron microscope radioautography of femoral marrow sections. Many B 220 $ sp+$ pro-B cells were located in peripheral regions of SCID and SCID/myc bone marrow, often in clusters, associated with an electron dense extracellular matrix and with the processes of stromal reticular cells. Many B 220 $ sp+$ cells were associated with macrophages which contained numerous ingested bodies. Macrophage associations were more numerous in SCID/myc than in SCID mice, especially in the peripheral marrow regions. 3 - 5 day post-irradiation endocolonizing marrow contained increasing numbers of B 220 $ sp+$ cells in subosteal and peripheral regions, situated both within sinusoids and extravascularly, associated with stromal reticular cell processes and often close to nerve fibers. The results demonstrate that early B 220 $ sp+$ precursors begin to differentiate in peripheral marrow regions and develop intimate associations with reticular cells and macrophages. These findings suggest that through these associations, the bone marrow reticular cells promote the early development of the B cell lineage, while the bone marrow macrophages {{play a role in}} the elimination of aberrant precursor B cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of two cell culture techniques, static and flow perfusion, on the osteogenic expression of rat bone <b>marrow</b> cells <b>seeded</b> into titanium fiber mesh for a period up to 16 days. A cell suspension of rat bone marrow stromal osteoblasts (5 x 10 (5) cells/ 300 microL) was seeded into the mesh material. Thereafter, the constructs were cultured under static conditions or in a flow perfusion system for 4, 8, and 16 days. To evaluate cellular proliferation and differentiation, constructs were examined for DNA, calcium content, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Samples were also examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and plastic-embedded histological sections. Results showed an increase in DNA from day 4 to day 8 for the flow perfusion system. At day 8, a significant enhancement in DNA content was observed for flow perfusion culture compared with static culture conditions, but similar cell numbers were found for each culture system at 16 days. Calcium measurements showed a large increase in calcium content of the meshes subjected to flow perfusion at day 16. The SEM examination revealed that the 16 -day samples subjected to flow perfusion culture were completely covered with layers of cells and mineralized matrix. In addition, this matrix extended deep into the scaffolds. In contrast, meshes cultured under static conditions had only a thin sheet of matrix present on the upper surface of the meshes. Evaluation of the light microscopy sections confirmed the SEM observations. On the basis of our results, we conclude that a flow perfusion system can enhance the early proliferation, differentiation, and mineralized matrix production of bone <b>marrow</b> stromal osteoblasts <b>seeded</b> in titanium fiber mesh...|$|R
40|$|Bone metastases are {{a common}} {{complication}} of epithelial cancers, of which breast, prostate and lung carcinomas are the most common. The establishment of cancer cells to distant sites such as the bone microenvironment requires multiple steps. Tumour cells can acquire properties to allow epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, extravasation and migration. Within the bone metastatic niche, disseminated tumour cells may enter a dormancy stage or proliferate to adapt and survive, interacting with bone cells such as hematopoietic stem cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cross-talk with the bone may alter tumour cell properties and, conversely, tumour cells may also acquire characteristics of the surrounding microenvironment, in {{a process known as}} osteomimicry. Alternatively, these cells may also express osteomimetic genes that allow cell survival or favour seeding to the bone <b>marrow.</b> The <b>seeding</b> of tumour cells in the bone disrupts bone-forming and bone-resorbing activities, which can lead to macrometastasis in bone. At present, bone macrometastases are incurable with only palliative treatment available. A better understanding of how these processes influence the early onset of bone metastasis may give insight into potential therapies.

Niche building and precursor homing are therefore intricately linked and should be viewed in context. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the developmental and genetic events that prepare the thymic epithelial microenvironment for its complex tasks, and highlight recent progress {{in the definition of}} the thymus-settling cells and the homing process that leads them into the thymus...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: To test {{in vitro}} and in vivo the {{capability}} of mesh materials to act as scaffolds for rat-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) and to compare inflammatory response and collagen characteristics of implant materials, either seeded or not with rMSCs. METHODS: rMSCs isolated from rat bone <b>marrow</b> were <b>seeded</b> and cultured in vitro on four different implant materials. Implants showing the best rMSC proliferation rate were selected for the in vivo experiment. Forty-eight adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two treatment groups. The implant of interest-either seeded or not with rMSCs-was laid and fixed over the muscular abdominal wall. Main outcome measures were: in vitro, proliferation of rMSCs on selected materials; in vivo, the occurrence of topical complications, the evaluation of systemic and local inflammatory response and examination of the biomechanical properties of explants. RESULTS: Surgisis and Pelvitex displayed the best cell growth in vitro. At 90 days in the rat model, rMSCs were related to a lower count of neutrophil cells for Pelvitex and a greater organisation and collagen amount for Surgisis. At 7 days Surgisis samples seeded with rMSCs displayed higher breaking force and stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of rMSCs reduced the systemic inflammatory response on synthetic implants and improved collagen characteristics at the interface between biological grafts and native tissues. rMSCs enhanced the stripping force on biological explants...|$|R

However, most experimental setups use silicone rubber substrates, which are atypical for orthopedic and dental implant materials. Therefore, we investigated the responses of osteoblast-like cells to loading on titanium (Ti) -coated versus plain silicone substrates. Ti-coated substrates were made by a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering process, and characterized using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact-angle measurements. Osteoblast-like cells cultured from rat bone <b>marrow</b> were <b>seeded</b> on both types of substrates and stretched for 1 h continuously. Subsequently, cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium content were measured for up to 24 days after seeding. In addition light-, scanning electron-, and confocal laser scanning micrographs were made. The results showed that our Ti coating had a thickness of 50 nm and contained Ti/oxygen as 1 : 1. However, further characterization proved that the silicone material had a tendency to resurface through the coating. Osteoblast-like cells proliferated faster on the Ti-coated substrates, but differentiation was slower compared with the silicone substrates. It was concluded that that there was a definitive influence of the substrate material in mechanical stress models. Therefore, extrapolation of results obtained using silicone substrates cannot be translated directly toward the situation of metallic implant materials...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{protocols}} utilize bone <b>marrow</b> to <b>seed</b> synthetic and decellularized allogeneic bone grafts for {{enhancement of}} scaffold remodeling and fusion. Marrow-derived cytokines induce host neovascularization at the graft surface, but hypoxic conditions cause cell {{death at the}} core. Addition of cellular components that generate an extensive primitive plexus-like vascular network that would perfuse the entire scaffold upon anastomosis could potentially yield significantly higher-quality grafts. We used a mouse model to develop a two-stage protocol for generating vascularized bone grafts using mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from human bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived endothelial cells. The endothelial cells formed tube-like structures and subsequently networks throughout the bone scaffold 4 – 7  days after implantation. hMSCs were essential for stable vasculature both in vitro and in vivo; however, contrary to expectations, vasculature derived from hMSCs briefly cultured in medium designed to maintain a proliferative, nondifferentiated state was more extensive and stable than that with hMSCs with a TGF-β-induced smooth muscle cell phenotype. Anastomosis occurred by day 11, with most hMSCs associating closely with the network. Although initially immature and highly permeable, at 4  weeks the network was mature. Initiation of scaffold mineralization had also occurred by this period. Some human-derived vessels were still present at 5  months, {{but the majority of}} the graft vasculature had been functionally remodeled with host cells.

Early studies of engineered valves showed promise, although lacked complete definition of valve function. Building on prior experiments, we sought to define the in vivo changes in structure and function of autologous engineered pulmonary valved conduits. MethodsMesenchymal stem cells were isolated from neonatal sheep bone <b>marrow</b> and <b>seeded</b> onto a bioresorbable scaffold. After 4 weeks of culture, valved conduits were implanted. Valve function, cusp, and conduit dimensions were evaluated at implantation (echocardiography), at the experimental midpoint (magnetic resonance imaging), and at explant, at 1 day, and 1, 6, 12, or 20 weeks postoperatively (direct measurement, echocardiography). Histologic evaluation was performed. ResultsNineteen animals underwent autologous tissue-engineered valved conduit replacement. At implantation, valved conduit function was excellent; maximum transvalvular pressure gradient by Doppler echocardiography was 17 mm Hg; most valved conduits showed trivial pulmonary regurgitation. At 6 postoperative weeks, valve cusps appeared less mobile; pulmonary regurgitation was mild to moderate. At 12 weeks or more, valved conduit cusps were increasingly attenuated and regurgitant. Valved conduit diameter remained unchanged over 20 weeks. Dimensional measurements by magnetic resonance imaging correlated with direct measurement at explant. ConclusionsWe demonstrate autologous engineered tissue valved conduits that function well at implantation, with subsequent monitoring of dimensions and function in real time by magnetic resonance imaging. In vivo valves undergo structural and functional remodeling without stenosis, but with worsening pulmonary regurgitation after 6 weeks.

To characterise scaffold outputs, we designed a flow cytometry panel that utilises surface marker expression observed in standard 2 D erythroid and megakaryocyte cultures.

Control cultures conducted in parallel but {{in the absence of a}} scaffold were also generally maintained for the longevity of the culture albeit with a higher level of cell death.

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In regions of high bone loading, the mechanoresponsive osteocytes inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by producing signaling molecules. One possible candidate is matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) because acidic serine- and aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif peptides upregulate osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene expression, a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis. These peptides are cleaved from MEPE when relatively more MEPE than PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) is present. We investigated whether mechanical loading of osteocytes affects osteocyte-stimulated osteoclastogenesis by involvement of MEPE. MLO-Y 4 osteocytes were mechanically loaded by 1 -h pulsating fluid flow (PFF; 0. 7 ± 0. 3 Pa, 5 Hz) or kept under static control conditions.

To implement the endochondral approach, suitable scaffolds are required to provide a three-dimensional (3 -D) substrate for cell population and differentiation, and eventually for the generation of osteochondral tissue. Therefore, a novel wet-electrospinning system, using ethanol as the collecting medium, was exploited in this study to fabricate a cotton-like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) /poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffold that consisted of a very loose and uncompressed accumulation of fibers. Rat bone <b>marrow</b> cells were <b>seeded</b> on these scaffolds and chondrogenically differentiated in vitro for 4 weeks followed by subcutaneous implantation in vivo for 8 weeks.

Histological analysis of the in vivo samples revealed extensive new bone formation through the remodeling of the cartilage template. In conclusion, using the wet-electrospinning method, {{we are able to}} create a 3 -D scaffold in which bone tissue can be formed via the endochondral pathway.

40|$|Abstract: Injury {{to growth}} plate {{cartilage}} in children {{can lead to}} bone bridge formation and result in bone growth deformities, a significant clinical problem currently lacking biological treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) offer a promising therapeutic option for regeneration of damaged cartilage, due to their self renewing and multi-lineage differentiation attributes. Although some small animal model studies highlight the therapeutic potential of MSC for growth plate repair, translational research in large animal models, which more closely resemble the human condition, are lacking. Our laboratory has recently characterised MSCs derived from ovine bone marrow, and demonstrated these cells form cartilage-like tissue when transplanted within the gelatin sponge, Gelfoam, in vivo. In the current study, autologous bone <b>marrow</b> MSC were <b>seeded</b> into Gelfoam scaffold containing TGF-� 1, and transplanted into a surgically created defect of the proximal ovine tibial growth plate. Examination of implants at 5 week post-operatively revealed transplanted autologous MSC failed to form new cartilage structure at the defect site, but contributed {{to an increase in}} formation of a dense fibrous tissue. Importantly, the extent of osteogenesis was diminished, and bone bridge formation was not accelerated due to transplantation of MSCs or the gelatin scaffold. The current study represents the first work that has utilised this ovine large animal model to investigate whether autologous bone marrow derived MSC can be used to initiate regeneration at the injured growth plate...|$|R
40|$|CD 34 + {{cells were}} {{purified}} from midtrimester human fetal blood and adult bone <b>marrow</b> samples and <b>seeded</b> in serum-free fibrin-clot cultures {{in order to}} evaluate the number and the responsiveness to recombinant cytokines of pluripotent (CFU-GEMM), erythroid (BFU-E), megakaryocyte (BFU-meg and CFU-meg) and granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) haemopoietic progenitor cells. The number of the different haemopoietic progenitors/ 1 x 10 (3) CD 34 + cells, except CFU-meg, was significantly higher in fetal blood than in adult bone marrow in cultures stimulated by any combination of cytokines including interleukin- 3 (IL- 3), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or stem cell factor (SCF) plus erythropoietin (Epo). Nevertheless, whereas adult BFU-E showed a maximal growth {{in the presence of}} Epo plus IL- 3 or Epo plus SCF, fetal BFU-E showed an optimal growth in the presence of Epo alone, the sensitivity of fetal BFU-E to suboptimal concentrations of Epo being approximately 10 - 15 -fold higher than that of adult BFU-E. Addition of optimal concentrations of IL- 3, GM-CSF or SCF, alone or in various combinations, to Epo-containing cultures induced a significant increase in both the number and size of fetal CFU-GEMM, and CFU-GM, and a parallel decrease of fetal BFU-E. Finally, SCF potently synergized with IL- 3 in increasing the growth of both classes of fetal megakaryocyte progenitors, BFU-meg and CFU-meg...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} information on the Zoroastrian notions of the earth (and accordingly of its divinity) is the Bundahishn, an account of the religion's cosmogony and cosmology completed in about the 12th century. According to that text, the earth was the third of the primordial creations, following that of the sky and the waters, and before that of plants and fire. The creation of the earth is described in three stages: At first, {{the surface of the earth}} was a round, flat disk, floating in the center of the waters that filled the lower half of the [...] "sky". Then, from its surface grew up the mountains, the tallest of these being Hara Berezaiti whose outlying ranges encircled the earth and beyond which lay the world river Aredvi Sura. Finally, during the time of the fourth creation (plants), the primordial tree grew up, and was the prototype of all plants (this tree is already alluded to in scripture as the Saena tree; in Yasht 12.17 it is further described as the [...] "Tree of All Remedies" [...] because it bears the seeds of all healing herbs). The fifth creation is that of the primordial bovine Gavaevodata from whose <b>seed,</b> <b>marrow,</b> organs and soul the earth is populated with animal life and the progenitors of the human race.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of cell culture time on bone formation by rat bone <b>marrow</b> cells <b>seeded</b> in titanium fiber mesh. As a seeding technique, a high cell suspension was used (3 x 10 (6) cells/mL). Therefore, 30 meshes were repeatedly rotated in a 10 mL tube (containing 30 x 10 (6) cells) on a rotation plate (2 rpm) for 3 h. Osteogenic cells were cultured for 1, 4, and 8 days on titanium fiber mesh and finally implanted subcutaneously in rats. Meshes without cells were also implanted subcutaneously in rats. DNA and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses and calcium measurements determined cellular proliferation and differentiation during the in vitro incubation period of the mesh implants. Four weeks after implant insertion, the animals were sacrificed. The implants, with their surrounding tissue, were retrieved and prepared for histologic evaluation and calcium measurements. DNA analysis of the in vitro experiment showed a lag phase from day 1 through day 4, but a 42 % increase in DNA between days 4 and 8. SEM and calcium measurements indicated an increase in calcium from day 1 to day 4, yet only a small but significant increase from days 4 to 8. Histologic analysis demonstrated that bone was formed in all day 1 and day 4 implants, and that the bone-like tissue was present uniformly through the meshes. The bony tissue was morphologically characterized by osteocytes embedded in a mineralized matrix, with a layer of osteoid and osteoblasts at the surface. The day 8 implants showed only calcium phosphate deposition in the titanium fiber mesh. Calcium measurements of the implants revealed that calcification in day 1 implants was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) compared to day 4 and day 8 implants. No significant difference in calcium content existed between day 4 and day 8 implants. On the basis of our results, we conclude that 1) bone formation was generated more effectively in osteogenic cells by a short culture time after seeding in titanium fiber mesh; 2) dynamic cell seeding is probably more effective than static cell seeding; and 3) selection of the right cells from the heterogenous bone marrow population remains a problem...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Vascular-derived cells {{represent}} an established cell source for tissue engineering of cardiovascular constructs. Previously, cell isolation {{was performed by}} harvesting of vascular structures prior to scaffold <b>seeding.</b> <b>Marrow</b> stromal cells (MSC) demonstrate the ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal cell lineages and would offer an alternative cell source for tissue engineering involving a less invasive harvesting technique. We studied the feasibility of using MSC as an alternative cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineering. Methods: Human MSC were isolated from bone marrow and expanded in culture. Subsequently MSC were seeded on bioabsorbable polymers and grown in vitro. Cultivated cells and seeded polymers were studied for cell characterization and tissue formation including extracellular matrix production. Applied methods comprised flow cytometry, histology, immunohistochemistry, transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and biochemical assays. Results: Isolated MSC demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology. Phenotype analysis revealed positive signals for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Histology and SEM of seeded polymers showed layered tissue formation. TEM demonstrated formation of extracellular matrix with deposition of collagen fibrils. Matrix protein analysis showed production of collagen I and III. In comparison to vascular-derived cell constructs quantitative analysis demonstrated comparable amounts of extracellular matrix proteins in the tissue engineered constructs. Conclusions: Isolated MSC demonstrated myofibroblast-like characteristics. Tissue formation on bioabsorbable scaffolds was feasible with extracellular matrix production comparable to vascular-cell derived tissue engineered constructs. It appears that MSC represent a promising cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} whether osteoinductive constructs {{can be generated}} by isolation and expansion of sheep bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) directly within three-dimensional (3 D) ceramic scaffolds, bypassing the typical phase of monolayer (2 D) expansion prior to scaffold loading. Nucleated cells from sheep bone <b>marrow</b> aspirate were <b>seeded</b> into 3 D ceramic scaffolds either by static loading or under perfusion flow and maintained in culture for up to 14 days. The resulting constructs were exposed to enzymatic treatment to assess the number and lineage of extracted cells, or implanted subcutaneously in nude mice to test their capacity to induce bone formation. As a control, BMSC expanded in monolayer for 14 days were also seeded into the scaffolds and implanted. BMSC could be isolated and expanded directly in the 3 D ceramic scaffolds, although they proliferated slower than in 2 D. Upon ectopic implantation, the resulting constructs formed a higher amount of bone tissue than constructs loaded with {{the same number of}} 2 D-expanded cells. Constructs cultivated for 14 days generated significantly more bone tissue than those cultured for 3 days. No differences in bone formation were found between samples seeded by static loading or under perfusion. In conclusion, the culture of bone marrow nucleated cells directly on 3 D ceramic scaffolds represents a promising approach to expand BMSC and streamline the engineering of osteoinductive grafts.

40|$|The use of {{co-culture}} cells {{as well as}} extra cellular matrix {{are among}} those strategies that have been employed to direct mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) bone differentiation in culture. In this regard, there is no study considering the effects of Matrigel on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in vitro bone differentiation. This {{was the subject of}} the present study. Materials and MethodsHuman passaged- 3 MSCs isolated from the <b>marrow</b> aspirates were <b>seeded</b> on either Matrigel or conventional polystyrene plastic surfaces (as control) for 10 days. To compare the cell proliferation in two cultures, the cell numbers were determined during the cultivation period. For bone differentiation, the confluent cultures from either group were provided with osteogenic medium and incubated for 21 days during which the alkaline phosphates (ALP) activity, culture mineralization and the expression of some bone-related genes were quantified and statistically compared. ResultsMTT assay indicated thatMatrigel-cultivated cells underwent statistically less proliferation than polystyrene-cultivated cells (P< 0. 05). Regarding the osteogenic differentiation, ALP activity was significantly high in Matrigel versus plastic cultures. Calcium deposition in Matrigel cultures tended to be significantly extensive compared with that of control cultures (2. 533 ± 0. 017 versus 0. 607 ± 0. 09 mM). Furthermore, according to the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, compared with polystyrene plastic surface, Matrigel seemed to provide a microenvironment in which human MSC expressed osteocalcin and collagen I genes in a significantly higher level. ConclusionCollectively it seems that Matrigel could be considered as an appropriate matrix for MSC osteogenic differentiation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{utilized}} a full-factorial {{design to}} investigate the effect of four factors: presence of whole bone marrow cells, presence of in vitro-generated mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM), presence of dexamethasone, and variations in culture duration, on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on a polymer scaffold. Electrospun poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) fiber mesh scaffolds were seeded with rat MSCs and cultured in complete osteogenic medium for 12 days to generate constructs containing mineralized ECM. MSCs or MSCs and whole bone <b>marrow</b> cells were <b>seeded</b> onto decellularized ECM constructs (PCL/ECM) or plain PCL scaffolds and cultured statically for 4, 8, and 16 days in medium either with or without dexamethasone. After each culture period, the cell number was determined by DNA analysis, and the osteogenic differentiation state of the cells was determined by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium assays. MSCs seeded onto PCL/ECM constructs and cultured in medium either with or without dexamethasone demonstrated similar amounts of calcium deposition after 16 days. A significant increase in cell number over time compared with all other groups was observed when whole bone marrow cells were cocultured with MSCs on PCL scaffolds in medium without dexamethasone. This study establishes that the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs seeded onto ECM-containing constructs is maintained {{even in the absence}} of dexamethasone and that the coculture of MSCs and whole bone marrow cells without dexamethasone and ECM enhances the proliferation of a cell population (or populations) present in the whole bone marrow...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} two biodegradable polymeric systems as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Rat bone <b>marrow</b> cells were <b>seeded</b> and cultured for 1 week on two biodegradable porous polymeric systems, one composed of poly(ethylene glycol) -terephthalate/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEGT/PBT) and the other composed of cornstarch blended with poly(ε-caprolactone) (SPCL). Porous hydroxyapatite granules were used as controls. The ability of cells to proliferate and form extracellular matrix on these scaffolds was assessed by a DNA quantification assay and by scanning electron microscopy examination; their osteogenic differentiation was screened by the expression of alkaline phosphatase. In addition, the in vivo osteogenic potential of the engineered constructs was evaluated through ectopic implantation in a nude mouse model. Results revealed that cells were able to proliferate, differentiate, and form extracellular matrix on all materials tested. Moreover, all constructs induced abundant formation of bone and bone marrow after 4 weeks of implantation. The extent of osteogenesis (~ 30 % of void volume) was similar in all types of implants. However, the amount of bone marrow and the degree of bone contact were higher on HA scaffolds, indicating that the polymers still need to be modulated for higher osteoconductive capacity. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that both PEGT/PBT and SPCL systems are excellent candidates to be used as scaffolds for a cell therapy approach in the treatment of bone defects.
