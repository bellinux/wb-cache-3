5|$|Novelist {{and critic}} Barbara Mujica {{comments}} that the book's English translator, Edith Grossman, fully captures the multiple levels of <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> {{as well as}} García Márquez's modulations in tone. García Márquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their English translations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{case has}} been cited in {{numerous}} law reviews. Some of these were critical of the majority approach, stating that it went beyond the plain <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> {{to open up the}} federal government to liability where none existed. Other reviews merely analyzed the decision and how it affected government-tribe trust cases. Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{conventional}} classroom learning, {{in which}} a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
25|$|Such {{theories}} {{share the}} view {{that there is an}} identifiable original intent or original meaning, contemporaneous with the ratification of a constitution or statute, which should govern its subsequent interpretation. The divisions between the theories relate to what exactly that identifiable original intent or original meaning is: the intentions of the authors or the ratifiers, the original <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> a combination of the two, or the original <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> but not its expected application.|$|E

25|$|Obadiah was an indefatigable writer, chiefly in {{the field}} of Biblical exegesis. The {{characteristic}} features of his exegetical work are respect for the literal <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> and a reluctance to entertain mystical interpretations.|$|E
25|$|According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak {{believed}} in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{letters of}} these words (P, R, D, S) form {{together}} the word PaRDeS ("paradise/orchard"), which became the designation for the Zohar's view of a fourfold <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> of which the mystical sense is considered the highest part.|$|E

50|$|A {{quantitative}} study on <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Testament compared early manuscripts to later manuscripts, {{up to the}} Middle Ages, with the Byzantine manuscripts, and concluded that <b>the</b> <b>text</b> had more than 90% stability over this time period.

50|$|He {{obtained}} {{some knowledge}} of literature and history by reading old German books that he found in <b>the</b> attic <b>of</b> a local manor house; {{although he did not}} know the language at first, he enjoyed looking at the pictures and asked grown-ups about <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> In <b>the</b> process he shaped his own imaginary world of medieval knights and Christian ideals.|$|R
25|$|Some Karaites {{strive to}} adhere {{only to the}} peshat (plain <b>meaning)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> This is in {{contrast}} to Rabbinic Judaism, which relies on the Oral Torah and employs several interpretive methods which, at times, stray from the literal meaning.|$|E
25|$|A variant form {{usually has}} a very similar {{appearance}} and meaning as its base form. The mechanism is intended for variant forms where, generally, if the variant form is unavailable, displaying the base character {{does not change the}} <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> and may not even be noticeable by many readers.|$|E
25|$|As in his {{commentary}} on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic words into the spoken French language of his day, giving latter-day scholars {{a window into the}} vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.|$|E
5000|$|According to Eugene Nida, dynamic {{equivalence}} is <b>the</b> [...] "quality <b>of</b> {{a translation}} in which <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>text</b> {{has been so}} transported into the receptor language that <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receptor is essentially like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original receptors."

40|$|In his "search for <b>the</b> meaning" <b>of</b> mainly 19 th and 20 th century Portuguese texts, Óscar Lopes {{is working}} like a traveller, an adventurer and a detective; {{disregarding}} rigid methodology, yet {{making use of}} his multidisciplinary knowledge, he is interested in what is said and what is suggested, he follows threads or directions in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> and also attempts to make <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} meaning theory, which {{is closely related}} to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or law should be based on what reasonable persons living {{at the time of its}} adoption would have understood the ordinary <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to be. Most originalists, such as Justice Scalia, are associated with that view.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{comparisons}} between surviving {{portions of the}} manuscripts show {{an average of two}} to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.|$|E
25|$|Biblical scholar George W. Young {{dismisses the}} naturalistic explanations, the {{traditional}} and the historical critical perspectives. He contends that these methods of exegesis rely on factual interpretations and fail to capture the full <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> based on its structure. Instead, Young explores the pericope with literary-critical methods as narrative art. Young views the text as fiction, and uses tools and terms often associated with fantastic literature to analyze it.|$|E
50|$|Assuredly it is a {{wise and}} most laudable thing {{to return in}} spirit and affection to <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacred liturgy.

30|$|The GI {{tasks in}} this study conform to these {{criteria}} since learners attend to meaning to notice <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammatical structures in use.

25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} is {{a feature}} of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting {{does not affect the}} <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> itself; it is intended only for human readers.|$|E
25|$|When Phan was five, {{his father}} {{returned}} {{home and he}} began attending his father's classes, where he studied the Chinese classics, such as the Three Character Classic, which took him just three days to memorize. As {{a result of his}} ability to learn quickly, his father decided to move him to further Confucian texts, such as the Analects, which he practiced on banana leaves. In his autobiography, Phan admitted he did not understand the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> in great detail at the time, but by age six, he was skillful enough to write a variant of the Analects that parodied his classmates, which earned him a caning from his father.|$|E
25|$|Compositions more {{commonly}} associated with Indian classical dance and Indian devotional music have also been increasingly used in the Carnatic music repertoire. The performance of the Sanskrit sloka, Tamil viruttam and Telugu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique. Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses, musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm, like an alapana, so both the sound value, and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations. Forms such as the divya prabandham, thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly, however, these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama, javali, padam, thillana and thiruppugazh forms.|$|E
