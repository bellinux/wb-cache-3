40|$|The {{thesis is}} written as a {{consulting}} assignment to Helsinki Memory Technolo-gies Oy. The motivation for this assignment {{was to learn}} more about <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> as a part of Internet of Things ecosystem. Additionally, the thesis seeks if there could be the potentially new business opportunities at the target field. The thesis describes core technologies related to the solid state <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> in the world of Internet of Things (IoT) at Chapter 2 to 4. Standards chapter covers the benefits of the standardization and the most important corresponding IoT forums. That chapter also summarizes IoT development activities of the key companies. At the end of the thesis there is an analysis of the new business opportunities found during the con-sulting period, which are grouped into two subsets: the extensions of existing solutions and the new IoT usage models with memory focus. Conclusion chapter states that the architecture of managed NAND holds a strong position, which is foreseen to remain. This enables the development of IoT support to the <b>mass</b> <b>memories.</b> An additional conclusion is that IoT has reached the critical mass, but its final implementation is not defined yet. The business potential of IoT is estimat...|$|R
40|$|Dimensioning <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> for {{a digital}} library {{is a very}} {{challenging}} problem. That’s for the uncertainty in defining the typological classes of the library “objects” and their amounts. In fact, the size of <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> depends not only on amounts of volumes in each class, {{but also on the}} page sizes, the type of printing and the images represented in each volumes, which affect the efficiency of the various compression methods used in recording digital pages (both lossless and lossy). As a consequence, in dimensioning a digital library every deterministic (analytical) method is useless, at least in the majority of cases. It seems more appropriate using statistical and probability calculus methods, such as Monte Carlo methods. These methods allow to simulate the amount of memory needed by each volume in library, as a limit. Of course, statistics allow to simulate only “few” volumes, extending results to all the volumes in library. Above all, simulation can allow very interesting “what-if” analyses, varying the hypotheses about library structure and policies about its management and costs. Last but non least, evaluation of needed <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> amounts must be completed by the design of the memories hierarchy and analysis of mean life expectation of physical supports, together with their technological obsolescence. All items strictly correlated to system efficiency for online digital libraries. An example of digital library dimensioning is presented using an “ad hoc” software (DBD. EXE), used by the author during the CILEA course “Design of a Digital Library”...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Arithmetic {{error codes}} {{constitute}} {{a class of}} error codes that are preserved during most arithmetic operations. Effectiveness studies for arithmetic error codes have shown their value for concurrent detection of faults in arithmetic processors, data transmission subsystems, and main storage units in fault-tolerant computers In this paper, it is shown that the same class of codes is also quite effective for detecting storage errors in both shift-register and magnetic-recording <b>mass</b> <b>memories.</b> Some of the results are more general and deal with properties of arithmetic error codes in detecting unidirectional failures. For example, it is shown that a low-cost arithmetic error code with check modulus A = 2 - 1 can detect any unidirectional failure which affects fewer than N bits. The use of arithmetic error codes for checking of <b>mass</b> <b>memories</b> is further justified since it {{eliminates the need for}} hard-core or self-checking code translators and reduces the number of different types of cod...|$|R

Read-write-erase in situ operation is possible but is presently impractical because of limitations in available recording media.

This platform was designed for a total mass of about 120 kg mass at launch. Its attitude in space is maintained by using a star sensor, solar sensors, a magnetometer, gyrometers, several magnetic rods and reaction wheels. If an orbit control and orbit manoeuvres are needed, a hydrazine system may be used. The on-board management is centralised, and uses a 10 MIPS microprocessor T805. A <b>mass</b> <b>memory</b> is available for the data storage. The telemetry and telecommand used the CCSDS standard.|$|E

The VIS used a 499×768 pixel CCD detector operating at 0.5 to 0.8 μm.

50|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Constantino sees {{the history of}} the Filipino as {{primarily}} {{the history of the}}ir struggles against colonial oppression.” He centers his historical narrative on the idea of the development of a “national consciousness” among Filipino people whose consciousness has been molded through centuries of colonial control through the instruments of religion, education and other cultural institutions. Constantino argues that the “beginnings of a counter-consciousness nevertheless began to emerge”, and the “revolutionary instinct of the people manifested itself in a series of actions which….were in reality assertions and dialectal progressions of the consciousness that was emerging”. He believes that “this counter-consciousness manifested itself in various forms of resistance only to recede at each instance into the matrix of colonial consciousness because of unripe conditions and other factors, but which nevertheless became part of <b>mass</b> <b>memory</b> and therefore part of the Filipino tradition of struggle”. For Constantino, this struggle also takes on the dimension of a class struggle and class conflict, between the “masses” and the “elites”, the “have-nots” and the “haves”, with the former’s anti-colonial aspiration for independence repeatedly betrayed by elite’s collaboration with the colonizers.|$|E

[...] "It’s the Lebanese notion of <b>mass</b> <b>memory,</b> and people's very subjective memory and view of the world," [...] he explains. [...] "This subsequently dictates how society functions. I extrapolated that into sci-fi theory.". [...] Naim had sent his script to the French project Equinox, where hundreds of screenwriters {{from around the world}} submit their movie scripts. Only ten are chosen and are flown into Bordeaux to work on their screenplay with a group of experts for a week. Naim was one of the lucky ten and was then fixed with an agent. Upon his arrival, Naim {{made it clear that he}} was not interested in having anyone but himself direct his movie. Naim indeed was allotted the post of director and, once headed to the US, Lionsgate Entertainment gave the script a green light. [...] As Lionsgate was recruiting actors, Robin Williams expressed interest in playing the lead role of Alan Hakman. Having loved the script, Williams told Naim that [...] "what really struck him was the sense of mortality, something he hadn't explored as an actor before" [...] ". Within weeks, the rest of the cast and crew was hired. The 95 minutes movie was shot on 35mm film in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and was described by Naim as a very harmonious, very organized 35-day shoot [...] "with no problems what-so-ever".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hollywood film {{adaptations of}} real life {{disasters}} suggest the creation of fictional <b>mass</b> <b>memories.</b> A study of movie posters, including Alive, United 93, and World Trade Center, illustrates that specific techniques are used to adapt real life events to the screen. These will be highlighted with various examples. Among others, patriotism is used to attract viewers to films and to suggest certain reactions to specific happenings. Also, actual evidence is used selectively, and only when it fits with Classical Hollywood Narrative structure. As such, Hollywood not only markets such films by established generic codes and conventions but also positions them to function as propaganda to unite mass audiences by creating <b>mass</b> knowledge and <b>memories</b> that are fictionalized to some extent. As such, these film adaptations represent PR as previously discussed by Noam Chomsky. These texts hold the power to create a unity that diverts from an actual issue, such as {{the issue of a}} policy. Such a film investigation enables students to further develop an understanding of history, the business of media, media consumption in general, and personal reactions to such adaptations. Many opportunities arise as the subject matter permits multidisciplinary approaches that reinforce critical thinking skills required for successful studies...|$|R
