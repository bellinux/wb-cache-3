40|$|A {{parachute}} joint {{is defined}} as a location where a component is sewn or connected to another component. During the design and developmental phase of a parachute system, the joints for each structural component are isolated and tested through a process called seam and joint testing. The objective of seam and joint testing is to determine the degradation on a single component due to interaction with other components; this data is then used when calculating the margin of safety for that component. During the engineering developmental phase of CPAS (Capsule Parachute Assembly System), the parachute system for the NASA Orion Crew Module, testing was completed for every joint of the six subsystems: the four parachutes (<b>main,</b> <b>drogue,</b> pilot, and FBCP [forward bay cover parachute]), the retention release bridle, and the retention panels. The number of joint tests for these subsystems totaled 92, which provides a plethora of data and results for further analysis. In this paper, the data and results of these seam and joint tests are examined to determine the effects, if any, of different operators and sewing machines on the strength of parachute joints. Other variables are also studied to determine their effect on joint strength, such as joint complexity, joint strength magnitude, material type, and material construction. Findings reveal that an optimally-run seam and joint test program could result in an increased understanding {{of the structure of the}} parachute; this should lead to a parachute built with optimal components, potentially saving system weight and volume...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new {{calculation of the}} opening shock factor C (sub k) characterizing the inflation performance of NASA's Orion spacecraft <b>main</b> and <b>drogue</b> parachutes opening under a reefing constraint (1 st stage reefing), as currently tested in the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) program. This calculation {{is based on an}} application of the Momentum-Impulse Theorem at low mass ratio (R (sub m) is less than 10 (sup - 1)) and on an earlier analysis of the opening performance of drogues decelerating point masses and inflating along horizontal trajectories. Herein we extend the reach of the Theorem to include the effects of payload drag and gravitational impulse during near-vertical motion - both important pre-requisites for CPAS parachute analysis. The result is a family of C (sub k) versus R (sub m) curves which can be used for extrapolating beyond the drop-tested envelope. The paper proves this claim {{in the case of the}} CPAS <b>Mains</b> and <b>Drogues</b> opening while trailing either a Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle or a Parachute Test Vehicle (an Orion capsule boiler plate). It is seen that in all cases the values of the opening shock factor can be extrapolated over a range in mass ratio that is at least twice that of the test drop data...|$|R
40|$|The European Space Agency’s Huygens probe {{separated}} from the NASA Cassini spacecraft on 25 December 2004, after having been attached for a 7 -year interplanetary journey and three orbits around Saturn. The probe reached the predefined NASA/ESA interface point on 14 January 2005 at 09 : 05 : 52. 523 (UTC) and performed a successful entry and descent sequence. The probe softly impacted on Titan’s surface {{on the same day}} at 11 : 38 : 10. 77 (UTC) with a speed of about 4. 54 m/s. The probe entry and descent trajectory was reconstructed from the estimated initial state vector provided by the Cassini Navigation team, the probe housekeeping data, and measurements from the scientific payload. This paper presents the methodology and discuss the results of the reconstruction effort. Furthermore the probe roll rate was reconstructed prior to the main entry phase deceleration pulse and throughout the entire descent phase under the <b>main</b> and <b>drogue</b> parachute...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance characteristics}} have been determined for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster <b>drogue,</b> <b>main,</b> and pilot parachutes. The performance evaluation on the 20 -degree conical ribbon parachutes is {{based primarily on}} air drop tests of full scale prototype parachutes. In addition, parametric wind tunnel tests were performed and used in parachute configuration development and preliminary performance assessments. The wind tunnel test data are compared to the drop test results and both sets of data are {{used to determine the}} predicted performance of the Solid Rocket Booster flight parachutes. Data from other drop tests of large ribbon parachutes are also compared with the Solid Rocket Booster parachute performance characteristics. Parameters assessed include full open terminal drag coefficients, reefed drag area, opening characteristics, clustering effects, and forebody interference...|$|R
40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the main parachutes, the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on deceleration by drogue parachutes. These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the main parachutes, which have a ringsail construction. The drogue parachutes {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the main parachutes, with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP). Like the <b>main</b> parachutes, the <b>drogue</b> parachutes will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open drogue parachutes. Orion spacecraft drogue parachutes will have three stages, with FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than disreefing from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion drogue parachutes includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the approaches and methods selected in fabrication of a carbon composite demonstration {{structure for the}} Composite Crew Module (CCM) Program. The program is managed by the NASA Safety and Engineering Center with participants from ten NASA Centers and AFRL. Multiple aerospace contractors are participating in the design development, tooling and fabrication effort as well. The goal {{of the program is}} to develop an agency wide design team for composite habitable spacecraft. The specific goals for this development project are: a). To gain hands on experience in design, building and testing a composite crew module. b) To validate key assumptions by resolving composite spacecraft design details through fabrication and testing of hardware. This abstract is based on Preliminary Design data [...] The final design will continue to evolve through the fall of 2007 with fabrication mostly completed by conference date. From a structures perspective, the. CCM {{can be viewed as a}} pressure module with variable pressure time histories and a series of both impact and quasi-static, high intensity point, line, and area distributed loads. The portion of the overall space vehicle being designed and. fabricated by the CCM team is just the pressure module and primary loading points. The heaviest point loads are applied and distributed to the pressure module at. an aluminum Service Module/Alternate Launch Abort System (SM/ALAS) fittings and at <b>Main</b> and <b>Drogue</b> Chute fittings. Significant line loads with metal to metal impact is applied at. the Lids ring. These major external point and line loads as well as pressure impact loads (blast and water landing) are applied to the lobed floor though the reentry shield and crushable materials. The pressure module is divided into upper and lower. shells that mate together with a bonded belly band splice joint to create the completed structural assembly. The benefits of a split CCM far outweigh the risks of a joint. These benefits include lower tooling cost and less manufacturing risk. Assembly of the top and bottom halves of the pressure shell will allow access to the interior of the shell throughout remaining fabrication sequence and can also potentially permit extensive installation of equipment and. crew facilities prior to final assembly of the two shell halves. A Pi pre-form is a woven carbon composite material which is provided in pre-impregnated form and frozen for long term storage. The cross-section shape allows the top of the pi to be bonded to a flat or curved surface with a second flat plate composite section bonded between two upstanding legs of the Pi. One of the regions relying on the merits of the Pi pre-form is the backbone. All connections among plates of the backbone structure, including the upper flanges, and to the lobe base of the pressure shell are currently joined by Pi pre-forms. The intersection of backbone composite plates is formed by application of two Pi pre-forms, top flanges and lobed surfaces are bonded with one Pi pre-form. The process of applying the pre-impregnated pi-preform will be demonstrated to include important steps like surface preparation, forming, application of pressure dams, vacuum bagging for consolidation, and curing techniques. Chopped carbon fiber tooling was selected over other traditional metallic and carbon fiber tooling. The requirement of schedule and cost economy for a moderate reuse cure tool warranted composite tooling options. Composite tooling schedule duration of 18 weeks compared favorably against other metallic tooling including invar tooling. Composite tooling also shows significant cost savings over low CTE metallic options. The composite tooling options were divided into two groups and the final decision was based on the cost, schedule, tolerance, temperature, and reuse requirements...|$|R
