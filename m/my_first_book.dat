2500|$|Binchy's first {{published}} {{book is a}} compilation of her newspaper articles titled <b>My</b> <b>First</b> <b>Book.</b> Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy's bio posted at Read Ireland describes: [...] "The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist's interest in character. The rest {{of the book is}} mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, 'I Was a Winter Sport.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I publish these poems, few {{though they}} are, {{because it is}} not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. [...] I can no longer expect to be {{revisited}} by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>book,</b> nor indeed could I well sustain it if [...] it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. [...] About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same question and I even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>book,</b> make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 1883, {{with enough}} money to last about four months Caine, {{accompanied}} by Mary, went to the Isle of Wight where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near Sandown. [...] There he set to work writing his first novel The Shadow of a Crime. Inspired by his Cumbrian heritage the plot was based {{on one of the}} oldest legends of the Lake District, told to him by his grandfather, Ralph Hall. In it he uses the Cumbrian dialect that he had listened to and spoke during his childhood. When he had finished he moved back to London. Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in Lincoln’s Inn, he re-wrote it. After running as a serial in the Liverpool Mercury, Caine’s novel was published in February 1885, by Chatto & Windus, and serialised in several newspapers. [...] He was later invited to write the story of writing The Shadow of a Crime, which after its appearance in the Idler was published in 1894 in <b>My</b> <b>First</b> <b>Book.</b> [...] After the publication of Caine's first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted by Contemporary Authors, Terpening said: “My desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as I suspect {{it does for}} most writers, from a love of reading. From early grade school years, when I was given <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>books</b> (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in Gresham, Oregon (where I {{spent most of my}} free time), to the present, when I teach Italian literature for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book—both as an artifact and as a source of delight, a distraction from the constraints of life. A good book carries you away and never lets you down.” ...|$|R
60|$|I saw a {{good deal}} of Wilde at that time--was it 1887 or 1888?--I have no way of fixing the date except that I had {{published}} <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>book</b> 'The Wanderings of Usheen' and that Wilde had not yet published his 'Decay of Lying.' He had, before our first meeting, reviewed my book and despite its vagueness of intention, and the inexactness of its speech, praised without qualification; and what was worth more than any review had talked about it, and now he asked me to eat my Xmas dinner with him, believing, I imagine, that I was alone in London.|$|E
60|$|This book is {{more than}} a mere reprint of Birds in a Village first {{published}} in 1893. That was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>book</b> about bird life, with some impressions of rural scenes, in England; and, {{as is often the case}} with a first book, its author has continued to cherish a certain affection for it. On this account it pleased me when its turn came to be reissued, since this gave me the opportunity of mending some faults in the portions retained and of throwing out a good deal of matter which appeared to me not worth keeping.|$|E

Hopelessly crippled, my mother now mourned the loss of her [...] "baby" [...] and the soldier's keen eyes grew dim, for he loved this little daughter above anything else in the world. The flag of his sunset march was drooping on its staff. Nothing but poverty and a lonely old age seemed before him, and yet, in his letters to me, he gave out only the briefest hints of his despair.|$|E

6000|$|It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>book,</b> and so, perhaps, {{the reader}} will excuse me for being a good deal uplifted by the noise it made. Then too, it is only fair to call {{attention}} to the fact that aside from Edward Eggleston's Hoosier Schoolmaster, Howe's Story of a Country Town, and Zury, by Joseph Kirkland, I had the middle west almost entirely to myself. Not one of the group of western writers who have since won far greater fame, and twenty times more dollars than I, had at that time published a single volume. William Allen White, Albert Bigelow Payne, Stewart Edward White, Jack London, Emerson Hough, George Ade, Meredith Nicholson, Booth Tarkington, and Rex Beach were all to come.

40|$|My grandfather, whom I call Nono, {{never saw}} a matzoh ball until he came to America. Born in Salonika, Greece, rather than in an Eastern European shtetl, he spoke Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), not Yiddish. He was, in short, not “Jewish ” as {{typically}} conceptualized in the United States—and even the most recent works on Jews in America, such as those by Sarna (2004) and Diner (2004), fail to give these Ladino-speaking Jews due attention. Likewise, where I grew up, Nono’s world had been as foreign to me as in these two books except for the glimpses of the language, culture, and customs I caught during my trips to Florida, to visit Nono and his siblings. My fascination with their distinctive identity has inspired me to collect books about the experience of Sephardic Jews {{in an attempt to}} recreate in my imagination the world in which my ancestors lived. I discovered <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>books</b> on this topic on a warm winter evening in Florida several years ago while exploring a dusty closet in my great uncle’s home. In a box in the corner, I stumbled upon several books that would become the core of my collection.
