40|$|Automatic speech {{recognition}} (ASR) {{is essential for}} a robot to communicate with people. One of the main problems with ASR for robots is that robots inevitably generate <b>motor</b> <b>noises.</b> The noise is captured with strong power by the robot’s microphones, because the noise sources are closer to the microphones than the target speech source. The signal-to-noise ratio of input speech becomes quite low (less than 0 dB). However, {{it is possible to}} estimate the noise by using information on the robot’s own motions and postures, because a type of motion/gesture produces almost the same pattern of noise every time it is performed. This paper proposes a method to improve ASR under <b>motor</b> <b>noises</b> by using the information on the robot’s motion/gesture. The method selectively uses three techniques – multi-condition training, maximumlikelihood linear regression (MLLR), and missing feature theory (MFT). The former two techniques cope with the <b>motor</b> <b>noises</b> by selecting the noise-type-dependent acoustic model corresponding to a performing motion/gesture. The last technique extracts unreliable acoustic features in an input sound by matching the input with a pre-recorded noise of the current motion/gesture, and masks them in {{speech recognition}} to improve ASR performance. Because, in our method, ASR technique selection affects the systems performance, we evaluated the performance of three ASRs for each noise type of a robot’s motion/gesture to obtain the best technique selection rule. The preliminary results of isolated word recognition showed the effectiveness of our method using the obtained technique selection rule. 1...|$|R

An alternative approach is to ignore the kinematic term and read odometry data from robot wheels after each command—such data may then be treated {{as one of the}} sensors rather than as kinematics.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical noise: Hi-MD {{units are}} {{mechanical}} devices, and as such, emit a noise intermittently. A disc is read (or written to) in bursts. This {{means that when}} recording (for example), the audio data {{is fed to a}} memory buffer first, then written to disc as that memory buffer is filled. The audible manifestation of this is that a spinning <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> is heard for a short period, followed by a far longer period of silence. Then some spinning whir again, then silence. The cycle is repeated. The same applies to playback, only differently: a disc is spun faster than required for normal playback (to fill the memory buffer), then stops spinning and the audio information is emptied (played back) from memory normally. As the memory buffer depletes, the disc spins up again, maintaining the fill of the memory buffer, only to spin down the disc again (into silence). The buffer memory allows the disc to spin down completely most of the time, conserving battery life. However, during live recording operations with a microphone, this can be a problem. If the microphone is directly connected to the unit (i.e. directly connected to the MIC jack without a wire), or simply close enough with a fairly quiet background, this intermittent <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> can be audibly present in the recording—if some basic precautions are not taken. This contrasts with flash-based recorders with no moving parts for recording, which are able to record in silence with no self-noise.|$|E

50|$|If the {{building}} has large motors, driving such things as fans, pumps, elevators, etc., these should also be on the multipoint grid. However, {{they should not be}} on segments of the grid that will service equipment such as audio amplifiers, small signal radio circuits, computer networks, sensitive electrical instrumentation, etc. Since building two grids into the same building may be prohibitively expensive, a good compromise is to connect the low frequency, high current equipment to the grid at or near the ground rods and entrance transformers, {{in such a way that}} their load will not flow across the segment of the grid connected to the low current equipment. Thus the system is still an electrically continuous unit, but <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> does not impinge directly into signal paths.|$|E
50|$|The PowerSwim is {{a device}} {{somewhat}} like {{two pairs of}} long thin airplane wings, one pair {{at each end of}} an axis. The axis is fastened to a scuba diver's shins by straps round his legs. The longer pair of wings (about 6 ft wide or a bit less) is at his hips and the shorter pair is at his ankles. The wings rotate limitedly on axles near their front edges, and thus on upstroke and downstroke they propel water backwards. It is claimed that the length of the front wing lets it operate outside the cone of wake that starts at the diver's shoulders. It is claimed to let a scuba diver or swim much faster (250%) than with swimfins for the same amount of bodily effort, if used correctly, and being not motorized, it makes no <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> to be heard by hostile hydrophones, but noise would occur if the front wings are allowed to hit the diver's hips at end of upstroke. It works somewhat like a penguin's or turtle's side-mounted front flippers. Its estimated cost is less than $500. The diver uses it by moving his legs up and down together, letting the knees bend and straighten.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a circuit}} {{known as a}} chopper, the average voltage applied to the motor is varied by {{switching}} the supply voltage very rapidly. As the [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] ratio is varied to alter the average applied voltage, {{the speed of the}} motor varies. The percentage [...] "on" [...] time multiplied by the supply voltage gives the average voltage applied to the motor. Therefore, with a 100 V supply and a 25% [...] "on" [...] time, the average voltage at the motor will be 25 V. During the [...] "off" [...] time, the armature's inductance causes the current to continue through a diode called a [...] "flyback diode", in parallel with the motor. At this point in the cycle, the supply current will be zero, and therefore the average motor current will always be higher than the supply current unless the percentage [...] "on" [...] time is 100%. At 100% [...] "on" [...] time, the supply and motor current are equal. The rapid switching wastes less energy than series resistors. This method is also called pulse-width modulation (PWM) and is often controlled by a microprocessor. An output filter is sometimes installed to smooth the average voltage applied to the motor and reduce <b>motor</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

40|$|Antagonistic muscular co-activation can {{compensate}} for movement variability induced by <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> {{at the expense}} of increased energetic costs. Greater antagonistic co-activation is commonly observed in older adults, which could be an adaptation to increased <b>motor</b> <b>noise.</b> The present study tested this hypothesis by manipulating <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> in twelve young subjects while they practiced a goal-directed task using a myoelectric virtual arm, which was controlled by their biceps and triceps muscle activity. <b>Motor</b> <b>noise</b> was increased by increasing the coefficient of variation of the myoelectric signals. As hypothesized, subjects adapted by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this was associated with reduced noise-induced performance decrements. A second hypothesis was that a virtual decrease in <b>motor</b> <b>noise,</b> achieved by smoothing the myoelectric signals, would have the opposite effect: co-activation would decrease and motor performance would improve. However, the results showed that a decrease in noise made performance worse instead of better, with no change in co-activation. Overall, these findings suggest that the nervous system adapts to virtual increases in <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this preserves motor performance. Reducing noise may have failed to benefit performance due to characteristics of the filtering process itself, e. g. delays are introduced and muscle activity bursts are attenuated. The observed adaptations to increased noise may explain in part why older adults and many patient populations have greater antagonistic co-activation, which could represent an adaptation to increased <b>motor</b> <b>noise,</b> along with a desire for increased joint stability...|$|E
