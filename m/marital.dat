5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during <b>marital</b> sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during <b>marital</b> sex implies infidelity. Others believe that <b>marital</b> condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|His wife having died by October 1441, {{within two}} years he married Katherine Strangways, née Neville, who was dowager duchess of Norfolk and noble in her own right, being sister of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and thus {{what would have been}} {{considered}} a great <b>marital</b> prize. She brought him further territorial and financial augmentation.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court {{decision}} Griswold v.

5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their <b>marital</b> families. Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|After the British were defeated, more French Creole {{families}} evaded Anglo-American rule {{by moving}} to the Spanish-controlled land on the west bank, including wealthy merchants Charles Gratiot, Sr. and Gabriel Cerre. Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had <b>marital</b> ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of artificial contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and <b>marital</b> relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her <b>marital</b> relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage.

Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} and <b>marital</b> practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, {{in sharp contrast to}} Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women were not required to be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E
5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. The church opposed it, {{but it had}} huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that <b>marital</b> separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully exerted pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion and pornography.|$|E
5|$|Family {{tradition}} {{holds that}} Johnson broke off an early <b>marital</b> engagement {{when he was}} about sixteen years old because of his mother's disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother's interference. Despite the fact that the engagement was broken off, a daughter named Celia was born. She was raised by the Johnson family and later married to Wesley Fancher, {{one of the men who}} served in Johnson's regiment at the Battle of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|For the husband, {{the sale}} {{released}} {{him from his}} <b>marital</b> duties, including any financial responsibility for his wife.

5|$|Goldschmidt {{declined}} {{to run for}} re-election in 1990, despite the widely held perception {{that he could have}} been easily re-elected; at the time, he cited <b>marital</b> difficulties.

5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} <b>marital</b> {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation.

5|$|In 1843 Hogg {{became the}} target of a {{blackmail}} attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane's <b>marital</b> status. Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her <b>marital</b> status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few <b>marital</b> alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and <b>marital</b> property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E

Jambulingam and M. S. Money. Ghantasala composed the film's music.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his <b>marital</b> infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E

5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's <b>marital</b> problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed {{in the studio with}} Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E
5|$|The case {{came before}} Mr. Justice Owen and a jury at Leicester Crown Court in July 1990.

5|$|The date of Paston’s letter {{suggests}} {{the marriage was}} still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win his brother George’s final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of Warwick’s land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England. Richard retained Neville’s forfeit estates {{he had already been}} granted in the summer of 1471: Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his <b>marital</b> household.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} {{was used}} as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, <b>marital</b> problems and other social issues.|$|E
5|$|The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's <b>marital</b> {{arrangements}} with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and Donald Rayfield has offered evidence, {{based on the}} couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim. The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a <b>marital</b> breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no {{time for him to}} be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little time to deal with household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E
