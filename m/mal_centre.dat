50|$|Jackson also {{appeared}} in a televised Australian celebrity boxing match in 2002 in which he went up against retired Australian rugby league <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga. Jackson was soundly defeated. Jackson had previously beaten Essendon toughman Ron Andrews in a points decision on 10 December 1984 in a six-round boxing match at the Perth Entertainment Centre.|$|R
50|$|Souths Magpies <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga, {{making the}} first of a record 4 Kangaroo Tours as a player, was the leading point scorer on the tour with 166 from 10 tries and 68 goals {{including}} 48 points in the three Tests against Great Britain (2 tries, 21 goals). Manly-Warringah winger John Ribot was the leading try scorer on the tour with 25.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, he {{teamed up}} with <b>Mal</b> Meninga as <b>centre</b> to score a premiership win for the Canberra Raiders. He was then {{involved}} in controversy when both the Canberra Raiders and new Auckland Warriors tried to register him for the 1995 season. After a long dispute Wiki stayed with Canberra. Wiki was selected for the New Zealand team {{to compete in the}} end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played at centre in the Kiwis' 22-20 loss.|$|R
50|$|Giant Queensland <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga, after {{not being}} used off the bench in the first test, made his {{official}} test debut in this game in place of Steve Rogers {{who moved to the}} bench. Meninga had an unhappy game though, dislocating his elbow in the 28th minute after a crunching blindside tackle from Kiwi winger Dane O'Hara, {{while at the same time}} attempting to break a tackle from Kiwi fullback Gary Kemble. The other major change for the Australians was Ray Price coming into the side at lock for the injured Paul Vautin.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the third}} and final game of the 1991 State of Origin series, O'Connor was hit in a high tackle from Queensland <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga in the sixth minute, leaving him with a broken nose and two black eyes. [...] Despite the riot act being read to both teams after a fiery Game 2, the NSWRL failed to cite Meninga for the {{incident}} and O'Connor was forced to accept an apology from him (at the time Meninga was the reigning Australian captain and there was the Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand starting a month later).|$|R
50|$|The 1989 NSWRL {{season was}} the 8th {{in the history}} of Australian club the Canberra Raiders. Coached by Tim Sheens and captained by Australian {{international}} <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga, the Raiders finished the minor rounds in 4th spot. They then won through to their second ever Grand Final (after playing in the 1987 game) where they made history by not only being the first team to win the premiership from 4th spot or lower after defeating Balmain in the Grand Final, but also by becoming the first non-Sydney team to win the premiership in its history dating back to 1908.|$|R
5000|$|In February, Watene-Zelezniak was {{a member}} of the Panthers' Auckland Nines squad. He made his NRL debut for the Panthers against the South Sydney Rabbitohs on 7 April. His {{selection}} came after Matt Moylan, Waqa Blake, and Peta Hiku were dropped for disciplinary reasons. He played on the wing outside his younger brother Dallin, who said. [...] "I had a feeling at the start of the week he was going to make his debut because they asked me to play left <b>centre.</b> <b>Mal</b> was training well, so I went over to him and said, 'I think you’re playing this week'." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, Peter Jackson played rugby {{union in}} the under-17s Australian schoolboys {{representative}} side before {{playing in the}} under-18s Australian schoolboys rugby league side the following year. [...] He went on {{to play in the}} Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Souths Brisbane and prove himself as an attacking player at [...] and [...] under the coaching of Wayne Bennett. At Souths, Jackson was team mate to heavyweight <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga and fullback Gary Belcher. In 1986, Jackson made his State of Origin début for Queensland, and the following year he followed Wayne Bennett to play for the Raiders in the NSWRL premiership, where again he linked with Meninga and Belcher who had moved there at the end of 1985.|$|R
50|$|The Game III decider back in Brisbane was fast-paced and desperately {{fought with}} {{never more than}} four points {{separating}} the sides. Queensland led 8-4 at half-time but two New South Wales tries, both unconverted by O'Connor who also missed a long-range penalty goal from near half-way, took the Blues to a 12-8 lead. Strangely coach Sheens had stuck with Game 2 hero O'Connor as goal kicker despite him not being the regular kicker for Manly and the presence {{in the side of}} regular club kickers Greg Alexander (Penrith) and Rod Wishart (Illawarra). Late in the second-half a superb dash by Maroons' hooker Steve Walters paved the way for a try to replacement back Dale Shearer, levelling the match. Repeating O'Connor's deed in Sydney, Maroon <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga landed the sideline conversion (the only goal kicked in the game), lifting Queensland to a 14-12 victory.|$|R
25|$|While the Queensland rugby league team's players mostly {{come from}} Queensland, up until 1980 when {{residential}} selection criteria were still used, some of New South Wales' most prominent footballers, such as Dally Messenger and Clive Churchill, also {{played for the}} Maroons. Queensland's players {{are some of the}} most famous athletes Australia produces, with goal-kicking <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga being named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1990, the first rugby league player to ever do so. Since the turn of the century Maroons players have become big name footballers not only in rugby league but in other codes as well. Rugby union's 2003 World Cup Final alone featured four former Queensland players: Brad Thorn playing for the All Blacks, and Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri and Wendell Sailor playing for the Wallabies. Former Maroons Karmichael Hunt and Israel Folau were both recruited by the AFL to play Australian rules football (and both also currently play professional rugby union).|$|R
50|$|Their opponents {{were to be}} the Canberra Raiders who, after 5 {{years of}} competition, had reached their first Grand Final. The Raiders were co-coached by Kangaroos coach Don Furner and Queensland coach Wayne Bennett who had jointly won the Dally M Coach of the Year award for their efforts in lifting the Raiders from easy beats to premiership contenders. The team {{included}} players such as captain Dean Lance, Queensland and Kangaroo Tour fullback Gary Belcher, <b>centres</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga (himself a test veteran who had returned after breaking his arm against Manly earlier in the year) and Peter Jackson, hooker Steve Walters and front rowers Sam Backo and New Zealand test player (and former NZ Water Polo international) Brent Todd with a young Kevin Walters also on the bench. Also sitting on the Raiders bench for the game as emergencies were young Glenn Lazarus and Laurie Daley, though neither would {{be used in the}} Grand Final.|$|R

25|$|Former club {{player and}} Welsh {{international}} Kel Coslett {{took over as}} coach in June 1980. However, his spell as coach {{was not nearly as}} successful as his spell as a player, and St Helens won nothing whilst under Coslett's command, finishing mid-table in both seasons. He held the post for two years before handing over to Billy Benyon. Not in-keeping with several of his predecessors, Benyon did not enjoy any success in his first season as St Helens coach, losing the Lancashire Cup final of that year to Warrington. Nothing was won in the 1983–84 season, but Saints won back the Lancashire Cup, with a 26–18 win at Wigan in the 1984–85 season. They also won the Premiership in the same season with a 36–16 victory over defending champions Hull Kingston Rovers at Elland Road in Leeds. The 1984–85 season saw the arrival (for one season only) of giant Australian international <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga who quickly became a crowd favourite at Knowsley Road. In Benyon's last season as coach, 1985–86, nothing was won.|$|R
50|$|New South Wales, captained for {{the first}} time by Manly-Warringah hooker Max Krilich who got the job ahead of Parramatta lock Ray Price, won their first Origin match in game I of the 1982 series at Lang Park 20-16, {{inspired}} by a fine display from halfback Steve Mortimer but not before resisting another valiant comeback by Queensland. The Blues led 17-6 and appeared to be coasting toward a comfortable victory until <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga - who achieved the rare feat of winning the man-of-the-match award from a losing side - cut a swathe through the New South Wales defence. His destructive bursts led to tries for winger John Ribot and centre Mitch Brennan which cut the Blues’ lead to one point. Mortimer laid on a late try for Penrith's powerful young replacement back Brad Izzard to lift the Blues to a 20-16 lead and the Maroons were then required to battle desperately to hold their line intact for the final minutes. Fullback Greg Brentnall kept the scores tight when he leapt spectacularly to claim a Queensland bomb a minute from full-time.|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} larger, detached, energy {{intensive}} dwellings in poorly serviced, low-density, urban fringe locations, leaves governments, households and communities {{vulnerable to the}} impacts of climate change. The planning and design of new outer urban areas, and the retrofitting of existing ones, affects {{the extent to which}} communities can adapt to changing climactic conditions. The think tank focused on the south-east peri-urban and coastal growth region of Melbourne, which contains a large amount of low density greenfield development. This area is potentially highly vulnerable to temperature increases, rainfall decreases, increased bushfire risk and sea level rises as a result of climate change. Given the multiple and competing objectives of the stakeholders involved in housing provision, the challenge to build communities’ capacity to adapt to change is more complex than attempting to change the attitudes, behaviour, barriers and choices of individuals. What is needed is better understanding of the dynamic and integrated processes involved in shaping expectations and aspirations for housing across a range of stakeholders. Research need There is a need for research to strengthen theories and models that address gaps in urban design and policy between factors such as supply-demand or technology-behaviour relationships and ways to assess the role that multiple actors play in shaping housing expectations and aspirations. There is also a need to build stronger links between that type of research and the policy development process. Policy needs 1. Government housing and planning policy needs to reconsider the relationship between supply and demand in the housing sector. The persistent belief that ‘builders provide what the market demands’ was expressed but heavily disputed amongst participants. Building standards, housing and urban design should anticipate future changes in climate and the need for current and future homes to be increasingly efficient in water and energy efficiency. This should include incentives and regulation for rental properties. 2. Adapting to a variable and changing climate presents significant problems for current models of planning and housing delivery in growth areas. These can be addressed through stronger regulation of the urban growth boundary, incentives to increase housing densities (while maintaining open space and urban ‘green infrastructure’) and to offer a variety of housing types, and provision of important infrastructure and services such as public transport in outer areas. These recommendations are particularly pertinent for the State Government as they {{are in the process of}} preparing the next metropolitan strategy for Melbourne. 3. House pricing policy and claims of improved ‘affordability’ need to reflect the long-term running costs of housing as well as cost of land development and construction. Government policy should encourage home buyers and those who finance, build and market homes to factor in the long term costs of climate change in their decision making. Simply shifting responsibility onto consumers and encouraging them to make better housing ‘choices’ is unlikely to achieve significant change regarding the types of housing people expect and aspire towards. 4. Planning and policy development by State and local governments needs to involve collective engagement with the community in its broadest sense (general public, developers, investors, householders, etc.) to assist in transitioning to meet challenges presented by climate change. What it means to have a ‘good life’ is often not compatible with the long-term sustainability of those lifestyles or broader community resilience and resolving these differences will require difficult conversations with the wider community. This engagement needs to provide spaces where people are open to the views of others from different sectors and fields of practice, where people can relax their grip on certainty about right and wrong and listen to the possibilities that emerge from open dialogue. __________________________________ The Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation is a partnership of Melbourne, Monash, La Trobe and RMIT universities.

50|$|The first points {{scored in}} Origin Football was a penalty goal by heavyweight Queensland <b>centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga - {{the first of}} seven goals from seven {{attempts}} he would kick in the match (on his 20th birthday no less), while New South Wales' winger Greg Brentnall had the honour of scoring the first try in State of Origin football following good lead up work by Kangaroos pair Graham Eadie and Mick Cronin. After an all-in brawl {{in the first half}} and leading 9-5 at the break, Queensland took over the game and with Mal Meninga kicking 7/7 goals defeated NSW 20-10, the first time the Maroons had won a state game over NSW since 1975. Queensland centre Chris Close was the standout player from both sides, scoring a try in the second half and was a clear choice as Man of the Match. From a standing start, Close received the ball only 25m out from Meninga. He then simply accelerated through a big hole in the NSW defense and evaded fullback Graham Eadie to put the ball down next to the goal posts without a NSW player touching him.|$|R
5000|$|In his test debut for Australia, {{back row}} forward Wayne Pearce {{was judged as}} the Man of the Match thanks to his {{defensive}} work and having a hand {{in a number of}} tries as well as backing up a break by Max Krilich and Craig Young to race away and score a 45 metre try with only French referee Julien Rascagneres anywhere near him. <b>Centre</b> <b>Mal</b> Meninga, playing his 4th test and the first of what would eventually be a record 17 Ashes tests against Great Britain, scored the opening try of the game after good lead up work by Peter Sterling and Pearce, then easily palming off Les Dyl and outpacing fullback George Fairbairn to score in the corner. Meninga also kicked 8 of 10 goals for a personal haul of 19 points. His 8 goals also broke the record number of goals for an Australian in a test in England, the old record of 7 had been set by Graeme Langlands in the second test of the 1963-64 Kangaroo tour (the famous [...] "Swinton Massacre" [...] test). It also equaled the most number of goals for an Australian in an Ashes test, the record was previously the sole property of Noel Pidding who kicked 8 in the first test of the 1954 series at the Sydney Cricket Ground.|$|R
