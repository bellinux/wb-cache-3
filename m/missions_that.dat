5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E

5|$|Although the Tang {{had fought}} the Japanese, they still held cordial {{relations}} with Japan. There were numerous Imperial embassies to China from Japan, diplomatic <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> were not halted until 894 by Emperor Uda (r. 887–897), upon persuasion by Sugawara no Michizane (845–903). The Japanese Emperor Tenmu (r. 672–686) even established his conscripted army on {{that of the}} Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at Fujiwara on the Chinese model of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the other}} <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> Connecticut Wing {{currently}} performs is the Long Island Sound Patrol (LISP) program.

5|$|The American Apollo 15 mission, {{the first}} of the J-series <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> {{featured}} both increased scientific capability {{and the use of the}} Lunar Roving Vehicle, landed in an area of the Hadley-Apennine region to the west of the Apennine Front situated between the mountains Mons Hadley and Mons Hadley Delta to the northeast and south, respectively. This landing site was selected with the objectives of exploring the Apennine Front, Hadley Rille, and other geologic features in the area.|$|E
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 {{began on}} 29 September, Carlo Alberto was {{assigned}} to the Training Division. She bombarded the fortifications defending Tripoli and provided gunfire support to Italian forces at Zanzur, Zuara and elsewhere in Tripolitania. She fired enough ammunition during these <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> her guns had to be replaced in early 1912. After the war the ship was transferred to the Aegean Sea where she remained until March 1913.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Canada {{formed a}} working group to examine {{replacements}} for the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, initially called the Multi Role Aircraft (MRA), later renamed as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). The participating nations all had ageing fleets that required replacing; but, as the requirements were so diverse, {{it was decided to}} develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> were previously undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft. Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968, represented by Air Vice-Marshal Michael Giddings, and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain, West Germany, and Italy in May 1969.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noire was {{developed}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. Windows copies of the game are distributed on two DVD discs, while Xbox 360 copies are distributed on three; the PlayStation 3 version fits onto one Blu-Ray Disc. A total of 16 cases—the game's form of <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> advance the game's narrative—were removed from {{the final version of}} the game as they would not have fit on one Blu-ray Disc; while five of these cases were later released as downloadable content, eleven cases from the departments Bunko and Burglary were completely removed.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to escort B-24 Liberator bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at Kahili Airfield and Balalae Island, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The {{first couple of}} <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> {{the squadron}} undertook were relatively quiet but, on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked {{by a group of}} 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero {{features}} a campaign mode consisting of 14 <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> {{can be played}} co-operatively and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete {{against each other in}} numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split-screen, system link, and the Xbox Live online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the Nintendo GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.|$|E
5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Saidor {{was soon}} in {{use by the}} Fifth Air Force. Its base at Nadzab was {{surrounded}} by mountains and was therefore unsuited for <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> had to take off after dark, {{but there was no}} such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a weather front that closed Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided on the runway, and two aircraft cracked up on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.|$|E

5|$|The 1888 World Fair {{was one of}} the era's {{major events}} in Barcelona and {{represented}} a key point {{in the history of the}} Modernisme movement. Leading architects displayed their best works, including Gaudí, who showcased the building he had designed for the Compañía Trasatlántica (Transatlantic Company). Consequently he received a commission to restructure the Saló de Cent of the Barcelona City Council, but this project was ultimately not carried out. In the early 1890s Gaudí received two commissions from outside of Catalonia, namely the Episcopal Palace, Astorga, and the Casa Botines in León. These works contributed to Gaudí's growing renown across Spain. In 1891, he travelled to Málaga and Tangiers to examine the site for a project for the Franciscan Catholic <b>Missions</b> <b>that</b> the 2nd marquis of Comillas had requested him to design.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} several <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering items such as keycards, explosives or laptop computers, which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player can pick up new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress through the next level. By beating any of these mini-games, the player can access them in the game's extras menu.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} is now the state of California was first visited by Europeans when Spanish {{explorer}} Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo visited there in 1542.

Nevertheless, over the next 275 years, California saw few settlers, mostly around the chain of <b>missions</b> <b>that</b> were founded there, both under the Spanish, and subsequently under Mexican rule.|$|E
