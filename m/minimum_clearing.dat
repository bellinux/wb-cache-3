40|$|In urban communities, {{there are}} often limited amounts of {{right-of-way}} available for establishing a large setback distance from the curb for fixed objects. Urban communities must constantly weigh the cost of purchasing additional right-of-way for clear zones against the risk of fixed object crashes. From 2004 to 2006, this type of crash on curbed roads represented 15 % of all fatal crashes and 3 % of all crashes {{in the state of}} Iowa. Many states have kept the current minimum AASHTO recommendations as their <b>minimum</b> <b>clear</b> zone standards; however, other states have decided that these recommendations are insufficient and have increased the required <b>minimum</b> <b>clear</b> zone distance to better suit the judgment of local designers. This thesis presents research on the effects of the clear zone on urban curbed streets. The research was conducted in two phases. The first phase involved a synthesis of practice that included a literature review and a survey of practices in jurisdictions that have developmental and historical patterns similar to those of Iowa. The second phase involved investigating the benefits of a 10 ft clear zone, which included examining urban corridors in Iowa that meet or do not meet the 10 ft clear zone goal. The results {{of this study indicate that}} a consistent fixed object offset results in a reduction in the number of fixed object crashes, a 5 ft clear zone is most effective when the goal is to minimize the number of fixed object crashes, and a 3 ft clear zone is most effective when the goal is to minimize the cost of fixed object crashes...|$|R
40|$|Current U. S. design {{provisions}} for lap splices of deformed bars in tension were developed primarily from tests conducted on beams with lap lengths not exceeding 40 bar diameters. But the provisions often require splices to be longer than 40 bar diameters. Recent structural failures have indicated {{the vulnerability of}} lap splices with length-to-bar-diameter ratios equal to or exceeding 40. In this study, the tensile strength of unconfined deformed-bar lap splices with different lengths is reexamined. The focus is on lap splices with length-to-bar-diameter ratios of 40 or more. The tensile strength of lap splices in configurations resembling those observed to have splice failures {{in the field is}} also examined. ^ Three series of tests (with a total of forty-five specimens) were conducted on specimens with lap lengths varying from 20 to 85 bar diameters. In series one, twenty-seven prismatic coupons were tested monotonically to failure in tension. In the second and third series, a total of eighteen beams were tested to failure. The beam lap splices were located in a region of constant moment. ^ The results in this study indicated that increasing the length of a lap splice beyond 45 bar diameters was an inefficient way to increase the strength of the splice. The results also indicated that a mean unit bond strength of 5 √f 2 ̆ 7 c (in psi) is not a lower bound, as suggested by current design provisions, to the strength of unconfined deformed-bar lap splices with a <b>minimum</b> <b>clear</b> cover of 1 bar diameter and a <b>minimum</b> <b>clear</b> spacing between bars of 2 bar diameters. ^ To address these issues, a new perspective on the tensile strength of unconfined lap splices is explored. It is suggested that, rather than setting a lower bound to the mean unit bond strength for design, an upper bound of 900 √f 2 ̆ 7 c (in psi) should be set for the maximum steel stress that can be developed in unconfined deformed-bar lap splices. ...|$|R

The thesis {{focuses on}} the minimum time clearing objective for link scheduling in wireless networks. We formulate the problem as a deterministic LP. We relate the problem to other works on capacity and scheduling. In general, the problem is NP-complete. We consider special networks where the additional structure makes the problem tractable. We argue that explicitly solving the linear program is implausible. And proceed {{to show that the}} problemis amenable to a greedy allocation scheme that only requires local information. Beyond the special case, we consider simple ring networks where in general, the greedy solution is sub-optimal. We solve the <b>minimum</b> <b>clearing</b> time problem for ring networks under 1 -hop interference model. We establish the sufficiency conditions for optimality of a greedy solution. We also provide the solution when these conditions do not hold. For this case, the solution depends on global information, unlike the greedy solution. However, the solution only has a linear complexity in terms of computation. The <b>minimum</b> <b>clearing</b> time problem can help us understand how the network is constrained under different load distributions. Ultimately, in the future we aim to use these insights to design a simple scheduling policy, with nearly optimal performance in a general wireless network.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} hedge against the inherent uncertainty of renewable generation is to equip the renewable plants with energy storage systems. This paper focuses on designing profit maximization offering strategies, i. e., the strategies that determine the offering price and volume, for a storage-assisted renewable power producer that participates in hour-ahead electricity market. Designing the strategies is challenging since (i) {{the underlying problem}} is coupled across time due {{to the evolution of}} the storage level, and (ii) inputs to the problem including the renewable output and market clearing price are unknown when submitting offers. Following the competitive online algorithm design approach, we first study a basic setting where the renewable output and the clearing price are known for the next hour. We propose sOffer, a simple online offering strategy that achieves the best possible competitive ratio of O(log θ), where θ is the ratio between the maximum and the <b>minimum</b> <b>clearing</b> prices. Then, we consider the case where the clearing price is unknown. By exploiting the idea of submitting multiple offers to combat price uncertainty, we propose mOffer, and demonstrate that the competitive ratio of mOffer converges to that of sOffer as the number of offers grows. Finally, we extend our approach to the scenario where the renewable output has forecasting error. We propose gOffer as the generalized offering strategy and characterize its competitive ratio {{as a function of the}} forecasting error. Our trace-driven experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve performance close to the offline optimal and outperform a baseline alternative significantly...|$|E

The potential for new plywood plants was investigated regarding the supply potential with spruce and beech timber from forests in North and South Germany and new processing technologies like e. g. defect clipping and jointing of the veneer ribbon. During peeling tests in two German plywood mills with 170 peel rolls from selected locations complete veneer ribbon surfaces were scanned and digitized. Defects (knots, splits etc.) were detected and statistically evaluated. A software was developed which is capable to simulate several processing methods: E. g. clipping between defects and jointing of clear areas vs. clipping of strips with a fixed width and post-sorting of the strips according to their individual defect frequency. Preliminary results show that simulated yield statistics reflect the visual grade of the logs. Moreover, processing parameters like defect tolerance, <b>minimum</b> <b>clear</b> area between defects and grade specifications can be changed to predict and optimize the yield for each peel roll...|$|R

Hole spacing was developed using longitudinal and transverse chemical penetration data from previous studies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a decision support tool for transient stability preventive control contributing to increased situation awareness of control room operators by providing {{additional information about}} the state of the power system in terms of transient stability. A time-domain approach is used to assess the transient stability for potentially critical faults. Potential critical fault locations are identified by a critical bus screening through analysis of pre-disturbance steady-state conditions. The identified buses are subject to a fast critical contingency screening determining the actual critical contingencies/buses. These two screenings aim at reducing the computational burden of the assessment, since only contingencies considered as critical are taken into account. The critical clearing times for the critical contingencies are determined. A preventive re-dispatch of generators to ensure a predefined <b>minimum</b> critical <b>clearing</b> time for faults at all buses is proposed, while costs are minimized.
