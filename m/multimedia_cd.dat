40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the <b>Multimedia</b> <b>C</b> (MMC) language to develop multimedia applications. The MMC language was designed to support operations with multimedia extensions included in all modern microprocessors. Although the idea to extend high programming languages to support vector operations is not novel, we show that integration of <b>multimedia</b> extensions into <b>C</b> is valuable. This is specially true for idiomatic expressions which are difficult for a compiler to identify. The MMC language has been used to develop some of the most frequently used multimedia kernels. The presented experiments on these scientific and multimedia applications have yielded good performance improvements. Although this paper discuses the use of MMC, the key features of the MMC language and implementation of its compiler are also presented. ...|$|R

In this study, the writer analyzed about whether or not Directed Reading-Thinking Activity (DR-TA) improve the studentâ€™s reading achievement of tenth grade at SMKN 4 Malang. This study was intended to find out whether Directed Reading-Thinking Activity (DR-TA) improved the studentsâ€™ reading achievement or not. The researcher used quasi-experimental research design. In this case, the experimental group was given a treatment using DR-TA and the control group was treated without using DR-TA. The population in this study was all of the students of first grade of SMKN 4 Malang which were divided into 28 classes and six different majors. The researcher used purposive sampling to select the sample. The researcher took Multimedia class as the representative of the population because from the result of final test in second semester it was found that Multimedia class has the lowest mean score compare with the other class. As a result, class <b>Multimedia</b> <b>C</b> was experimental group and Multimedia D was control group. Based on the result of data analysis in the post test of experimental and control group, the studentsâ€™ achievement in reading was better than control group. This was because the mean score of the post test of experimental group was 74. 625 while the mean score of the control group was 70. Moreover, after being computed by using t-test it was found that te was 2. 781 and the level significance of 0. 05 and the degree of freedom of 38, then the tt value were found 2. 0244. The data showed that the value of te was greater than tt. Therefore, the hypothesis stated that the students who are taught using DRTA technique show better achievement than those without DRTA technique are accepted...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} VLIW (very long instruction word) architecture with {{a single}} register file does not scale up well to address growing performance demands on embedded media processors. However, splitting a VLIW processor in smaller clusters, which are comprised of function units fully connected to local register files, can significantly improve VLSI implementation characteristics of the processor, such as speed, energy consumption, and area. In our paper we reveal that achieving the best characteristics of a clustered VLIW requires a thorough selection of an Inter-cluster Communication (ICC) model, {{which is the way}} clustering is exposed in the Instruction Set Architecture. For our study we, first, define a taxonomy of ICC models including copy operations, dedicated issue slots, extended operands, extended results, and multicast. Evaluation of the execution time of the models requires both the dynamic cycle count and clock period. We developed an advanced instruction scheduler for all the five ICC models in order to quantify the dynamic cycle counts of our <b>multimedia</b> <b>C</b> benchmarks. To assess the clock period of the ICC models we designed and laid out VLIW datapaths using the RTL hardware descriptions derived from a deeply pipelined commercial TriMedia processor. In contrast to prior art, our research shows that fully distributed register file architectures (with eight clusters in our study) often underperform compared to moderately clustered machines with two or four clusters because of explosion of the cycle count overhead in the former. Among the evaluated ICC models, performance of the copy operation model, popular both in academia and industry, is severely limited by the copy operations hampering scheduling of regular operations in high ILP (instruction-level parallelism) code. The dedicated issue slots model combats this limitation by dedicating extra VLIW issue slots purely for ICC, reaching the highest 1. 74 execution time speedup relative to the unicluster. Furthermore, our VLSI experiments show that the lowest area and energy consumption of 42 and 572 ̆ 6 amp;percnt; relative to the unicluster, respectively, are achieved by the extended operands model, which, nevertheless, provides higher performance than the copy operation model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Analysis on {{click-through}} {{data from}} a very large search engine log shows that users are usually interested in the top-ranked portion of returned search results. Therefore, it is crucial for search engines to achieve high accuracy on the top-ranked documents. While many methods exist for boosting video search performance, they either pay less attention to the above factor or encounter difficulties in practical applications. In this paper, we present a flexible and effective reranking method, called CR-Reranking, to improve the retrieval effectiveness. To offer high accuracy on the top-ranked results, CR-Reranking employs a cross-reference (CR) strategy to fuse multimodal cues. Specifically, multimodal features are first utilized separately to rerank the initial returned results at the cluster level, {{and then all the}} ranked clusters from different modalities are cooperatively used to infer the shots with high relevance. Experimental results show that the search quality, especially on the top-ranked results, is improved significantly.

This project is an attempt to decrease software overhead introduced by the oper-ating system during transmission or reception, in order to achieve a higher throughput and a lower load on the end-system CPU. This is accomplished by eliminating the quantity of time spent by the CPU in copying data between kernel and user address spaces.

40|$|The {{integration}} of intelligent networks (IN) and B-ISDN signalling is {{considered as a}} prominent and robust solution to the rapid deployment of multimedia application services. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} that the network can offer advanced services without significant modifications to existing broadband signalling systems. The IN/IB-ISDN signalling platform will include a set of new elements as the broadband service control point (B-SCP) and the broadband service switching point (B-SSP), which will provide all the functionality required for the processing of user requests for complex multimedia services. The performance of these elements and their protocols is a crucial factor for network design as it determines the total number of calls the network can admit with acceptable call set-up delay.

40|$|Kanji {{learning}} is demanding, complicated and time-consuming, {{but it is}} fundamental for adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) acquiring written communication skills in Japanese. This study examines how learners proceduralise kanji knowledge (graphemic, semantic and phonemic representations) with reference to a skill learning model. It also explores the type of kanji learning strategies drawn on by learners, and how these strategies are used. These learning processes are then examined in relation to participants 2 ̆ 7 performance outcomes. Following a naturalistic inquiry for the qualitative analysis, empirical data from multiple sources were obtained over two semesters of tertiary level JFL study during which learners interacted with the <b>multimedia</b> <b>C</b> A L L program, KanjiSensee (KS), developed for this study. The 17 participants, falling into three groups, represent a typical distribution for JFL beginner classes in Australia: students without any previous learning experience of Japanese (the 2 ̆ 2 no-J 2 ̆ 2 group), students with some learning experience of Japanese as an L 2 (target language) (the 2 ̆ 2 yes-J 2 ̆ 2 group), and students having a kanji background in their Lis (first language) (the 2 ̆ 2 yes-K 2 ̆ 2 group). Due to {{the small number of}} participants, one should be cautious in generalising from the results. Apparently however, while frequent interaction with KS may activate accurate production supported by self-testing and thorough practice of kanji, it may not always be associated with high performance. Learners 2 ̆ 7 negative attitudes toward CALL methods m a y be associated with low outcomes from the viewpoint of strategy use. The main outcomes of this research suggest that the salient impact of KS is its capacity to promote input enhancement, while text modification on the screen is invaluable for the various needs of individual learners in processing and retaining kanji information. Above all, the study showed that CALL methods and the transferability of strategy and kanji knowledge from Lis affect the choice of strategy use. Irrespective of the learners 2 ̆ 7 backgrounds and CALL methods, however, the 2 ̆ 2 Planning your learning 2 ̆ 2 strategy is essential for managing the whole kanji learning process while the 2 ̆ 2 Frequency 2 ̆ 2 strategy (repetitive writing practice) is indispensable for automatisation, cognitively and strategically. It was further found that contextual learning could promote the expansion of kanji vocabulary and text processing skills. Further study is recommended to examine contextual learning dealing with the introduction of phonetic radicals from the beginning level by designing a special 2 ̆ 2 help 2 ̆ 2 function in C A L L programs to sensitise learners to the phonological properties of kanji at lexical and sub-lexical levels...|$|R
30|$|There {{are good}} reasons to assume that CBA is {{bringing}} changes to assessment practice that affect organizational and technical aspects for schools and teachers, {{as well as the}} test-design itself (Jerrim 2016). The test design constitutes the framework, setting up test-taker interactions and working steps within the assessment, and has the potential to influence performance and results. In the literature, effects that are due to differences in test design are called “mode effects,” and studies describe a “difference between the latent competencies of a test-taker for two tests administered in different modes” (Kröhne and Martens 2011, p. 174). The medium of administration—in our case, computer versus paper-and-pencil—is therefore an obvious and central design feature from which mode effects can arise; “however, in practice, the simple distinction between the two test delivery strategies is only a convenient way to communicate a conglomerate of differences between the actual test administrations that might trigger mode effects and result in nonequivalent test administrations” (Kröhne and Martens 2011, p. 171). So one challenge is to describe design criteria in a transparent way for each test format, in order to form a basis for interpreting or judging the applicability of the results. Some relevant criteria at the test level that are usually used in empirical analyses are: (a) information searches, (b) <b>multimedia</b> elements, (<b>c)</b> response modes, (d) input devices, and (e) navigation.|$|R
