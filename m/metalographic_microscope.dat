40|$|Ductile {{cast iron}} with {{different}} copper content was precipitation hardened. Cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content was ferritized. That operation was ended with rapid quenching, and then aged. Cast iron with 1. 27 or 2. 10 % Cu content was spheroid annealing. After rapid quenching cast iron was aged. Not {{alloy cast iron}} with small copper content (0. 04 %) had a chemical composition similar to cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content. Such copper was for tests {{in order to obtain}} an answer for the question whether only copper is responsible for precipitate hardening effects. <b>Metalographic</b> <b>microscope</b> tests (LM, SEM) of mechanical properties (Rm, Rp, A 5, Z, K and H) and x-ray diffraction tests were performed. It has been stated, that hardening of ferretic cast iron let to obtain tensile strength above 500 MPa and elongation approx. 23 %. Precipitation hardening of ductile cast iron efficiently compensates reducing of hardening caused by partial graphitization and spheroidization of pearlitic cementite...|$|E
