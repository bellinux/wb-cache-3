5|$|Unofficial {{versions}} of the game, which {{share some of the}} same playing features, but also incorporate changes so as not to infringe on copyrights, have been created by firms such as Late for the Sky Production Company and Help on Board. These are done for smaller cities, sometimes as charity fundraisers, and some have been created for college and university campuses. Others have non-geographical themes such as Wine-opoly and Chocolate-opoly. There is also a version called <b>Make</b> <b>Your</b> Own -OPOLY, which allows you to customize all the game equipment and rules to your liking.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to <b>make</b> <b>your</b> enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E

25|$|During Barker's {{tenure as}} host, three pricing games were {{introduced}} that used his name: Barker's Bargain Bar, Barker's Marker$ and Trader Bob. Of the three, {{the latter two}} are not actively played on the show – Trader Bob was retired from the show in 1985, Barker's Marker$ was renamed <b>Make</b> <b>Your</b> Mark following Barker's retirement, and subsequently retired, and Barker's Bargain Bar has been retooled as the Bargain Game after a four-year hiatus between 2008 and 2012.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, some jam {{sessions}} {{with a group}} of musicians in London had resulted in two albums' worth of material, unofficially released without Vangelis' permission in 1978, titled Hypothesis and The Dragon. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn. A more successful project was his scoring of wildlife documentary films in the early 1970s made by French filmmaker Frédéric Rossif. The first soundtrack L'Apocalypse des animaux was released in 1973. In 1972, the student riots of 1968 provided the inspiration for an album titled Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit (<b>Make</b> <b>Your</b> Dream Last Longer Than the Night), comprising musical passages mixed with news snippets and protest songs; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the riots. He also did music for the 1973 Henry Chapier film Amore.|$|E
25|$|First-class cricket {{also has}} a number of {{strategic}} elements not found in baseball, simply because the maximum time duration of the game is fixed (which can be up to five days for Test cricket) and a match not completed {{by the end of the}} time duration results in a draw regardless of the relative score (Although, in domestic competitions a 1st innings lead is beneficial a team's final standings). By contrast, baseball games are played to completion regardless of the time duration and there is no possibility for a tie or draw (with the exception of certain exhibition games such as the MLB All-Star Game, or in the case of Japan, where games are declared ties after 12 innings). There are no equivalents in baseball of, for example, deciding when to declare or whether or not to <b>make</b> <b>your</b> opponent follow on.|$|E
25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could <b>make</b> <b>your</b> entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
