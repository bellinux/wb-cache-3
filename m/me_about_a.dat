So we just had to dig in and put everything to the side and really work on something ... we had no idea that it would turn out as good as it did. It was a great experience It took <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together. The good thing about the video is that we went in knowing we were gonna shoot the video onstage a few times. I was actually able to get my camera crew onstage" ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> day and a half to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up {{to talk to him about}} the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E

500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E

Piest left the store, promising to return shortly. When Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report on their son with the Des Plaines police. The owner of the pharmacy named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.|$|E
2500|$|... "CEO confidence—that look {{in their}} eyes, {{their view of}} the animal spirits—appears to be back in {{stronger}} measure than I at least have heard in some time. What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E

He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 {{days before his}} death: [...] "An extraordinary thing happened to <b>me.</b> <b>About</b> <b>a</b> month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been absolutely certain that I'd never again {{be able to do}} it.

2500|$|Wessler then {{recruited}} {{three pairs}} of directors—Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, and David and Jerry Zucker—to sign on to write and direct one-third of the project each. He then began working out a deal with a studio for the project, but the project did not stick. [...] "They ended up calling <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> month after we started negotiating the deal and said 'we can't do it' because they had political pressure to not make R-rated movies that were marketed to teenagers," [...] claimed Wessler. He then went to multiple other studios, but, according to Wessler, [...] "no one could understand what [...] was trying to do".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was in the}} {{greatest}} affliction {{at the loss of}} my son, and was consumed by a desire to know what was his position in the other world. God deigned to comfort <b>me.</b> <b>About</b> <b>a</b> month after his death, during a very restless night, I saw, as it were, the ceiling opened, and Dominic appeared in the midst of dazzling light. I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven." [...] Then pray for your brothers and sisters, and your mother and father, that we may all come to join you one day in Heaven." [...] "Yes, yes, I will pray," [...] was the answer.

If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E
