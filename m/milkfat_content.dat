50|$|Smetana {{is one of}} {{the names}} for a range of sour creams from Central and Eastern Europe. It is a dairy product {{produced}} by souring heavy cream. It is similar to crème fraîche (28% fat), but nowadays mainly sold with 10% to 30% <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> depending on the country. Its cooking properties are different from crème fraîche and the lighter sour creams sold in the US, which contain 12 to 16% butterfat. It is widely used in cooking and baking.|$|E
50|$|Skimmed milk is {{sometimes}} consumed {{with the intention}} of reducing or limiting calorie consumption. It has been argued that the reduction in calories keeps the body further from satiety, causing it to ultimately seek out the same amount of calories that would have otherwise been consumed, and in some cases possibly more or from sources less beneficial. The extent to which animal fat contributes to weight gain is also brought into question, along with claims that skimmed milk is more beneficial to heart health since non-skimmed milk has a higher low-density lipoprotein <b>content.</b> <b>Milkfat,</b> however, affects only large, non-dense (Pattern A) LDL particles, which studies have shown to carry far less risk of coronary heart disease than small, dense (Pattern B) LDL particles. Skimmed milk also contains almost no Vitamin A.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect ofthe supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; 4. 5 g of cis- 9,trans- 11 C 18 : 2 and 4. 5 g of trans- 10,cis- 12 C 18 : 2) on milk performance, milk fatty acid (FA) composition,and adipose tissue reactivity in dairy goats feda high-concentrate diet based on corn silage. Twentyfourmultiparous dairy goats in early to mid lactationwere used in a 10 -wk trial, with a 3 -wk adaptation tothe experimental total mixed ration that contained cornsilage (35 %, dry matter basis), beet pulp (20 %), barley(15 %), and a commercial concentrate (30 %). Goatswere randomly allocated to 2 experimental groups andthey were fed 45 g/d of a lipid supplement (either CLAor Ca salts of palm oil added {{on top of the}} total mixedration). Individual milk production and compositionwere recorded weekly, and milk FA composition wasanalyzed in wk 2, 5, and 6. In the last week of the trial,an isoproterenol challenge was performed for 12 goatsbefore morning feeding. The CLA supplementation hadno effect on dry matter intake (DMI), body weight(BW), milk yield, milk protein content, and lactoseyield and content, but it significantly decreased <b>milkfat</b> yield and <b>content</b> by 18 and 15 %, respectively. Thedecrease in milk fat yield was related to a lower secretionof FA synthesized de novo, of the medium-chainFA, {{and to a lesser extent}} of the long-chain FA thatare taken up from the peripheral circulation. The CLAsupplementation decreased the proportion of the sumof C 16 : 0 and C 16 : 1 and the sum of total cis C 18 : 1, andit increased the proportions of the sum of long-chain(C > 16) and the sum of iso FA without modificationof the total trans C 18 : 1 and the sum of FA synthesizedde novo (C < 16). During the first 25 min relative toisoproterenol injection, the maximal concentrations,the increases above basal concentration, the changes inarea under the curve, and the total area under the curve for glucose and nonesterified FA were not affected byCLA treatment. In conclusion, CLA supplementationassociated with a high-concentrate diet based on cornsilage resulted in decreased milk fat yield, increasednet energy balance, and it did not affect the sensitivityof the adipose tissue to lipolytic challenge in lactatinggoat...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the FDA {{mandates}} certain {{qualifications for}} something to be called granular cheese. The maximum allowed moisture content is 39 percent, and the minimum allowed <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> is 50 percent by weight of the solids. Regular granular cheese must either use pasteurized dairy products or be cured for at least 60 days at a temperature of at least 35 °F. Either cows' milk or cream {{may be used as}} the main ingredient. Other permissible ingredients include clotting enzymes such as rennet, coloring, calcium chloride as a coagulation aid, enzymes used in curing, hydrogen peroxide, and agents used to protect against fungi. The name granular cheese can encompass many types of cheeses; for example, Parmigiano-Reggiano is a granular cheese.|$|E
50|$|Although {{granular}} cheese can {{be created}} using any method that achieves the designated standard for physical and chemical properties, there is one method that is generally used. First, the milk or cream may be warmed and treated with hydrogen peroxide and catalase, producing water and oxygen gas. Then, a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture is added, and the product is treated with clotting enzymes to form a semisolid mass. This mass is cut, stirred, and heated to separate the curd and the whey. Increasing {{the amount of time}} between cutting and heating will increase both the final moisture content and the <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> of the cheese, thereby increasing the yield. There follows an alternating cycle of draining of the whey and stirring. After most of the whey has been drained, the curd is salted, drained, and pressed into the desired form. The remaining product may be cured if the original dairy products were not pasteurized. A common method of curing is to dry the cheese on racks for about a week, then to wax it and place it in coolers until the time of consumption.|$|E

40|$|Milk {{samples from}} three Jersey and three Holstein herds {{were used to}} {{determine}} if the degree of churning correlated with the initial milkfat assay, and also to determine if the churned milkfat could be measured as accurately as the initial milkfat using the Milko-Tester. Regression lines for the initial milkfat test versus churned milk- fat test fit polynomial curves. The degree of churning was greater for Jerseys than Holsteins and correlated with the initial milkfat test. The repeatability of initial milkfat tests vas 0. 98 for Jerseys and 0. 99 for Holsteins. However, the repeatability of churned milkfat tests was lower for both breeds, especially for Jerseys. This indicated that the churned sample could not be measured for its <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> as accurately as the nonchurned sample. Churned milkfat samples all tested lower than initial milkfat samples, thus the Milko-Tester Mark III was unable to provide an initial fat test estimate following sample churning. Cows were different from each other in the difference between initia 1 and churned milk fat tests. This suggested that cows which produce milk with a higher tendency for churning are apt to receive less reliable milkfat tests from central laboratories than other cows, when all milk samples are subjected to churning conditions...|$|E
40|$|Brewers’ {{spent grain}} (BSG) is a low-value {{co-product}} of the brewing industry produced {{in large quantities}} annually. This paper reviews the existing evidence regarding the phenolic component of BSG, focusing on composition, extraction and biofunctions such as antioxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities. Furthermore, the incorporation of BSG in foodstuffs will be discussed, {{including the use of}} BSG as an animal feed supplement and the potential of BSG to be incorporated into foods for human consumption. BSG contains hydroxycinnamic acids including ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid; which have shown bioactivity in the pure form (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic and anti-cancer). Phenolic extracts from BSG have also shown antioxidant potential, by protecting against oxidant-induced DNA damage, possibly by Fe chelation. Studies show that BSG has many benefits when used as a supplement in animal feed, such as increasing milk yield, <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> and in providing essential dietary amino acids. The incorporation of BSG in human foods such as cookies and ready-to-eat snacks has resulted in increased protein and fibre contents of the products, where the changes in organoleptic properties are controllable. It can be concluded that the phenolic component of BSG has potential bioactive effects, which are worth pursuing given that the inclusion of BSG into human foodstuffs is viable and beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is a {{considerable}} reason for economical losses in beef and dairy cows. Approximatly 30 % of all dairy cows develop COD at least once during their life time. COD {{is defined as a}} fluid filled structure on the ovary exceeding 25 mm in diameter with no palpable luteal structure present. It may be assumed that negative energy balance post partum causes pituitary insufficiency. Diagnosing COD by rectal palpation is reported to be unsafe. The objective of this investigation was to analyse the pevalence of COD and risk factors that are associated with cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cattle. 132 Holstein Friesian cows of a commercial dairy farm were monitored from drying off, beginning of transition period, at calving and post partum every other week until ten weeks after calving. Blood samples were collected, centrifuged and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis. They were analysed for aspartate amino transferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), Bilirubin, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glutamate dehydrogenase (GlDH), free fatty acids (FFA) and insulin. Net acid base excretion levels in urine (NABE), urine pH, body condition (BCS) and back fat thickness (BFT) were measured at the same time from eight weeks ante partum until ten weeks post partum. Urine samples were collected at the same time. NABE and urine pH were determined immediately. Every other week cows were examined clinically per rectum. After 50 d post partum the diagnosis of cysts was subsequently supported by ultrasound. After calving, twice weekly milk samples were collected and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis for progesterone. The samples of cows developing COD were analysed and compared to controls without COD. Prevalence of COD peaked six weeks post partum (18. 9 %). Six to ten weeks post partum, significantly higher levels of FFA and Bilirubin were observed in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. During the post partum period NSBA and pH level of urine of cows with follicle-theca-cysts were significantly lower than of cows without COD. Between drying off and transition we observed high increases of back-fat-thickness in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. We observed a significantly higher <b>milkfat</b> <b>content</b> and fat protein ratio in cows with follicle-theca-cysts on the first milktest day. The prevalence of COD increased with number of lactation. 	 Until 70 d post partum COD was found in 15. 4 % of examination by rectal palpation (n= 632). After analysing progesterone level 24 % of the cows showed ovarian dysfunction. From the observed 15. 4 % COD, 64 % did not show impaired cyclicity. In total there were more follicle-lutein-cysts than follicle-theca-cysts (61. 7 % vs. 38. 3 %). Scanned cows (n= 44) showed 63. 6 % follicle-theca-cysts and 43. 2 % follicle-lutein-cysts. After analysing progesterone, fewer cows (38. 6 %) were diagnosed of having follicle-theca-cysts and follicle-lutein-cysts (18. 2 %), respectively. Diagnosis of ovarian cysts, affecting adversely cows´ reproduction, made by single palpation per rectum or single ultrasonography are insufficient. Only analysis of progesterone profiles can clearly indicate ovarian dysfunction. The results of this investigation showed the enduring strain of the liver, caused by massive lipomobilisation (bilirubin, FFA) and latent acidotic (NABE, pH of urine) metabolism. Until 10 weeks pp the negative energy balance seems to have an effect on liver metabolism. Ketosis and fatty degeneration of liver increases the risk of follicle-theca-cysts especially 6 and 8 weeks post partum. The risk of cysts´ development can not be exactly predicted. The risk of COD can be reduced by assuring a smooth transition period limiting lipomobilisation and risk of acidosis. It remains to be investigated why cows under identical farm conditions and feeding respond differently to the stress of lactation. <br /...|$|E
