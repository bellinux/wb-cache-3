Significant funds were {{spent on the}} construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with <b>microfiltration.</b>|$|E
25|$|ELGA {{produces}} {{water purification}} systems which provide purified water and ultrapure water for applications {{in research and}} analytical laboratories, medical and clinical facilities. It incorporates in its water purifiers a combination of purification technologies, e.g. reverse osmosis, electronics-grade ion-exchange resins, <b>microfiltration,</b> ultrafiltration, degassing, ultraviolet photooxidation and electrodeionization. Products are designed to minimize {{impact on the environment}} at all stages - manufacture, in-service and at end of life.|$|E
25|$|NEWater is {{the brand}} name given to ultra-pure water that is {{produced}} from reclaimed water. Wastewater, which is called used water in Singapore, is treated in conventional advanced wastewater treatment plants that are called reclamation plants in Singapore. The effluent from the reclamation plants is either discharged into the sea or it is further treated in NEWater plants using dual-membrane (via <b>microfiltration</b> and reverse osmosis) and ultraviolet technologies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microfiltration</b> is {{a process}} that {{partially}} replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk. In this process, cream is separated from the whey and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the whey is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST pasteurization). The whey then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition.|$|E
25|$|Other {{products}} fabricated {{with this}} process include various ceramic membranes for <b>microfiltration,</b> ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, pervaporation and reverse osmosis. If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a supercritical condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained. Drying the gel {{by means of}} low temperature treatments (25-100°C), {{it is possible to}} obtain porous solid matrices called xerogels. In addition, a sol-gel process was developed in the 1950s for the production of radioactive powders of UO2 and ThO2 for nuclear fuels, without generation of large quantities of dust.|$|E
25|$|The Orange County Sanitation and Orange County Water Districts are {{planning}} for treated wastewater, currently discharged into the ocean, to undergo <b>microfiltration,</b> reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection. The purified water will be equivalent in quality to distilled water and exceed all {{state and federal}} drinking water standards. The purified water will be pumped to spreading ponds near the Santa Ana River for percolation into the groundwater basin, with some injected through injection wells along the coast {{as a barrier to}} seawater intrusion. Like the WRD projects in Southern California, the Orange County Water District has amassed a long record of successfully recycling water with its Water Factory 21.|$|E
25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by <b>microfiltration</b> using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, {{been shown to be}} flexible enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E
25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure <b>microfiltration</b> or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
2500|$|Tertiary {{treatment}} is sometimes defined as {{anything more than}} primary and secondary treatment {{in order to allow}} ejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem (estuaries, low-flow rivers, coral reefs,...). [...] Treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically (for example, by lagoons and <b>microfiltration)</b> prior to discharge into a stream, river, bay, lagoon or wetland, or it can be used for the irrigation of a golf course, green way or park. If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for groundwater recharge or agricultural purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, <b>microfiltration,</b> can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microfiltration</b> removes {{particles}} {{higher than}} 0,08-2 µm and operates within {{a range of}} 7-100 kPa. <b>Microfiltration</b> is used to remove residual suspended solids (SS), to remove bacteria in order to condition the water for effective disinfection and as a pre-treatment step for reverse osmosis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Microfiltration</b> {{membranes}} can generally {{operate in}} one of two configurations.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} the two {{filtration}} steps, <b>microfiltration,</b> is used to remove the cells from the reactor broth. Ceramic filters are used because, although expensive, they can last for five to ten years. High temperatures {{have been found to}} increase the flux of liquid across the <b>microfiltration</b> membrane, so a minimum temperature of 165 F is specified. A series of three ultrafiltration membranes are used to filter out proteins with a molecular weight of 5,000 Daltons and higher. The feed pressure to the <b>microfiltration</b> membrane is typically 65 psia with a transmembrane pressure drop of 40 psia. The feed pressure to each ultrafiltration membrane is 60 psia. Using these feed pressures and temperatures, typical transmembrane liquid fluxes are 108 LMH (liters per hour per square meter) for the <b>microfiltration</b> membrane, and 26 LMH for the ultrafiltration membrane.|$|E

5000|$|Cravendale is {{filtered}} using fine {{ceramic filters}} (<b>microfiltration),</b> removing more particulates and organisms than conventional methods. It is then conventionally pasteurised {{through the high}} temperature short time process, and bottled in opaque, rather than transparent containers. The combination of <b>microfiltration,</b> and a light blocking container, provides an extended lifespan of up to three weeks when refrigerated, for which a premium is charged.|$|E
5000|$|The {{permeate}} flux in <b>microfiltration</b> {{is given}} by the following relation, based on Darcy’s Law ...|$|E
50|$|Relatively recent {{developments}} are membrane bioreactors (MBR) which combine <b>microfiltration</b> and a bioreactor for biological treatment.|$|E
50|$|Flocculation {{is used in}} {{biotechnology}} {{applications in}} conjunction with <b>microfiltration</b> to improve the efficiency of biological feeds. The addition of synthetic flocculants to the bioreactor can increase the average particle size making <b>microfiltration</b> more efficient. When flocculants are not added, cakes form and accumulate causing low cell viability. Positively charged flocculants work better than negatively charged ones since the cells are generally negatively charged.|$|E
50|$|As {{separation}} {{is achieved by}} sieving, the principal mechanism of transfer for <b>microfiltration</b> through micro porous membranes is bulk flow.|$|E

50|$|Membranes: It {{increases}} water flow, {{retention and}} fouling resistance of asymmetric ultrafiltration and <b>microfiltration</b> membranes {{and is being}} studied as an anionic component in polymer fuel cell membranes.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} which {{constitute the}} membranes used in <b>microfiltration</b> systems may be either organic or inorganic {{depending upon the}} contaminants that are desired to be removed, or the type of application.|$|E
50|$|Like {{any other}} {{membranes}} <b>Microfiltration</b> membranes {{are prone to}} fouling. (See Figure 4 below) It is therefore necessary that regular maintenance be carried out to prolong {{the life of the}} membrane module.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microfiltration</b> modules are {{typically}} set {{to operate at}} pressures of 100 to 400 kPa. [...] These pressures allow removal of materials such as sand, slits and clays, and also bacteria and protozoa.|$|E

50|$|Iodine resins, if {{combined}} with <b>microfiltration</b> to remove resistant cysts, {{are also a}} viable single-step process, but may not be effective under all conditions.

50|$|Reverse osmosis is {{commonly}} used for desalination. As well, RO {{is commonly}} used {{for the removal of}} dissolved constituents from wastewater remaining after advanced treatment with <b>microfiltration.</b> RO excludes ions but requires high pressures to produce deionized water (850-7000 kPa).|$|E
50|$|Besides Depth Filtration, {{a number}} of {{membrane}} filtration methods are also used for different industrial applications such as Reverse Osmosis, nano-filtration and <b>Microfiltration.</b> The aforementioned processes operate under the same principle, by rejecting contaminants larger than the filter size. The main distinguishing feature amongst them is their effective pore size. For example, <b>Microfiltration</b> operates by allowing large particles {{to pass through the}} filter media, whilst Reverse Osmosis rejects all the particles except very small species.Most membrane filters can be utilized for final filtration whilst depth filters tend to be more effective when used in clarifying applications, hence {{a combination of the two}} processes can provide a suitable filtration system, which can be adapted to many applications.|$|E
50|$|Absorption {{intensity}} decreases markedly {{with each}} successive overtone, resulting in very weak absorption {{for the third}} overtone. For this reason, the pipe {{needs to have a}} length of a meter or more and the water must be purified by <b>microfiltration</b> to remove any particles that could produce Mie scattering.|$|E
