5|$|Geoffrey {{died while}} still in exile at Grandmont in Normandy on 12 December 1212. He was buried at a Grandmontine monastery near Rouen, {{where he had been}} living for a few years. His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the {{inscription}} on it was recorded by an antiquary. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a monk before his death.|$|E
5|$|Germanus (sometimes Germanus of Winchester, died circa 1013) was {{a medieval}} English abbot and Benedictine monk. He {{travelled}} to Rome in about 957 {{and became a}} monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Back in England by 964 {{he served as a}} monastic official before being named abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in about 970, a position he was removed from in 975. Germanus <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> abbot of Cholsey Abbey in 992.|$|E
5|$|McLure and Collins {{note that}} there was a bishop named Felix who held the see of Châlons in 626 or 627. They suggest the {{possibility}} that Felix <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a political fugitive as a result of losing his see at Châlons after the death of Chlothar II in 629.|$|E

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th century Old English Gospel of Nicodemus and Old Norse Bartholomeus saga postola, {{that she may have}} been considered a goddess with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a being only as a late personification of the location of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The oceans <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more {{hospitable to}} life {{over the last}} 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
5|$|According to Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Ricberht murdered Eorpwald of East Anglia {{in about}} 627, shortly after Eorpwald succeeded his father Rædwald as king and had then been baptised as a Christian. Following Eorpwald's death, Ricberht <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> king, a {{possibility}} that is not mentioned by Bede or any contemporary commentator. East Anglia then reverted to paganism for three years, before Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded jointly as kings of East Anglia and ended the kingdom's brief period of apostasy.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the changes}} {{described}} by Grimm's law had taken place, {{there was only}} one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives. They eventually became stops {{at the beginning of a}} word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonant, but fricatives elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or fricatives at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops <b>may</b> <b>have</b> first <b>become</b> voiced fricatives, before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>become</b> stops at first, softening to fricatives in most positions later.|$|R
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander {{during the war and}} Inglis <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor in the art of warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

5|$|In 886 Alfred took {{possession}} of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; {{as it had}} traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to Æthelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year Æthelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent {{the next three years}} fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health may have declined, and Æthelflæd <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the effective ruler of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville.

5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so {{it is probable that}} the species became extinct prior to 1800, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct in the wild even earlier.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was shelved, {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (Middle Neck Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not be open to traffic until 1975. The project was eventually shelved.|$|E

5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše in the 14th century BC, Qatna <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> part of his kingdom. In 1977, Astour {{considered}} Qatna a constitutent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named Adad-Nirari with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by Thomas Richter in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city {{in the domain of}} the Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a šakkanakku (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna's royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I's first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had his kingdom split between different Hittite puppets including Idanda of Qatna.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts.
