5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E

50|$|The US has rules {{requiring}} that certain deductions be apportioned among all income on a formulary basis. These rules are quite complex. Interest expense <b>must</b> <b>be</b> apportioned <b>based</b> <b>on</b> relative adjusted tax basis of assets that produce or could produce the {{particular type of}} income. Research and experimentation expenses <b>must</b> <b>be</b> apportioned <b>based</b> <b>on</b> either relative sales or relative gross income. Taxpayers must elect which base to use, and such election applies for five years. State income taxes <b>must</b> <b>be</b> apportioned <b>based</b> <b>on</b> complex formulae.

Note that few other countries have developed rules to this level of complexity and specificity.|$|R

25|$|Al-Rodhan {{therefore}} {{recommends that}} fairness {{in terms of}} the participants in dialogue is a prerequisite for the promotion of universal justice. Similarly, he argues that diplomacy <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> openness to hearing and acknowledging the concerns and positions of others. Empathy and an acknowledgement of the grievances and past pains of others are crucial, as is giving all stakeholders a voice in the decision-making process. Finally, Al-Rodhan argues that all states, no matter how powerful, must be bound by international law and its obligations.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{fields are}} {{commonly}} {{divided into two}} major groups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These are both empirical sciences, which means their knowledge <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions. There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that effective teaching <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> positive reinforcement which is, he argued, {{more effective at}} changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, {{if a child is}} forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E

The party sees UN recognition of a Palestinian state as a pathway toward negotiations, and calls for the following immediate steps to be taken: Stopping settlement construction, paying Israeli residents of the West Bank to leave willingly and removing the naval blockade on the Gaza Strip in a gradual and coordinated way.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, {{does not depend on}} empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E
25|$|TNF is {{a protein}} that is {{released}} by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and {{more damage to}} the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. Infliximab {{was approved by the}} FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. Infliximab works better when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but a corresponding increase in adverse events means that the decision to use one drug or two <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an individualized discussion between the patient and their doctor.|$|E

25|$|Other scholars, {{propose a}} period between 7th and 6th century, for example, c. 650–600 BCE or 559–522 BCE. The latest {{possible}} date is the mid 6th century, {{at the time}} of Achaemenid Empire's Darius I, or his predecessor Cyrus the Great. This date gains credence mainly on the thesis that certain figures <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> historical facts, thus some have related the mythical Vishtaspa with Darius I's father Vishtaspa (or Hystaspes in Greek) with the account on Zoroasters life. However, in the Avesta it should not be ignored that Vishtaspa's son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, Darius I would not ignore to include his patron-father in the Behistun Inscription. A different proposed conclusion is that Darius I's father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by Arsames.|$|E
25|$|Al-Banna {{believed}} the Quran and Sunnah constitute a perfect {{way of life}} and social and political organization that God has set out for man. Islamic governments <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> this system and eventually unified in a Caliphate. The Muslim Brotherhood's goal, as stated by its founder al-Banna was to drive out British colonial and other Western influences, reclaim Islam's manifest destiny—an empire, stretching from Spain to Indonesia. The Brotherhood preaches that Islam will bring social justice, the eradication of poverty, corruption and sinful behavior, and political freedom (to the extent allowed by the laws of Islam). Blended with methods of modern social sciences, some key thinkers of Brotherhood have also contemplated the Islamic perspective on bureaucratic effectiveness, mapping out solutions to problems of formalism and irresponsiveness to public concerns in public administration, which pertains to the pro-democratic tenets of Muslim Brotherhood. Such variations of thoughts have also purportedly negated the realities of contemporary Muslim countries as their authors have proclaimed.|$|E

It also promoted the Malay language above others. This government intervention into culture has caused resentment among non-Malays who feel their cultural freedom was lessened.

500|$|The {{book also}} {{explains}} {{the philosophy of}} social determinism held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the welfare state and the socialist tenets within it help feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in {{that they believe that}} their actions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them. Those patients that Dalrymple speaks with [...] "seem surprised and tell him that he's the first person they've ever talked to who suggests that they can change their lives for the better," [...] further emphasising the mindset in which their society has placed them.|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts.

Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you think it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode {{would be one of the}} rare entries where Scully's version of the events would be vindicated, but in the end Mulder, once again, put everything together.|$|E
