5|$|Rothbard {{accepted}} the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing {{that if an}} individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally, and that after that time it is private property which <b>may</b> <b>change</b> hands only by trade or gift.|$|E

5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and <b>may</b> <b>change</b> with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and <b>may</b> <b>change</b> with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Aphasia is {{the result}} of damage to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each <b>may</b> <b>change</b> as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have {{erupted in}} Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, {{and an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year. A geyser's eruptive {{activity}} <b>may</b> <b>change</b> or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention.|$|E

5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies <b>may</b> <b>change</b> position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures <b>may</b> <b>change</b> brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|Galactic habitable-zone {{theory has}} been criticized due to an {{inability}} to quantify accurately the factors making a region of a galaxy favorable {{for the emergence of}} life. In addition, computer simulations suggest that stars <b>may</b> <b>change</b> their orbits around the galactic center significantly, therefore challenging {{at least part of the}} view that some galactic areas are necessarily more life-supporting than others.|$|E
5|$|In {{all cases}} {{this means that}} the {{position}} of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves <b>may</b> <b>change</b> dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, private {{companies}} pay for weather forecasts tailored {{to their needs}} {{so that they can}} increase their profits or avoid large losses. For example, supermarket chains <b>may</b> <b>change</b> the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions. Weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market, such as futures in oranges, corn, soybeans, and oil.|$|E

The player <b>may</b> <b>change</b> {{the level of difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E

In addition, traditional and popular sports throughout the Americas {{which are not}} contested at the Olympic Games are also contested such as bowling and baseball.

5|$|The dusky woodswallow has a {{very large}} range. The {{population}} size of this bird {{has not yet been}} quantified or estimated. It is, however, expected to be as populous as other birds within its densest range labeled 'common'. Because of this, the dusky woodswallow is evaluated to be of Least Concern (LC). This classification <b>may</b> <b>change</b> with new evidence, so is not to be taken with complete accuracy.|$|E
