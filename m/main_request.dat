Junior doctors generally want to improve their skills and do the best for their patients, but are unsure how to speak to a radiologist. They are often anxious because of uncertainty about which information is essential, which examinations are appropriate, and what patient preparation is necessary. It seems that in this respect, referring consultants from other specialties does not always offer enough insight into why they are planning a certain investigation and leave it to the junior doctors to come down to radiology to request them urgently. They can subsequently feel a bit “lost” in our department, and perhaps rather afraid of getting it wrong and being “told off” by a radiologist.|$|E

To find the employers’ opinions, we carried out a national questionnaire-based survey, answered by a total of 825 employers. The results showed that the employers’ priority is to increase the quality of this form of education, especially by emphasizing its practical aspects and links with the realities of the economy and the labour market.

40|$|This {{article is}} about the suicide of {{the chief of police}} of a small Canadian town, which - {{according}} to some - did not actually happen. While employed as a researcher and writer with a museum in Port Moody, British Columbia, the author heard this story as one of many told by the ‘old-timers’ who assisted with the writing of a history book. The controversy over the potential suicide provided the means by which this article reflects on issues of ethics, advocacy, and performance when doing public history. The <b>main</b> <b>request</b> of the old-timers was to ‘put the good stories in’ when writing the book.

This article draws on Anthropological theories of ‘complicity’ and performance in storytelling {{to make sense of the}} author’s role within the context of a museum working to record the stories of long-time residents. The stories of the old-timers were filtered through the lens of early 20 th century ideas about gender, race, and class, and affected by a lingering frontier mentality.

The story of the police chief’s suicide betrayed this intent, allowing for an analysis of how these expectations can affect the way in which public history is done...|$|E
40|$|The child {{protection}} system in Queensland, Australia is being radically overhauled {{with a view}} to ensuring a greater focus on child safety matters. One major factor that will remain constant will be the use of approved foster carers to care for children who need out-of-home care. Foster carers have been called the "the ultimate community volunteers". They have the responsibility to care for children and young people with increasingly complex and challenging behaviours. The <b>main</b> <b>request</b> from foster carers is greater support from the Department of Communities (soon to be the Department of Child Safety).

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{acceptance}} that technology {{is here to}} stay and if Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) ignore this they do so 'at their peril ' (Sloman, 2001). Aware of this the University of Bedfordshire have recognised that in order to expand and transform the traditional learning experience, for both students and teachers, they must embrace e-technologies and rise to the challenges these present. This need was further highlighted following an audit to establish why a large number of students who had shown an interest in the Public Health Masters did not enrol for this course. This audit, of a group of potential students, clearly indicated that the demographics of postgraduate students is changing. Amongst the group a large number were mature students, with slightly more females, who would need to juggle family responsibilities with a return to study. Additionally, it identified that interest was not just local but global; with the majority of enquiries coming from individuals from developing countries. The clear message from this audit was that the 80 % attendance requirement was the primary reason for them not enrolling on this taught course. The <b>main</b> <b>request</b> was for a course to be delivered using a distance learning approach.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under {{construction}} at CERN will give high luminosities to experiments covering six {{orders of magnitude}} from of 1028 cm- 2 s- 1 to 1034 cm- 2 s- 1. A new approach is needed to measure the LHC luminosity. This work reports the study of a LHC luminosity monitor based {{on the concept of}} Secondary Emission Chamber (SEC). The <b>main</b> <b>request</b> for such a detector is to cover the six orders of magnitude of the LHC luminosity range. Its precision is expected to be of the order of 2 %. The TOTEM collaboration proposes to calibrate the monitor at low luminosity. The construction of the detector based on the previous SECs developed years ago at CERN is presented. The performances of the new prototype are determined for incident currents between ~ 10 - 12 A and 10 - 13 A. The tests lead to conclude that at the LHC the SEC will be able to measure luminosity with a precision of 3 % within 1 s for luminosity above 1031 cm- 2 s- 1. A conversion of the SEC into an Ionisation Chamber (IC) is proposed to cover the LHC low luminosity region. It is achieved by filling the SEC with argon at atmospheric pressure. The IC response is found to be linear with the foreseen precision over the full experimental range of intensity corresponding to currents between 10 - 15 A and 10 - 12 A. The linear continuity between the responses of the monitor in the SEC and the IC modes is observed. We propose to use, at the LHC, the detector in the IC mode at low luminosity and in the SEC mode at high luminosity with a switch in mode at a luminosity of ~ 1031 cm- 2 s- 1...|$|E
40|$|In 1844, Serbian patriarch Josif Rajačić {{served two}} central annual Liturgies, at the feasts of Pasha and Penticost, in the Greek church of Holy Trinity in Vienna; these were {{accompanied}} by the four-part choral music. The appearance of new music in several orthodox temples in Habsburg Monarchy (including this one) {{during the first half}} of the nineteenth century, became an additional problem in a long chain of troubles that had disturbed the ever imperiled relations between the local churches in Balkans, especially the Greek and Serbian Orthodox. The official epistle that was sent from the ecomenical throne to all sister orthodox churches, with the <b>main</b> <b>request</b> to halt this strange and untraditional musical practice, provoked reactions from Serbian spiritual leader, who actually blessed the introduction of polyphonic music, and the members of Greek parish at the church of St. George in Vienna, who were also involved with it. The correspondence between Vienna and Constantinople reflected two opposite perceptions. The first one could named “traditional” and the other one “enlightening”, because of the apologies for the musical reform based on the unequivocal ideology of Enlightenment. In this article the pro et contra arguments for the new music tendencies in Greek and Serbian orthodox churches are analyzed mainly from the viewpoint of the theological discourse, including the two phenomena that seriously endangered the very entity of Orthodox faith. The first phenomenon is the ethnophiletism which, from the Byzantine era to the modern age, was gradually dividing the unique and single body of Orthodox church into the so-called “national” churches, guided by their own, almost political interests, often at odds with the interests of other sister churches. The second phenomenon is the Westernization of the “Orthodox soul” that came as a sad result of countless efforts of orthodox theological leaders to defend the Orthodox independence from the aggressive Roman Catholic proselytism. “The Babylonian captivity of the Orthodox church”, as Georg Florovsky used to say, began when Orthodox theologians started to apply the Western theological methods and approaches in their safeguarding of the Orthodox faith and especially in ecclesiastical education. In this way the new cultural and social tendencies which gripped Europe after the movements of Reformation and Contra-Reformation were adopted without critical thinking among Orthodox nations, especially among the representatives of the Ortodox diaspora at the West. Observed from this extensive context, the four-part music in Orthodox churces in Austria shows one of many diverse requirements demanded from the people living in a foreign land, in an alien and often hostile environment, to assimilate its values, in this case related to the adoption of its musical practices.

40|$|The need of {{evaluating}} teachers‘ work started to become increasingly stressed out both in Italy and Slovenia, {{with the aim}} to determine, who are those theachers that give effort in their work, that are succesful in {{what they do and}} therefore they are meritorious for rewards, pay rises and promotions in their job. We could link this tendency to the racionality of meritocracy {{which is one of the}} leading racionalities of today’s society. In its basis its <b>main</b> <b>request</b> is that every person should be rewarded regarding their abilities and the effort that he or she puts in his or her work. The rationality of meritocracy will be the main theme of this work. In the theoretical part its main concepts and critcs are presented as well as the meritocratic and nonmeritocratic elements who play an important role on giving (or taking away) the possibility of ascending the social ledder; the main meritocratic features of the racionality of meritocracy in the school and work systems are also highlited. The analysis of the Slovenian and Italian laws from the field of employement, salaries, rewarding and advancement, their comparison, their critics and advantages follow stright. The theoretical part ends with the presentation of theories in the field of social justice that show the right way of upgrading the concept of meritocracy. In the empirical part we used the qualitative analysis on 14 interviews (8 of them were individual, while 6 were group interviews). With this analysis I present the opinions of teachers, school headmasters and representatives of trade unions from Italy and Slovenia about employement, rewarding and advancement of teachers, which have their basis on the racionality of meritocracy. The results are presented by different contents – the categories that were achieved with the qualitative analysis. These are: the criteria of employement of candidates for teaching work places, the regulations of rewarding and advancement systems, opinions about the rewarding and advancement systems, opinions about the pay system, opinions about the teaching profession, the meritorious teacher, meritocratic, nonmeritocratic elements and opinions about the evaluation system with suggestions for its amendment. The research, based on the opinions of those who participated, proved that both meritocratic and nonmeritocratic elements (social capital and luck) have an impact in the employement process of teachers in both countries. Also in the Italian rewarding system and Slovenian advancement system respondents noted the lack of equal opportunities for teachers to get the reward or get an advancement in their pay. In the Slovenian rewarding and advancement system was mentioned the role of nonmeritocratic elements such as social capital and luck. The opinions about which teachers merit more than average teachers were very similar in both countries and between the different groups of interviewees. The majority of interviewees agreed on being dissatisfied with the rewarding system, advancement system and teachers’s salaries. Yet he opinions were more divided regarding the recognition of the positive and negative consequences of the rewarding and advancement systems on the motivation for better work quality and on the collaboration between teachers. ...|$|E
