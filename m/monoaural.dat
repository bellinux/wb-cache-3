50|$|A {{spectral}} cue is a <b>monoaural</b> (single ear) cue for locating incoming sounds {{based on}} the distribution of the incoming signal.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{popularity}} of the episode and the music itself the score has received several releases on CD in its original film version in <b>monoaural</b> sound and two re-recordings in stereo as well, one done by Joel McNeely with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (the only complete version) and the other by William T.

50|$|In audio applications, a {{vectorscope}} is used {{to measure}} the difference between channels of stereo audio signals. One stereo channel drives the horizontal deflection of the display, and the other drives the vertical deflection. A <b>monoaural</b> signal, consisting of identical left and right signals, results in a straight line with a gradient of +1. Any stereo separation is visible as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure. If a straight line appears with a gradient of −1, this indicates that the left and right channels are 180° out of phase.|$|E

50|$|WTTW {{has long}} been a pioneer in many {{technical}} aspects of television broadcasting, particularly in broadcast audio transmission. The station, in particular, participated in the trend of pop music-focused programs on television during the early 1970s (a few of which were also simulcast on local FM radio stations). When WTTW began production on Made in Chicago, the station made the decision to transition from <b>monoaural</b> audio to stereo for the FM broadcasts. However, stereo recording equipment for television production did not exist at that time. Because of this, WTTW engineers chose to modify existing Ampex quadruplex recorders to provide a stereo medium in sync with the video portion of the program. This innovation earned the station's staff a local Technical Emmy Award in 1973.|$|E
50|$|More {{expensive}} decks offered stereo {{audio recording}} and playback. Linear stereo, as it was called, fit two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with <b>monoaural</b> audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal's SNR {{to the point that}} audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied Dolby B noise reduction for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape's background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The most {{frequent}} complaint of the cochlear implant users {{has been to}} recognize and understand the speech signal {{in the presence of}} noise. Researches have been developed on the speech perception of users of cochlear implant with focus on aspects such as the effect of the reduction to the signal/noise ratio in the speech perception, the speech recognition in the noise, with different types of cochlear implant and strategies of speech codification and the effects of the binaural stimulation in the speech perception in noise. Objective: 1 -To assess the speech perception in cochlear implant adult users in different positions regarding the presentation of the stimulus, 2 -to compare the index of speech recognition in the frontal, ipsilateral and contralateral positions and 3 -to analyze the effect of <b>monoaural</b> adaptation in the speech perception with noise. Method: 22 cochlear implant adult users were evaluated regarding the speech perception. The individuals were submitted to sentences recognition evaluation, with competitive noise in the signal/noise ratio + 10 decibels in three positions: frontal, ipsilateral and contralateral to the cochlear implant side. Results: The results demonstrated the largest index of speech recognition in the ipsilateral position (100 %) and the lowest index of speech recognition with sentences in the contralateral position (5 %). Conclusion: The performance of speech perception in cochlear implant users is damaged when the competitive noise is introduced, the index of speech recognition is better when the speech is presented ipsilaterally, and it's consequently worse when presented contralaterally to the cochlear implant, and there are more damages in the speech intelligibility when there is only <b>monoaural</b> input...|$|E
40|$|The {{autoimmune}} {{inner ear}} {{disease is a}} clinical syndrome with uncertain pathogenesis that is often associated to rapidly progressive hearing loss that, especially at {{the early stages of}} disease, may be at <b>monoaural</b> localization, although more often it is at binaural localization. It usually occurs as a sudden deafness, or a rapidly progressive sensorineural hearing loss. In this study a particular form of autoimmune inner ear disease is described, Cogan’s syndrome. Cogan’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disorder that most commonly affects young adults. Clinical hallmarks are interstitial keratitis, vestibular and auditory dysfunction. Associations between Cogan’s syndrome and systemic vasculitis, as well as aortitis, also exist.

40|$|For {{more than}} three decades {{cognitive}} neuroscientists have debated the lateralisation of emotion. Currently there are two theories in contention: the right hemisphere hypothesis and the valence hypothesis. The right hemisphere hypothesis is that all emotional are predominantly processed in the right cerebral hemisphere of the human brain while the valence hypothesis is that positive (or approachrelated) and negative (or withdrawal-related) emotions are processing in the left and right cerebral hemispheres respectively. In general listening studies aimed to measure the lateralisation of emotion have employed disparate presentation procedures resulting in inconsistent findings. The current study investigated the affective judgment of simple classes of auditory stimuli (e. g. tonal/atonal melodies) via three presentation procedures: <b>monoaural</b> (i. e. target with no competition), binaural (i. e. target with competing noise), and dichotic (i. e. target with competing melody). Overall, presentation procedure had a direct influence on observed asymmetry highlighting the need for consistency in listening studies aimed to measure the lateralisation of emotion...|$|E
40|$|In {{each trial}} {{subjects}} presented monoaurally with single synthetic speech syllables. In Experiment I, when /ba/ and /ta/ specified one response, and /da/ and /ka/ another response, a right ear advantage in reaction time was observed; when /ba/ specified one response {{and all the}} other stimuli specified the other response, no ear effect was observed. Unsuccessful attempts to obtain a <b>monoaural</b> right ear advantage for consonants in some reaction time tasks might be due to some kind of prephonetic matching between a representation of the stimulus attended to and the presented stimulus, the output of this match providing sufficient information for response. In Experiment II, /bi/ and /bo/ specified one response and /bε/ and /bu/ the other response, but no ear effect was observed. It was concluded that the right ear advantage displayed for consonants in the corresponding condition of Experiment I was not the pure effect of a particular stimulus response mapping, but also dependent on the phonetic properties of consonants.

40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} naive human participants to examine any facilitation produced in manual reaction time (RT) by the interposition of a temporal gap between a warning signal and an imperative signal. Peripheral visual stimuli and <b>monoaural</b> auditory stimuli were used as targets. Participants showed a facilitation of RTs to the targets for both auditory and visual stimuli in the five experiments in which RTs were the dependent variable. In addition, the gap effect increased over successive blocks of trials, suggesting learning. RTs were facilitated only when the gap had predictive value and was salient. Using a variable temporal gap or a visual warning stimulus did not change the facilitation in RTs. A further experiment demonstrated that the gap can be perceived by the participants. The dissociation between a learned and a non-learned component in the gap effect suggests that the temporal gap induces two independent processes: warning and disengagement of attention. © 199...|$|E
