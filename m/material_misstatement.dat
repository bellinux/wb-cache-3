The rebuttal letter further delineated the separation between the electrification project and CHSRA and urged Secretary Chao to approve the grant by citing past precedent that only one low-rated project failed to receive a signature from the Secretary of Transportation over the prior twenty-year history of the Core Capacity program.

Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a <b>material</b> <b>misstatement</b> in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of <b>Material</b> <b>Misstatement</b> and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows: inherent risk × control risk × detection risk.|$|E

50|$|Detection Risk (DR) is {{the risk}} that the auditor will not detect a {{misstatement}} that exists in an assertion that could be material (significant), either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements. In other words, the chance that the auditor will not find <b>material</b> <b>misstatements</b> relating to an assertion in the Financial statements through substantive test and analysis. Detection risk results in the auditor's conclusion that no material errors are present where in fact there are. It is a component of audit risk.|$|R

50|$|The fraud-on-the-market {{theory is}} the idea that stock prices are a {{function}} of all material information about the company and its business. It applies to securities markets, where it can be assumed that all material information is available to investors. The theory states that under these conditions, there is a causal link between any misstatement and any stock purchaser, because the misstatements defraud the entire market and thus affect the price of the stock. Therefore, a <b>material</b> <b>misstatement's</b> effect on an individual purchaser is no less significant than the effect on the entire market.|$|R

5000|$|External auditor/ Statutory auditor is an {{independent}} firm engaged by the client subject to the audit, to express an opinion on whether the company's financial statements are free of <b>material</b> <b>misstatements,</b> whether due to fraud or error. For publicly traded companies, external auditors may also be required to express an opinion over the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. External auditors may also be engaged to perform other agreed-upon procedures, related or unrelated to financial statements. Most importantly, external auditors, though engaged and paid by the company being audited, {{should be regarded as}} independent.|$|R
5000|$|Factors such as independence, expertise, {{and extent}} of testing, among others, {{influence}} the quality of an audit. A high-quality audit is more desirable than a low-quality audit because it provides more assurance of detecting <b>material</b> <b>misstatements</b> that could mislead investors. Studies show that audits that are high in quality also lead to higher quality information in the capital markets and less information asymmetry between traders. Experienced audit staff {{and the use of}} industry specialists are listed as contributors of audit quality, which results in an increased quality in the transfer of information.|$|R
50|$|Due to constraints, {{an audit}} seeks to provide only {{reasonable}} {{assurance that the}} statements are free from material error. Hence, statistical sampling is often adopted in audits. In the case of financial audits, a set of financial statements {{are said to be}} true and fair when they are free of <b>material</b> <b>misstatements</b> - a concept influenced by both quantitative (numerical) and qualitative factors. But recently, the argument that auditing should go beyond just true and fair is gaining momentum. And the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has come out with a concept release on the same.|$|R
