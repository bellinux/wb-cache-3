40|$|The {{impact of}} the September 11, 2001, attack by Al Qaeda was felt {{worldwide}} with increased security measures. However, maritime security measures are not as encompassing. This thesis investigated the possibility of maritime domain terrorism threats {{and what could be}} done to prevent such attacks as modeled on the basis of system of systems. Only certain terrorist groups have the capability to launch maritime terrorist attacks. The terrorist motives are to spread their political message, responding to what they have perceived as oppression. The system of systems model suggests (and is validated) that container vessels and cruise ships are potential targets, with possible human and economic consequences. However, these maritime targets failed to match the terrorist groups objectives. Political assets such as warships and land-based maritime infrastructure align well to terrorist motives. Enhanced security measures protecting military and maritime infrastructure may require terrorists to use uncommon forms of attack.

50|$|Nereus weighed {{approximately}} 3 tons in air and {{was about}} 4.25 meters (14 feet) long and 2.3 meters (8 feet) wide. Approximately 2,000 lithium-ion batteries provided its power. The vehicle made use of precisely designed ceramic spheres rather than the much heavier syntactic foam that is typically used for <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Each hull contained between 700 and 800 9-cm (3.5-inch) hollow spheres that were specifically designed to handle intense pressure.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{underwater}} vehicle development, the hull geometry of <b>tethered</b> <b>submersibles</b> was developed from relatively simple hydrodynamic considerations. Modern untethered vehicles, on the other hand, require some combination of long range, high endurance, and high maneuverability, with a finite energy source on board. Their design must therefore be optimized, in which hydrodynamic optimization is a major factor. Sound hydrodynamic design requires a good knowledge of vehicle dynamics. Computer simulation codes can achieve this but require an accurate representation of the external forces and momnets on the vehicle (usually in the form of hydrodynamic, or stability, coefficients). The complex flow over a three-dimensional hyll with appendages makes it very difficult to estimate these quantities numerically. For this reason, a hybrid experimental-numerical approach is adopted. A five degree-of-freedom (DOF) test apparatus, called the Marine Dynamic Test Facility (MDTF), is being developed that can measure the hydrodynamic coefficients experimentally; the results are then the basis for modelling the forces and moments in a numerical simulation. The MDTF has application not only to underwater vehciles from small submersibles to naval submariens, but also to surgace ships, advanced marine vehicles, and offshore structures. It will be available to vehicle designers for the accurate evaluation of vehicle performance in a controlled laboratory environment. This paper describes the development of this important tool and presents the current status and its possible important application in the design of <b>submersible</b> and towed <b>vehicle</b> systems.

40|$|Nowadays, most ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) {{are of the}} {{free-fall}} and pop-up type. For the observations, {{they are}} dropped from ships and self land on the flat sea floor where generally thick sediments cover basement rocks. However, soft sediment affects and distorts incoming seismic signals. If we could place ocean bottom seismometers on hard rock, it could produce high quality seismograms which contained more information on structure and earthquake sources. For this purpose, a <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> is necessary as it can carry and place an OBS properly on exposed sea floor hard rock. We designed {{a new type of}} OBS which can be handled by a <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This new OBS contains instruments within two aluminum cylinders with syntactic foam blocks outside the cylinders for buoyancy. The submersible vessel, Shinkai- 6500, was used to set the OBS to observe seismicity in the Okushiri Ridge Area. It was placed on a relatively flat and hard basement outcrop at a depth of 3338 m. The OBS was releas-ed to the sea surface through a self pop-up system after two days of observation. During this observation period, we noticed very high micro-earthquake activity around the Okushiri Ridge area where one year later the Hokkaido-Nansei-Oki earthquake of M 7. 8 took place.

40|$|In {{the current}} version of NPSNET there are two {{problems}} that prevent users of this virtual environment from achieving a realistic training experience. First, the motion of the vehicles is not built around realistic, physically based models. In particular, the motion of computer-generated sea-going vehicles is not based on the hydrodynamic models that reflect the motion of actual ships moving through water. Second, vehicles in NPSNET are currently controlled by a single individual; they lack the capability to be controlled by a team. This misrepresents the many actual military vehicles—submarines, tanks, helicopters, and others— that must be controlled by several people working together. The approach taken was to update the <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> class in NPSNET in two ways. A physically-based hydrodynamic model was used to control the vehicle's motion through the virtual world. In addition, a network communications protocol was implemented to enable several remote individuals to control the same vehicle simultaneously. The result of this work is the creation of a computer-generated <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> whose motion is determined by a real-time hydrodynamic model so it moves through the virtual world according to physically based models. This submersible is also capable of being controlled by several remote individuals—effectively the same team members who would perform the job in the actual vehicle.
