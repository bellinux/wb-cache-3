5|$|In November 2008, Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> {{was named}} European Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards.|$|E
5|$|Like all of Danehill's {{offspring}} Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> is inbred 4x4 to {{the mare}} Natalma. This means that she occurs {{twice in the}} fourth generation of his pedigree.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Ascot, Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> showed {{improved}} {{form in the}} St. James's Palace Stakes. Michael Kinane {{tried to}} lead all the way on the colt-and was still in front inside the final furlong-before being caught and beaten a neck by Jamie Spencer on his stable companion Excellent Art, with another O'Brien-trained runner, Astronomer Royal in third, and Cockney Rebel in fifth. Two months later, Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> was moved up in distance and took on older horses {{for the first time}} in the International Stakes at York. He ran up to his best form in a highly competitive race to finish fourth behind the Derby winner Authorized, Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to make {{mandarin}} orange <b>marmalades,</b> in which sucrose is replaced by sweeteners, such as tagatose and isomaltulose, which are non-cariogenic and have a low glycemic index. Analyses of rheology, colour, antioxidant activity, microbiology, and sensory properties were carried out on <b>marmalades</b> on their first day, and after 90, 180, and 360 days of storage. The results showed that <b>marmalades</b> made with healthy sweeteners had a less elastic character and were thinner in consistency than those made with sucrose. Lightness was shown to be highest in mandarin orange <b>marmalades</b> made with tagatose, although colour was stable for 180 days to one year of storage. Tagatose also enhanced the antioxidant activity of these <b>marmalades.</b> All <b>marmalades</b> were microbiologically stable. Finally, <b>marmalades</b> made with tagatose alone scored the highest for global acceptance and intention of buying by consumers...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, British {{colonization}} of the Indian subcontinent relied on preserved food stuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and <b>marmalades.</b> (<b>Marmalades</b> proved unpopular {{due to their}} sweetness {{and a lack of}} available sugar.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} people {{suffering}} from insulin-dependent (Diabetes Melitus type I) and insulin-independent (Diabetes Melitus type II) is huge, {{and the number of}} potential diseased is in permanent rise. For that reason products with reduced amount of sugar have become very popular. Factory "Srbijanka" Valjevo manufactures reduced–sugar <b>marmalades</b> from apricot peach, strawberry, apple and orange. Low–metoxyl pectins and high-grade locust bean gum were used as gelation agents. Sensory evaluation and energy value of these <b>marmalades</b> were determined and all samples were highly graded. All <b>marmalades</b> belonged to the group of low-calorie (dietetic) products...|$|R
5|$|Australian Rieslings {{are noted}} for their oily texture and citrus fruit flavors in their youth and a smooth balance of {{freshness}} and acid as they age. The botrytized Rieslings have immense levels of flavor concentrations {{that have been}} favorably compared to lemon <b>marmalade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> raced {{against his}} stable {{companion}} Dylan Thomas {{again in the}} Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien {{was pleased with the}} run and said that Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> was still improving. On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.|$|E
5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> {{was owned}} during his racing career by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor, winning {{his first two}} races as a two-year-old in June 2006. He did not win again until the spring of his four-year-old season, almost twenty-two months later. During this winless period he was {{sometimes}} regarded {{as little more than}} a pacemaker for more celebrated stable companions such as Dylan Thomas. In his final year of racing he recorded wins in the Prix Ganay, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes. He was retired in October 2008 after running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> sired four European Classic winners in 2015, namely Nutan, Star of Seville, Simple Verse and Sound of Freedom.|$|E

5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> {{was then}} moved {{directly}} into Group Two class; {{he was sent}} to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> had been supported in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} it was {{discovered}} that a metal pin used to repair his previous injury had been causing the horse discomfort and was restricting his movement. The pin was removed, allowing Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> to run free of pain as a four-year-old.|$|E
5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground. He was settled on the outside, but when Murtagh attempted to have him move forward in the straight, he made no progress and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind Zarkava.|$|E

In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, <b>marmalade,</b> milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> (foaled 12 March 2004) is {{a retired}} Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. He {{is best known for}} winning five {{consecutive}} Group One races in 2008, for which he was named European Champion Older Horse. Upon retirement {{at the end of the}} 2008 racing season he stood as a stallion for Coolmore Stud, being moved between stud farms in Ireland and Australia (a practice known as shuttling). In July 2014 he was sold and relocated to Drakenstein Stud in South Africa where he currently stands.|$|E

5|$|Duke of <b>Marmalade</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} crop of foals sired by Danehill one of the most {{successful}} stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid.|$|E

Tokyopop released the first collected {{volume of the}} series on April 23, 2002 and released new volumes monthly until the final volume was released on August 5, 2003. It {{was one of the}} first manga series that Tokyopop released in the original Japanese orientation, in which the book is read from right to left, and with the original sound effects left in place. Tokyopop's volumes of the series are out of print. Shueisha refused to renew the company's license of the series after becoming part-owner of rival publisher Viz Media.|$|E
5|$|Using RAF aerial photographs, Crawford {{determined}} {{the length of}} the Avenue at Stonehenge before embarking on an excavation of the site with A. D. Passmore in late 1923. This project attracted press attention, resulting in Crawford being contacted by the <b>marmalade</b> magnate and archaeologist Alexander Keiller. Keiller invited Crawford to join him in an aerial survey, financed by Keiller himself, in which they flew over Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire in 1924, taking photographs of archaeological traces in the landscape. Many of these images were published in Crawford and Keiller's Wessex from the Air in 1928. In 1927 Crawford and Keiller helped raise the finances to buy the land around Stonehenge and present it to The National Trust to prevent it from being damaged by further agricultural or urban development. Previously, in 1923, Crawford had assisted Keiller in campaigning to prevent a radio mast being erected on the archaeologically significant Windmill Hill in Wiltshire, with Keiller later purchasing the hill and the surrounding Avebury area. Despite this working relationship, the two never became friends, perhaps a result of their highly divergent opinions and interests outside of archaeology.|$|E
