50|$|Sanzinia madagascariensis (also {{known as}} the Malagasy <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> or <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa)</b> is a non-venomous boa species endemic to the island of Madagascar. Two {{subspecies}} are currently recognized: S. m. madagascariensis and S. m. volontany.|$|R
50|$|A small animal {{building}} houses smaller {{animals such as}} the zebra mouse, giant Zambian mole-rats, pancake tortoises, dung beetles, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, African rock pythons, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> and Taveta golden weavers.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} also known for its herpetofauna. More than 100 species of frogs are found within a 30 km radius of Analamazaotra Forest Station. There are at least five species of {{chameleon}} including the brown pygmy leaf chameleon, Parson's chameleon, short-horned chameleon, nose-horned chameleon, and short-nosed chameleon. The forest station {{is also home to}} the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa.</b>|$|R
40|$|An adult <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Sanzinia madagascariensis) {{underwent}} coeliotomy {{for investigation}} of a coelomic mass. At surgery, a large mass originating from the peri-pancreatic adipose tissue and involving the gall bladder was removed. The snake did not recover from general anesthesia. A complete postmortem was performed, and samples were submitted to the University of Glasgow for histopathology. On histological examination, the mass was composed of adipose tissue infiltrated with a poorly demarcated spindle cell neoplasm. The neoplastic cells were highly pleomorphic with abundant cytoplasm and frequent clear cytoplasmic vacuoles, suggestive of adipocyte origin. Immunohistochemical characterization of the mass was inconclusive. Metastatic neoplastic cells were present within vessels in the liver, lungs, and brain. As an incidental finding, the gonads contained both maturing ovarian follicles and seminiferous tubules with intact germinal epithelium and evidence of spermatogenesis, along with other features {{of male and female}} gonad anatomy. The current report describes a rare neoplasm in snakes within an intersex <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Temperate Zone {{features}} {{animals from}} temperate zones around the world. The zoo's nine-banded armadillos Kirby and Penny. The zoo's rare three black-footed cats and cape hyrax {{can also be}} found in the Temperate Zone. The zoo's Siamese crocodiles Hillary and Bill live in the Temperate Zone during the winter. Other reptiles found in the temperate Hall include a <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> crested geckos, and Madagascar flat-tailed tortoises.|$|R

50|$|One hundred {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} on the reserve, of which 63 are endemic to Madagascar, including the endangered Madagascan serpent eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and the red owl (Tyto soumagnei), which is a vulnerable species on the IUNC Red List. There are also nineteen species of reptiles and seven species of lemurs: Indri indri, Propithecus, Varecia variegata, Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus and the aye-aye. Among the reptiles, there are nineteen species, including Calumma gallus, Calumma furcifer and the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> Sanzinia madagascariensis.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997, US Marshals and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, under Operation Chameleon, {{informed}} Tom that he {{was under}} investigation for wildlife smuggling for the third time. [...] In the 1997 charge, {{he was accused of}} conspiring with two German nationals, Wolfgang Kloe and Frank Lehmeyer, and a Japanese national, Koe Tomono, to illegally import over 200 reptiles and amphibians, including <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> ground boas, as well as a species of turtles, all species under the protection of CITES., Tom immediately fled to Belize, but he was extradited back to the US by officials there. Crutchfield was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Of his 1992-1999 smuggling activity, Tom stated {{that he was}} [...] "guilty because I'm guilty." ...|$|R
500|$|The most {{significant}} predators {{of the gray}} mouse lemur are the Madagascar long-eared owl and barn owl. [...] Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. [...] However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation {{does not appear to}} have a drastic effect on its populations. [...] Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native colubrid snake) and the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. [...] Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.|$|R
50|$|Early 2013 saw {{the opening}} of a new meerkat {{enclosure}} alongside the currently under construction reptile and small mammal building. In late March 2013, a new jungle gym for children to play in was built next door the safari skyride, replacing an exhibit that once held Indian muntjacs, Stanley cranes, and African spurred tortoises. The Indian muntjacs have been moved to a non-public area, the Stanley cranes had moved to the Safari Ride and the African spurred tortoises had moved near the orangutan island. In mid-April 2013, a Baird's tapir and a Ruppell's griffon vulture were added to the zoo, and can be seen in a safari-ride preserve area. A capybara was added to the South America yard in late April 2013. In 2015 phase 1 of the Reptile Building opened to the public to view various reptiles and amphibians, including the Komodo dragon. In August 2016, a new serval exhibit opened adjacent to the bat exhibit. The zoo will have new animals include pygmy hippos and giant anteaters on Summer 2017. On June 26, the reptile house was expanded with a new hallway containing 13 additional exhibits for 15 new species including rhino iguanas, rhino rat snakes, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> prehensile-tailed skinks, Dominican mountain boas, veiled chameleons, and emerald <b>tree</b> <b>boas.</b> Later this year, the African clawless otters will move to a new home near the playground, and two new primate islands similar to the existing ones holding chimpanzees and orangutans will be made to be viewed from the Safari Train Ride.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{species are}} {{frequently}} imported as display animals, the Amazon <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> C. hortulanus, and the emerald <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> C. caninus. [...] "Pet" [...] {{is not a}} term one would apply to these species, as most, if not all, have an aggressive demeanor and will strike readily. Their stunning coloration makes them popular, but their specialized habitat and feeding make them suitable only for advanced keepers.|$|R

50|$|Corallus caninus, {{commonly}} called the emerald <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> is a non-venomous boa species {{found in the}} rainforests of South America. Since 2009 the species Corallus batesii has been distinguished from C. caninus.|$|R
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy <b>tree</b> <b>boa.</b> Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|R
50|$|Corallus cropanii, or Cropan's <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> is a boa species {{found in}} the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Like all boas, it is not venomous. No {{subspecies}} are currently recognized. Until 2017, no specimen of this snake had been seen alive since 1953 and only five dead specimens had been collected since then, but in late January, 2017, an adult female Cropan's <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> measuring 1.7 m was captured by locals in Ribeira who brought it to herpetologists from the Butantan Institute and the University of São Paulo Museum of Zoology, who radio-tagged and released the animal {{to learn more about the}} species' behavior.|$|R
