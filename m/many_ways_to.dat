5|$|Because the Goathouse Refuge offers their 300 cats (number as of January 2013) medical {{treatment}} on-site, quality food, toys and comfort {{items such as}} lots of blankets, the cost of maintaining {{is higher than the}} average shelter. Contributors help in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the shelter, including providing items the cats need, donating money, or attending fundraisers. Scarpa's fundraisers use themes such as Burrito Bash, Venetian Carnival, Garden Gourmands, and Mad Hatter's Tea Party. These events are listed in such online and written publications as Raleigh's Indy Week, Chatham County's Chatham Chatlist, Chapel Hill's The Daily Tar Heel {{as well as on the}} Refuge's website and Facebook page.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, {{is that they}} were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – this had been a very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E
