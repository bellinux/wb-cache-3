50|$|Because of its bottom-living {{habit and}} the {{location}} of the Burgess Shale site {{at the foot of a}} high limestone reef, one may presume the relative immobility of Ottoia placed it in danger of being carried away and/or buried by any underwater <b>mud</b> <b>avalanche</b> from the cliff top. This may explain why it remains one of the more abundant specimens of the Burgess Shale fauna.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} of the dip of rock strata sometimes determines the degree of danger on a particular face; {{the character of the}} rock must also be considered. Where stones fall frequently debris will be found below, whilst on snow slopes falling stones cut furrows visible from a great distance. In planning an ascent of a new peak or an unfamiliar route, mountaineers must look for such traces. When falling stones get mixed in considerable quantity with slushy snow or water a <b>mud</b> <b>avalanche</b> is formed (common in the Himalayas). It is vital to avoid camping in their possible line of fall.|$|E
40|$|A <b>mud</b> <b>avalanche</b> {{occurred}} at Mt. Tukuba, Ibaraki prefecture, on July 3, 1938. In flowing {{down the valley}} it swept away two wooden buildings and killed three men. The avalanche was caused by collapse of soil in the upper waters of the valley {{as the result of}} heavy rains. The velocity of the flow was estimated to be less than 10 meters per second...|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the worst}} mudslides {{occurred}} in the Mount Hood Corridor, and one man died in a <b>mud</b> and debris <b>avalanche</b> near Rhododendron that destroyed 15 houses. Other deaths occurred from drowning and electrocution, and one man died when the new John Day bridge collapsed.|$|R
40|$|We report {{here on a}} laboratory-scale {{experiment}} which reproduces a rich {{variety of}} natural patterns with few control parameters. In particular, we focus on intriguing rhomboid structures often found on sandy shores and flats. We show that the standard views based on water surface waves come short to explain the phenomenon and we evidence a new mechanism based on a <b>mud</b> <b>avalanche</b> instability.

50|$|Examples of the {{application}} of geotechnics include: the prediction, prevention or mitigation of damage caused by natural hazards such as <b>avalanches,</b> <b>mud</b> flows, landslides, rockslides, sinkholes, and volcanic eruptions; {{the application}} of soil, rock and groundwater mechanics to the design and predicted performance of earthen structures such as dams; the design and performance prediction of the foundations of bridges, buildings, and other man-made structures {{in terms of the}} underlying soil and/or rock; and flood control and prediction.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{historian}} Samuel Dickson, [...] "... Sutro set off blasts of dynamite, ... {{leading the}} way for tunnel diggers. He fought <b>avalanches,</b> <b>mud</b> slides and poisonous gases. He dug air shafts to relieve the danger; the shafts filled with water, {{one of them to}} the depth of nine hundred feet. He fought cave-ins and solid rock. Through the grueling months, day after day and month after month, he marched ahead of his men, stripped to the waist, laboring with them, sweating with them, facing death with them, and in the end, winning through with them to victory." ...|$|R
40|$|Since 2010, {{recreational}} {{development has}} been permitted in strict nature reserves (zapovedniks in Russia), the most highly protected category of Russian Federal Protected Areas. As zapovedniks comply with the 1 b IUCN category for wilderness preservation, human activities within the reserves have been limited and, consequently, {{there has been little}} research on the natural hazard impact for tourism. The type of recreational use permitted in the territories and their buffer zones is called Educational Tourism. It is identified as “as a specialized type of ecological tourism where the main goal is an introduction to natural and cultural attractions”. Hiking is seen as one of these suitable types of tourism within the territories of zapovedniks, due to its low impact on natural features. As hiking trails are laid through natural landscapes, it is possible that natural disasters can both damage the infrastructure and cause fatal injuries for visitors. During the planning stages of trail construction, natural hazard monitoring should be conducted. Baikalskii Nature Biosphere Zapovednik in the Lake Baikal region is used as a model territory where scientific research and engineering are employed to better develop hiking tourism. Along with the monitoring of natural processes, several scenarios for trail planning, construction, and maintenance are being analyzed under the threat of <b>mud</b> slides, <b>avalanches</b> and floods...|$|R
40|$|Debris flows, {{snow and}} rock <b>avalanches,</b> <b>mud</b> and earth flows are often modeled {{by means of}} a {{particular}} realization of the so called shallow water equations (SWE). Indeed, a number of simulation models have been already developed [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Debris flow equations differ from shallow water equations in two main aspects. These are (a) strong bed gradient and (b) rheology friction terms that differ from the traditional SWE. A systematic analysis of the numerical solution of the hyperbolic system of equations rising from the shallow water equations with different rheological laws has not been done. Despite great efforts have been done to deal with friction expressions common in hydraulics (such as Manning friction), landslide rheologies are characterized by more complicated expressions that may deal to unphysical solutions if not treated carefully.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a three-dimensional model for simulating dense-snow avalanches, {{based on the}} numerical method of cellular automata. This method allows one to study the complex behavior of the avalanche by dividing it into small elements, whose interaction is described by simple laws, obtaining a reduction of the computational power needed to perform a three-dimensional simulation. Similar models by several authors {{have been used to}} model rock <b>avalanches,</b> <b>mud</b> and lava flows, and debris avalanches. A peculiar aspect of avalanche dynamics, i. e., the mechanisms of erosion of the snowpack and deposition of material from the avalanche is taken into account in the model. The capability of the proposed approach has been illustrated by modeling three documented avalanches that occurred in Susa Valley (Western Italian Alps). Despite the qualitative observations used for calibration, the proposed method is able to reproduce the correct three-dimensional avalanche path, using a digital terrain model, and the order of magnitude of the avalanche deposit volume...|$|R
