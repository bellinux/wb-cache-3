"We {{suppose that}} the {{circumference}} and diameter of a circle have been measured with a standard <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> infinitely small compared with the radius, {{and that we have}} the quotient of the two results. If this experiment were performed with measuring rods at rest relatively to the Galilean system K′, the quotient would be π. With measuring rods at rest relatively to K, the quotient would be greater than π. This is readily understood if we envisage the whole process of measuring from the [...] "stationary" [...] system K′, and take into consideration that the measuring rods applied to the periphery undergoes a Lorentz contraction, while the ones applied along the radius do not. Hence Euclidean geometry does not apply to K." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ehrenfest {{considered}} an ideal Born-rigid cylinder {{that is made}} to rotate. Assuming that the cylinder does not expand or contract, its radius stays the same. But <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> laid out along the circumference [...] should be Lorentz-contracted to a smaller value than at rest, by the usual factor γ. This leads to the paradox that the rigid <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> would have to separate from one another due to Lorentz contraction; the discrepancy noted by Ehrenfest {{seems to suggest that}} a rotated Born rigid disk should shatter.|$|R

2500|$|... 1737: French {{mathematician}} Pierre Bouguer made {{a sophisticated}} series of pendulum observations in the Andes mountains, Peru. [...] He used a copper pendulum bob {{in the shape}} of a double pointed cone suspended by a thread; the bob could be reversed to eliminate the effects of nonuniform density. He calculated the length to the center of oscillation of thread and bob combined, instead of using the center of the bob. He corrected for thermal expansion of the <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> and barometric pressure, giving his results for a pendulum swinging in vacuum. Bouguer swung the same pendulum at three different elevations, from sea level to the top of the high Peruvian altiplano. Gravity should fall with the inverse square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Bouguer found that it fell off slower, and correctly attributed the 'extra' gravity to the gravitational field of the huge Peruvian plateau. From the density of rock samples he calculated an estimate of the effect of the altiplano on the pendulum, and comparing this with the gravity of the Earth was able to make the first rough estimate of the density of the Earth.|$|E
