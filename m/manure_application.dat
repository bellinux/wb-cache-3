5000|$|With good management, manure has {{environmental}} benefits. Manure {{deposited on}} pastures by grazing animals themselves is applied efficiently for maintaining soil fertility. Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting. For many areas with high livestock density, <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> substantially replaces application of synthetic fertilizers on surrounding cropland. Manure was spread as a fertilizer on about 15.8 {{million acres of}} US cropland in 2006. [...] Manure is also spread on forage-producing land that is grazed, rather than cropped. Altogether, in 2007, manure was applied on about 22.1 million acres in the United States. [...] Substitution of animal manure for synthetic fertilizer {{has important implications for}} energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, considering that between about 43 and 88 MJ (i.e. between about 10 and 21 Mcal) of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of N in the production of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.|$|E

In this study, the Comprehensive Economic and Environmental Optimization Tool - Macro Modeling System (CEEOT-MMS) was used to evaluate the farm-level economic implications of alternative <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates for all AFOs in the 48 contiguous states of the U.
