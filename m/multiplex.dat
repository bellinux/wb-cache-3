50|$|Carrier systems {{typically}} transmit multiple {{channels of}} communication simultaneously over the shared medium using various forms of <b>multiplexing.</b> Prominent <b>multiplexing</b> methods of the carrier signal are time-division <b>multiplexing</b> (TDM) and frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> (FDM). A cable television system {{is an example of}} frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b> Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency. Multiple layers of <b>multiplexing</b> may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal. For example, in the public switched telephone network, many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time-division <b>multiplexing.</b> For long distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b> At a given receiving node, specific channels may be demultiplexed individually.|$|R

40|$|The volume {{holographic}} correlator (VHC) is {{a highly}} parallel processor. For an angularly <b>multiplexed</b> VHC, the processing speed {{is limited by the}} ratio of the maximum angle range and the minimum angle interval of the reference beam. Limited by the angle scanning range of the reference beam, the pure angular <b>multiplexing</b> in the reference beam of the VHC can only establish thousands of parallel correlation channels, which is far from the high parallelism demand for real-time applications. In this paper, the maximum <b>multiplexing</b> number of the VHC system is increased. The polarized and phase-encoded <b>multiplexing</b> methods are introduced into the object beam, with the angular <b>multiplexing</b> method in the reference beam. The mutual orthogonality of the polarization <b>multiplexing,</b> phase-encoded <b>multiplexing</b> and angular <b>multiplexing</b> methods are verified with experiment. This shows that the number of parallel channels can be increased with the object beam both polarized and phase-encoded <b>multiplexed</b> and with the reference beam still angularly <b>multiplexed</b> in the VHC. The optical setup is established and the feasibility of the proposed hybrid <b>multiplexing</b> method is experimentally verified. The two <b>multiplexing</b> methods extended to the object beam make it possible to establish more parallel correlation channels in the VHC. Although millions of parallel correlation channels can be realized with the proposed <b>multiplexing</b> method in theory, the paper presents some principal experimental results...|$|R

50|$|Statistical <b>multiplexing</b> {{is a type}} of {{communication}} link sharing, very similar to dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA). In statistical <b>multiplexing,</b> a communication channel is divided into an arbitrary number of variable bitrate digital channels or data streams. The link sharing is adapted to the instantaneous traffic demands of the data streams that are transferred over each channel. This is an alternative to creating a fixed sharing of a link, such as in general time division <b>multiplexing</b> (TDM) and frequency division <b>multiplexing</b> (FDM). When performed correctly, statistical <b>multiplexing</b> can provide a link utilization improvement, called the statistical <b>multiplexing</b> gain.|$|R

We study the problem of embedding permutations in PM and LM, and in particular, determine the threshold (minimal) <b>multiplexing</b> degree needed for a network to be rearrangeably nonblocking. We found that PM and LM are equally effective in linear arrays, and LM is slightly more effective than PM in rings, meshes, tori and hypercubes.

40|$|A novel compressive-sensing based signal <b>multiplexing</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} to further improve the <b>multiplexing</b> gain for {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial <b>multiplexing</b> in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial <b>multiplexing</b> streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the <b>multiplexing</b> signal into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial <b>multiplexing</b> signal of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS <b>multiplexing</b> data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS <b>multiplexing</b> signal. In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO <b>multiplexing</b> scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the great potential in further improving the spatial <b>multiplexing</b> gain for the MIMO system. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
