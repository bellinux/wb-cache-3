500|$|Technological {{advances}} began affecting sentence spacing methods. [...] In 1941, IBM {{introduced the}} Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing—which {{had been used}} in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. [...] This innovation broke the hold that the <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools. By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing.|$|E
2500|$|Opera Mini {{supports}} {{only one}} font, {{which can be}} set to [...] "Small", [...] "Medium", [...] "Large", or [...] "Extra large" [...] size. If a web page uses Courier or a generic <b>monospaced</b> <b>font,</b> the one font is still used, but the characters are spaced out so that each character takes up {{the same amount of}} space.|$|E
2500|$|Before the First World War {{virtually}} all English-language books were printed following standard typesetters' spacing rules. By {{the end of}} the Second World War most American books and an increasing proportion of English books were printed following the typewriter's English spacing approximation rules. Around this time, the practice of single spacing became more prevalent. There were various circumstances which could have contributed to the change. For example, there was an increase in high-volume low-cost mass-produced printing (e.g., newspapers, pulp-novels, magazines). Also, a significant innovation in the typewriter was the breaking of the typewriter [...] "grid" [...] in 1941. [...] "The grid" [...] referred to the uniform spacing of each letter space in the <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> used by the typewriter. In 1941, IBM introduced the Executive, a typewriter that used proportional spacing by [...] "breaking each cell of the grid into fifths." [...] Although proportional fonts had been used in various forms in typesetting since the invention of movable type, this innovation broke the hold that the <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> had over the typewriter—reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations.|$|E
25|$|Monospaced typefaces {{function}} {{better for}} some purposes because their glyphs {{line up in}} neat, regular columns. No glyph is given any more weight than another. Most manually operated typewriters use <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts.</b> So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in monospaced cells) in their configuration. <b>Monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see. <b>Monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> may also {{make it easier to}} perform optical character recognition.|$|R

2500|$|ASCII art usually {{requires}} a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> for proper viewing, {{with the exception}} of Shift JIS art which takes advantage of the proportional characters in the MS PGothic font. [...] In a web page, the <tt> </tt>, <code> </code> or <pre> </pre> HTML tags most commonly specify monospaced fonts. [...] In LaTeX, the verbatim environment or the Teletype font family (e.g., \texttt{...} or {\ttfamily ...}) uses monospaced fonts (in TeX, use {\tt ...}).|$|E

25|$|In the {{publishing}} industry, {{it was once}} the case that editors read manuscripts in <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> (typically Courier) for ease of editing and word count estimates, and it was considered discourteous to submit a manuscript in a proportional font. This has become less universal in recent years, such that authors need to check with editors as to their preference, though <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> are still the norm.|$|R
5000|$|Fixedsys is {{a family}} of raster <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts.</b> The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded {{characters}} are wider than non-bolded, unlike other <b>monospace</b> <b>fonts</b> such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named [...] "System". For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad.|$|R
50|$|Most ASCII art {{is created}} using a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font,</b> where all {{characters}} are identical in width (Courier {{is a popular}} <b>monospaced</b> <b>font).</b> Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospaced fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as Helvetica or Times Roman, where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.|$|E
5000|$|Even though {{computers}} can now display {{a wide variety}} of fonts, the majority of IDEs and software text editors employ a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> as the default typeface. This increases the readability of source code, which is often heavily reliant on distinctions involving individual symbols, and makes differences between letters more unambiguous in situations like password entry boxes where typing mistakes are unacceptable. [...] Monospaced fonts are also used in terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents. In technical manuals and resources for programming languages, a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> is often used to distinguish code from natural-language text.|$|E
50|$|Screenplays {{are almost}} always written using a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font,</b> often a variant of Courier or Courier New, both mostly used as 12 pt font. This is {{preferred}} due to its clarity. Screenplays are usually 90-120 pages long.|$|E

25|$|<b>Monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> are typefaces {{in which}} every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the w and m are wider than most letters, and the i is narrower). The first {{monospaced}} typefaces were designed for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> are still important for computer programming, terminal emulation, and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents; {{they may also be}} particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of monospaced typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.|$|R
50|$|Also called Lucida Typewriter Sans, {{this is a}} {{sans-serif}} <b>monospaced</b> <b>font</b> family, {{designed for}} typewriters. Its styling is reminiscent of Letter Gothic and Andalé Mono; a variant, Lucida Console (see above), replaced those two fonts on Microsoft Windows systems.|$|E
50|$|A <b>monospaced</b> <b>font,</b> {{also called}} a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and {{characters}} each occupy {{the same amount}} of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the classic}} Mac typefaces {{included}} with previous versions are still part of macOS, including the serif typefaces New York, Palatino, and Times, the sans-serif Charcoal and Chicago, Monaco, Geneva and Helvetica. Courier, a <b>monospaced</b> <b>font,</b> also remained.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{arguments}} against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> of the typewriter, and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.However, proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter, and remained for decades after its invention. When the typewriter was first introduced, typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences. This gradually shifted to two spaces, while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em-spaced sentences. Some sources now state it is acceptable for <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts</b> to be single spaced today, although other references continue to specify double spacing for <b>monospaced</b> <b>fonts.</b> The double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes, and that remains the practice in many cases. Some voice concern that students will later be forced to relearn how to type.|$|R
