500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{stated that}} the National Party members were as upset about Biko's murder as were blacks; [...] "The white {{community}} was thoroughly upset, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> nationalists themselves were very upset." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{technique}} Seitz {{used was}} [...] "venetian blind" [...] lighting which almost gives {{the illusion of}} prison bars trapping the characters. Barbara Stanwyck later reflected, [...] "...and for an actress, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> way those sets were lit, the house, Walter’s apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles – all that helped my performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood." ...|$|E

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You {{have enabled}} <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth. That is something. The truth has always stifled me.|$|R
2500|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> {{story of}} 'Please Please Me'. The record was {{released}} on the Vee-Jay label. It was a local Chicago recording company. The owner, Ewart Abner, brought {{a copy of the}} record to WLS. I was the music director at the time and listened to his story about a group, and looked at pictures in teen magazines he brought back from England. I figured, what if this group would get as popular in the United States as they were in England and Europe. So I added the record to the list." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, she {{has broken}} with her party {{on a few}} occasions. [...] She criticized George W. Bush for fielding {{questions}} from hand-picked crowds. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> difference between a GWB town-hall meeting – George W. Bush – and a GBW – Ginny Brown-Waite – town-hall meeting: I don't load the audience with just the choir," [...] she once said. She was one of five Republicans who voted against a bill to give Terri Schiavo's parents {{the right to sue}} in federal court to keep her alive (Schiavo's home was located in the 5th). [...] She is a member of Republican groups such as Christine Todd Whitman's It's My Party Too, Mike Castle's Republican Main Street Partnership, and The Wish List.|$|E
2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} LGBT rights {{movement}} in other arenas, LGBTQ activists began visibly advocating for greater representation in libraries in 1969. In 1970, the Task Force on Gay Liberation formed within the American Library Association. Now known as the GLBT Round Table, this organization is the oldest LGBTQ professional organization in the United States. Barbara Gittings became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side.

6000|$|... "Not just yet;--if {{you will}} keep <b>me.</b> To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, Mrs. Askerton, I {{do not yet}} know where on earth to take myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since you insist," [...] he replied. [...] "To-night, then, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> is <b>the</b> {{anniversary of}} the night when Louise Maurel consented to become my mistress!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> last time, Mr. Stillwell, that I {{know nothing}} of either," [...] said I. [...] "If any one has them that person is your son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Bartley. [...] "Something {{you got out}} of me {{when you}} were trying to make <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> difference between you and the other Equity girls?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{listen to}} me, Georgina. You say {{you rely on}} me as you do on no one else; will you hear <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> only way to be happy yourself--' ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What {{this woman}} said is quite true. But, Gertrude, listen to me. You don’t realise how I was tempted. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> whole thing. [Goes towards her.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{since you}} are so curious, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> watch, chain, and charm were {{presented}} to me by Miss Julia Carrington and her mother. Now are you satisfied?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will make}} another more unpalatable. Solitude I could bear,--and death,--but {{not such a}} marriage. <b>You</b> force <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> whole truth because half a truth will not suffice." ...|$|R
50|$|Aside: My father, if <b>you</b> don't mind <b>me</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> this, ate <b>the</b> muffin.|$|R
60|$|You {{would have}} <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> story, Grandchild? 'Tis a sad one and best forgotten--few {{remember}} it now. There are always sad and dark stories in old families such as ours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't touch me," [...] {{cried the}} man; [...] "don't. I can't bear it! Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, or I shall die. You {{think that you}} killed Farmer Morton. It's false! Mr. Marx killed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, not at school. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> whole position. Mr Ford and I {{did not get}} on {{very well}} together, and a year ago we were {{divorced}} in Washington, on the ground of incompatibility, and--and--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you take}} me for a sheep, sirs, because you see me wrapped in skins," [...] he observed; [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this, <b>the</b> lasso I lent you must be {{returned}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{messenger}} {{has just}} brought this," [...] he said, handing him a small packet. [...] "He bids <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> sender is {{a prisoner in}} the convent of St. Kenneth, on Loch Leven, and prays your aid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sire, he bade <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> that, <b>the</b> {{moment the}} beacon that {{announced}} the Feast of the New Moon was fired on Caucasus, the dreaded monarch of Karasmé, the great Alp Arslan, entered thy kingdom, and now overruns all Persia.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, {{do not let}} me see any one,' said Lily. 'Oh! that dear child! Robert, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> worst, {{for your}} {{kindness}} is more than I can bear. I promised Agnes a blister and forgot it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{says she}} is the handsomest vessel he ever laid eyes on, Miles; and let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> {{favourable}} opinion of so good a man as Dr. Moore, is of value, even though it be about a ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|LYDIA [Rising.] Then, sir, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> {{interest}} you had there {{was acquired by}} a mean, unmanly imposition, and deserves the punishment of fraud.--What, you have been treating me like a child!--humouring my romance! and laughing, I suppose, at your success! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Seer {{stroked his}} chin softly. His eye {{appeared}} to {{me to have a}} furtive gleam in it. [...] "Would <b>you</b> like <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> number of a bank-note inclosed in an envelope?" [...] he asked casually.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> alarm is false, {{and that}} no landing has been attempted. Now will <b>you</b> open <b>the</b> door and let me in? I am tired. I have been on horseback ever since daylight, and have come to bring <b>you</b> <b>the</b> good tidings.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{watching}} for you, Monsieur Guy. Father said it was as well that you should not, twice in a day, be seen entering his place. He bade <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> three gentlemen have been to him and will not re- enter Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Knighton, Master Heriot, {{from the}} Court--Knighton, the Duke's man. He {{brought back the}} salver you carried to Whitehall, flung it into the {{entrance}} {{as if it had}} been an old pewter platter, and bade <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> king would have none of your trumpery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How now, mannerly Mrs. Margery?" [...] {{replied the}} incorrigible Gillian; [...] "is your heart so high, because you dandled our young lady on your knee fifteen years since?--Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> cat will {{find its way}} to the cream, though it was brought up on an abbess's lap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So are we all," [...] said Cunningham. [...] "Oliver {{must not}} scruple {{to take our}} Scottish words for once. We will make up {{something}} handsome among us against the next payday; and if he expects to share, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> payday will come about all the sooner." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{is getting}} almost beyond {{the grip of}} the intellect, I know; but I do know that I have done this thing. And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> flying and {{crawling}} dreams of Big-Tooth were as vivid to him as the falling-through-space dream is to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} to marry some day," [...] she said dreamily--"both of us. We have so much money {{that we will not}} be allowed to {{disappoint}} <b>the</b> public. Do <b>you</b> want <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> kind of a man I could love, Sis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Correct,' says Doc. 'And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something: <b>The</b> next tune I {{learn on}} my flute {{is going to}} be [...] "Yankee Doodle." [...] I reckon there's some Yanks that are not so pizen. Or, if you was me, would you try [...] "The Red, White, and Blue"?'" ...|$|R
