5|$|Born in England, {{his family}} moved to New Zealand in the 1890s. He became a {{professional}} soldier in the New Zealand <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> in 1911. In Australia on an exchange with the Australian Army when the First World War broke out, he was attached to the Australian Imperial Force. He served in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front in a series of artillery commands. During the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, mentioned in despatches six times and was one of only 14 personnel of the New Zealand <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> to receive the French Legion of Honour. Returning to New Zealand after the war, he later served as Commandant of the New Zealand <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> from 1931 until his retirement in 1937. He died in 1964 at the age of 84.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments {{took time to}} develop. Indeed, {{it was not until}} 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} by American Presidents to use <b>military</b> <b>force</b> {{is a decision}} that is not taken lightly nor whimsically. This study attempted to determine whether any personal or psychological characteristics influence the President’s decision to use <b>military</b> <b>force</b> or to refrain from using <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> While other factors could influence the President’s decision, I believed that individual factors including personal and psychological characteristics {{would be able to}} most effectively explain the use of <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> Uses of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> were collected from a Congressional Research Service report listing all uses of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> from 1798 to 2015. The uses of force by each President were then cross-tabulated with the individual factors I was investigating. Based on the previous findings by Michael C. Horowitz, Allan C. Stam, and Cali M. Ellis that showed correlation between a leader’s personal experiences and the use of <b>military</b> <b>force,</b> I hypothesized that there would be similar findings among American Presidents. The results show that individual factors and personal characteristics may give little indication or its effects are overstated as to whether a President is more prone to use <b>military</b> <b>force</b> or less prone to use <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> Many of the results contradict existing literature, but due to the small sample size of American presidencies the results may not be truly representative. At best, it can be inferred that American Presidents aren’t as significantly affected by individual factors and personal characteristics compared to other world leaders and that other factors of explanation hold equal importance. Future research areas that may merit investigation include Presidential verbal syntax and operational coding...|$|R

5|$|The Australian Commonwealth <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> {{came into}} being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces—{{including}} those still in South Africa—became {{part of the new}} force. 28,923 colonial soldiers, including 1,457 professional soldiers, 18,603 paid militia and 8,863 unpaid volunteers, were subsequently transferred. The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation. This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia. However, the majority of soldiers remained in militia units, known as the Citizen <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> (CMF). Major General Sir Edward Hutton—a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces—subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth <b>Military</b> <b>Forces</b> on 26 December and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army. In 1911, following a report by Lord Kitchener the Royal Military College, Duntroon was established, as was a system of universal National Service.|$|E
