25|$|Limited ageing work on <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> has {{recorded}} fish to 20 years of age. Maximum age for <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> is probably {{similar to the}} maximum age recorded for the closely related golden perch (26 years).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> (Macquaria australasica) is an Australian native {{freshwater}} fish of the Murray-Darling river system. It {{is a member}} of the Percichthyidae family and is closely related to the golden perch (Macquaria ambigua).|$|E
25|$|<b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> were {{originally}} {{found in the}} larger upland rivers and streams in the south-eastern corner of the Murray-Darling system, which they usually co-inhabited with trout cod and {{one or both of}} the blackfish species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> are a {{relatively}} placid native fish species with {{the bulk of}} their diet consisting of aquatic invertebrates such as caddisfly, stonefly and mayfly species, with a small quantity of terrestrial insects taken as well.|$|E
25|$|Results {{from recent}} {{research}} using genetic MtDNA analysis indicate Australian bass and estuary perch do belong {{in a separate}} genus to golden perch and <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch,</b> and has resulted in Australian bass and estuary perch being placed back into a resurrected Percalates genus.|$|E
25|$|A rather {{surprising}} and unexpected finding {{of this research}} is that the Percalates genus (i.e. Australian bass and estuary perch) appears to be genetically closer to the Maccullochella genus (i.e. Murray cod and other cod species) than the remnant Macquaria genus is (i.e. golden perch and <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch).</b>|$|E
25|$|Diverse {{freshwater}} fish species are found within creeks in the park, including the <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> (Macquaria ambigua), {{which is a}} threatened species. The freshwater species Cox’s gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii), long-finned eel (Anguilla reinhardtii), climbing galaxias (Galaxias brevipinni) and the Sydney (Euastacus australasiensis) and spiny crayfish (Euastacus spp.) are {{also found in the}} park.|$|E
25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It {{has been linked to}} declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> is {{primarily}} an upland native fish {{and has a}} breeding biology clearly adapted to flowing upland rivers and streams.

[...] <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> breed in late spring at temperatures of 15 to 16°C, in flowing water over unsilted cobble and gravel substrate. [...] The demersal (sinking) eggs fall into the interstices (spaces) between the gravel and cobble, where they lodge and are then protected and incubated until hatching.

2500|$|Until very {{recently}} (i.e. late 2000s), Australian bass and estuary perch {{were placed in}} the Macquaria genus — {{one of a number of}} Australian genera in the Percichthyidae family — along with two species of native perch from the Murray-Darling Basin, golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and <b>Macquarie</b> <b>perch</b> (Macquaria australasica). This revision to their taxonomy occurred in the late 1970s. Prior to that, Australian bass and estuary perch were placed in a separate genus, Percalates. [...] (Interestingly, the generic name Percalates is a compound of the generic names Perca and Lates, and arose from an early, erroneous taxonomic belief that Australian bass were an old world perch related to barramundi (Lates calcarifer)).|$|E
