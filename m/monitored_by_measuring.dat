In July 1946, Turkevich and Seymour Katcoff suggested that nuclear explosions could be <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the atmospheric concentration of the radioactive isotope krypton-85, a fission product. Turkevich wrote a letter to Philip Morrison proposing that atmospheric sampling could be used to estimate the number of fissions that had occurred in nuclear reactors and atmospheric atom bomb tests.

50|$|Stereotypies are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a coping mechanism for animals experiencing stress. A physiological stress response can be induced by injecting an animal with ACTH and the animal's ability to cope with this stress can be <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> salivary cortisol. In a 2015 study, after ACTH injection, cribbers had higher cortisol levels than non-cribbers. Furthermore, cribbers which did not perform the stereotypy during the 3-hrs of testing had higher cortisol levels than non-cribters, whereas those performing the stereotypy did not. The researchers concluded that cribbing is a coping mechanism to stressful situations and that because of this, it should not be prevented.|$|E

Environmental <b>monitoring</b> was performed <b>by</b> personal sampling, biologic <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> PCE in alveolar air (PCE-Alv), blood (PCE-B), and urine (PCE-U) in 26 low-exposed dry-cleaners. Correlation coefficients (r) between environmental PCE and PCE-B, PCE-Alv, and PCE-U were 0. 94, 0. 81, and 0. 67 respectively. A high correlation was also found among biologic indices: r value was 0. 96 between PCE-B and PCE-Alv, 0. 95 between PCE-B and PCE-U, and 0. 87 between alveolar PCE-Alv and PCE-U. The examined biologic indices proved sensitive enough for biologic monitoring of low exposure to PCE and can give substantially similar information in terms of exposure evaluation. PCE-Alv offers some advantages because it correlated better with exposure and is analytically simpler...|$|R
50|$|To {{search for}} {{possible}} metabolites of DHEA {{that might have}} greater biological activity, greater specificity, and fewer propensities to form sex hormones, Dr. Lardy initiated a program assaying the derivatives of DHEA. The activity of 150 of these metabolites was <b>monitored</b> <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the induction of two thermogenic enzymes, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and cytosolic malic enzyme. The results of this landmark study {{were published in the}} journal Steroids in 1998 and revealed that many of these steroids did not induce the activity of these thermogenic enzymes, whereas the 7-keto-DHEA metabolite did. In fact, 7-keto-DHEA was 2.5 times more active than DHEA at inducing the activity of these thermogenic enzymes. In later work by Marenich, it was discovered that the urinary excretion of 7-keto-DHEA declines with age in a similar manner to its parent compound, DHEA. Based on these discovered advantages, the 7-keto-DHEA metabolite was chosen for further study as a weight loss ingredient.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing maintenance models of web offset presses, and to propose the method which increases the reliability of the printing press exploitation, but does not require big investments. Doctor motors allowed constant <b>monitoring</b> <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments, which allowed insight in current status of motors at any time, so they could be repaired or replaced before malfunction. The effective vibration speed (vRMS) was measured a few times during the year 2006. Standard ISO 2372 - 1974 (E) defines values and boundaries of the effective vibration speed (vRMS). Results of measuring effective vibration speed indicated the emersion of nuisance energy with deterioration. To determine the state of bearings, and check if they cause the increase of effective vibration speed, an envelope analysis- FFT of the acceleration specter is conducted. This decreases the probability of motor malfunction and greatly increases the reliability of the whole system...|$|R
