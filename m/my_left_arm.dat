[...] 'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't lift <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> higher than this'— and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference? [...] But when she said it 'hurts like f---,' she'd {{take a break and}} sit down for two minutes. 'I have broken ribs, {{remember}} that!' I just can't imagine dancing like that. Talk about priorities." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{looked down}} and <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> wasn’t there. When you {{get hit by a}} machine gun, it’s like {{somebody}} put a hot poker in you. I stuck the stump of my arm into the snow, but the warm blood melted the snow. I figured I was dying. When they rescued me, my arm had a cake of bloody ice frozen around it, sealing the wound. If it had been summer, I’d [...] dead." ...|$|E

60|$|I held up <b>my</b> <b>left</b> {{hand and}} <b>arm</b> before me, a grubby hand, a frayed cuff; {{but with a}} quality of painted unreality, transfigured as a beggar might have been by Botticelli. I looked for a time steadfastly at a {{beautiful}} pearl sleeve-link.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952–1953, {{while living}} in a burial place called Ghati, Baba Hari Dass {{described}} experience of a legendary Kumoan yogi Hariakhan Baba while staying in a cave in a cold wintertime. While sitting {{by the side of}} the fire he fainted and his left arm fell into that fire: [...] "I saw Hariakhan Maharaj come into the room and bend over me…, I saw him clearly, removing <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> from the fire pit... By some unknown power I was related to Hariakhan Maharaj." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My left hook was a heat-seeking missile, {{careening}} off {{his face}} and body time and again. Twice {{in the second round}} I knocked him to the canvas. But as I pounded away, I felt a jolt of pain shoot through <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm.</b> Oh damn, the thumb." [...] Joe would say. Joe knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, though he wasn't sure as to the extent. [...] "In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it's hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like how I was going to deal with Yemelyanov {{for the rest of the}} fight." [...] The match ended when the Soviet's handlers threw in the towel at 1:49 in the second round, and the referee raised Joe's injured hand in victory.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Strayhorn, {{originally}} {{hired as}} a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed [...] "Swee' Pea" [...] for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly {{of the man and}} their collaborative working relationship, [...] "my right arm, <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> all the eyes {{in the back of my}} head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or [...] "Duke's doppelganger". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is done at last," [...] said one; [...] "the {{worst and}} hardest labour I ever did in my life. I {{believe there is}} no luck about me <b>left.</b> <b>My</b> very <b>arms</b> {{feel as if they}} did not belong to me; and, strange to tell, toil as hard as I would, I could not gather warmth in my limbs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the door}} of their drawing-room she <b>left</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and walked in first, {{catching}} at the chairs and tables. She unpinned her hat, then, exhausted with the effort, her cloak still hanging from her shoulders, flung herself into a deep armchair, sideways, her face half buried in a cushion. The good brother appeared silently before her {{with a glass of}} water. She motioned it away. He drank it himself and walked off to a distant corner--behind the grand piano, somewhere. All was still in this room where I had seen, for the first time, Sevrin, the anti-anarchist, captivated and spellbound by the consummate and hereditary grimaces that in a certain sphere of life take the place of feelings with an excellent effect. I suppose her thoughts were busy with the same memory. Her shoulders shook violently. A pure attack of nerves. When it quieted down she affected firmness, 'What is done to a man of that sort? What will they do to him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is perfect}} happiness," [...] said Dus to me, one lovely {{afternoon}} {{that we were}} strolling in company along the cliff, near the Nest--and {{a few minutes after}} she had <b>left</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>arms,</b> who had embraced and blessed her, as a pious parent does both to a well-beloved child--"This is perfect happiness, Mordaunt, to be the chosen of you, and the accepted of your parents! I never knew, until now, what it is to have a parent. Uncle Chainbearer did all he could for me, and I shall cherish his memory to my latest breath--but uncle Chainbearer could never supply the place of a mother. How blessed, how undeservedly blessed does my lot promise to become! You will give me not only parents, and parents I can love as well as if they were those granted by nature, but you will give me also two such sisters as few others possess!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Though {{he was a}} spin bowler, he had {{the fast}} run up of a <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> seamer. Unlike most other <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> spinners, he mostly bowled over the wicket. He was quicker than most spinners, and he {{surprised}} many batsman with his pace. He also had a good [...] "Chinaman" [...] (the wrong one of the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> spinner).|$|R

2500|$|...Marian Hossa, {{like the}} NHL 3 Modano was mass-produced with an error.

2500|$|Dalkowski's {{claim to}} fame was the high {{velocity}} of his fastball. Accurate measurements {{at the time were}} difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above 100 miles per hour. Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible <b>left</b> (pitching) <b>arm,</b> and by his unusual [...] "buggy-whip" [...] pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. [...] "I hit <b>my</b> <b>left</b> elbow on <b>my</b> right knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear", recalled Dalkowski.|$|R

40|$|Three new unusual {{compound}} chromosomes {{have been}} synthesized in Drosophila melanogaster.

The attachments of the autosomal arms were accomplished by obtaining chromosome breaks at or very close {{to the ends of the}} <b>left</b> <b>arms</b> of the autosomes such that no essential chromosome material has been removed; the compounds derived from them are therefore referred to as entire compounds. These large chromosomes are recovered in progeny with frequencies lower than expectation partly because of zygote mortality associated with these chromosomes, and partly because of a failure of spermiogenesis...|$|R

Tru-cut biopsy of the mass in the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> was consistent with MZL. The diagnosis was MALT lymphoma infiltrating the skeletal muscle (stage IIEA). R-CHOP was started. Two additional infusions of rituximab were administered after the sixth cycle of R-CHOP. Then, the patient received radiotherapy to the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> at a dose of 30  Gy. After 1  year of follow-up, the patient had no evidence of disease.|$|R
