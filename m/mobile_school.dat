40|$|The {{desire for}} any {{government}} that values {{the economic growth}} of its country is to provide education to its citizens. Kenya has made innumerable efforts towards this end since independence. However, several decades down the line, this {{is yet to be}} realised. The nomadic pastoralist community is one such a group that has remained out of school due to its palpetic lifestyle. Generally, formal education is appropriate for people leading a sedentary lifestyle, thereby making nomadic pastoralist community be persistently excluded from accessing formal education. Nevertheless, in efforts to promote access to education among communities that are mainly nomadic pastoralists, the Government of Kenya has established <b>mobile</b> <b>schools</b> in Turkana County. Several studies have been conducted on factors contributing to low participation of nomadic pastoralists in education, but very little research has been done on <b>mobile</b> <b>schools.</b> Using a mixed methods research design, various County Government documents and official documents found in schools were reviewed to obtain information concerning <b>Mobile</b> <b>schools</b> in the area of study. Purposive sampling was adopted for this study to identify schools and the population for study. Focused Group Discussions were also held for parents and the learners of the final grade in <b>mobile</b> <b>schools.</b> The quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics whereas thematic analysis approach was used for qualitative data. The findings were presented in verbatim and tables. This study found out that although <b>mobile</b> <b>schools</b> have promoted access to education among Turkana nomadic pastoralists, their level of participation in education is still significantly low. The study established that some of the conditions that enhance participation in education through <b>mobile</b> <b>schools</b> include: awareness and sensitization, community involvement and multi grade and multi shift approaches in education provision. Also importantly is adopting a multifaceted approach whereby there is both provision of education, food and security. This study recommends further research to establish ways of sustaining <b>mobile</b> <b>schools</b> in provision in provision of education among the nomadic pastoralists...|$|R

50|$|The Shree Chandrodaya Higher Secondary School was {{established}} in 1960 A.D. in Benighat VDC of Dhading District by the effort of local youth when The Education Department from Nuwakot District gave permission to operate a primary school and contributed NRs. 600 per annum. That NRs. 600 was {{the main source of}} school operation and in addition local people also used to contribute some money. At the time of its establishment, It was located in the Benighat Bazar. The Sanskrit, English, Mathematics and Nepali were the subjects of study. At the very beginning, the school didn't have a proper building and the learning activity was started in a shrine like house and there used to be merely 15-18 students. Even after a decade of its establishment, it has to wander here and there {{in order to get a}} proper land. It was like a <b>mobile</b> <b>school.</b> In 1965AD, the school was shifted from Benighat Bazar to Bishaltar, just above the current location of the school where the school has got its own premises. When the construction of Prithvi Highway started, the location was inaccessible for the students and people again started thinking to shift it nearby Prithvi Highway where the access is easy. In 1969, all the villagers came to a conclusion that the school should be shifted to the village of Bishaltar centering all the local dwellers where there is now the primary wing of Shree Chandrodaya Higher Secondary School. In 1977, It became a Lower Secondary School. In 1979, the Management Committee felt that the location was insufficient. So, they built a building and shifted the Lower Secondary School to the western part of the Bishaltar village called Baltar. The villagers from Benighat VDC, Dhusa VDC of Dhading District and Ghyalchok VDC of Gorkha District also contributed to make a building and other required infrastructures. Then slowly it became a Secondary School. As the infrastructure was not durable, its condition became miserable. At that time, an INGO Hanuman Onlus made first visit in the school and decided to help the school by building a new building. They buillt a 12-room cemented building along with toilet in association with another INGO C.O.Y.O.N. In 2009, the school became a Higher Secondary School. Today, this school has developed a lot. Chandrodaya Multiple Campus was also established where BBS and B.Ed are taught. Its one of the main attraction of the passengers passing by during their journey to Kathmandu. This school is one of the richest schools of Dhading District. Every single room is decorated with a white board, well painted desks and benches, fans, and lights. As of January 15, 2016, The 57th yearly anniversary of this school was celebrated in a great way with District Education Officer as the special guest. And from April 2016, This school even started to provide technical education to the secondary class students; a feat only achieved by few schools in Dhading district.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{schools were}} started {{to act as}} feeder schools for the regular primary schools to {{mitigate}} acute problem of under-enrolment in primary schools in ASAL districts. Ten years after introduction of mobile schools GER for Turkana County is 35 %. The problem of under enrolment still exists. The study was carried {{to find out the}} issues and challenges that hinder transition of pupils from mobile schools to regular primary schools in Turkana West district, Turkana County. The objectives of the study were to establish transition of rates of pupils, incentives offered to learners to encourage them to transit, perception of formal education by nomadic parents, effectiveness of <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> teachers and set backs on transition of learners from mobile schools to primary school. The researcher used descriptive survey study design. It was used because of the economy of design, rapid data collection and ability to understand populations from part of it. The population targeted was pupils of mobile schools (180) in three mobile schools, <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> teachers (24) in 12 schools, and head teachers of primary (41), parents (60) and education officers (2). The sample used was 38 pupils of mobile schools, 12 <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> teachers, 10 head teachers of primary schools, 20 parents and one education officer. The researcher used two methods to collect data; questionnaires designed for <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> teachers and head teachers of primary schools; semi-structured interviews designed for pupils of mobile schools, nomadic parents and area education officer. A part from mobile pupils who were randomly selected the other categories of sample were purposely selected. A total of 22 questionnaires were used and 59 interviews conducted. The data was analyzed manually. The findings were presented using descriptive statistics by use of frequencies, percentages in form of tables. The findings from the field indicate that transition of pupils from mobile schools to primary schools is very low, at 7 %. This has been contributed by distance of regular primary schools, lack of incentives; mode of dressing in regular primary schools is different from what learners in mobile schools are used to and few teachers. Data from primary schools further show that most of the learners are aged and feel out of place when sharing facilities with small boys and girls when they join primary schools. The researcher is recommending that these learners be provided the full primary education in their nomadic set up. If this happens many of them will complete primary education. Then provide them with the necessary teaching and learning facilities, equip them with enough teachers who are properly trained; appoint officers specifically to handle this type of schools. These schools should use non-formal curriculum which is flexible and relatively cheap given expected financial constraints. It is also suggested that further research is routinely conducted to explore nomadic friendly programmes before the implementation of any of these recommendations. Kenyatta Universit...|$|E

A 56 2009 Education {{is the major}} source of upward mobility especially in developing countries and a principal instrument in fostering democracy, equality and justice. Therefore equal and equitable educational opportunities are essential as an answer to socio-economic and political marginalization of different social groups in developing economies. In Kenya the government has particulated its commitment to offer free primary education to all its school going aged children. as evidenced by the introduction of Free Primary Education (F. P. E.) the government is also addressing the issue of the pastoralist communities by introducing mobile schools, these are schools designed to cater for the nomadic communities where the teachers shifts with the families as they search for pasture and water, though this is still in its initial stages and only in few districts, Wajir being one of them. Despite all this efforts the participation of girls from the nomadic communities is still very low. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out the effect of socio-cultural, sock, economic and school environment on the participation of' girls in the nomadic <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> programme in Wajir district. The study will sample mobile schools using purposive sampling techniques. The criterion used will be to sample the division with the most number of mobile schools and schools that are well established. The study used the descriptive survey design utilizing 11001 the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data will he collected using questionnaires for the head teachers, interview schedules for the teachers, parents, and D. EO, while the chiefs and village elders will participate in the study through focus group discussions. Data collected will be analyzed using frequencies and percentages because they easily communicate the research findings to the majority of the respondents. Frequencies easily show the number of' times a response occurs or the number of subjects in a given category. Percentages will be used to compare the sub-groups that differ in proportion and size. The data from the interview and focus group discussions will be carefully read and coded after editing the field notes. The coded responses will he analyzed deductively through SPSS computer program The major findings of the study were that the type of and distance to school were a major contributing factor to girls low enrolment in <b>mobile</b> <b>school</b> Girls are doing more domestic work also was a contributing factor.

Negative effects of pupil mobility have been found to relate to academic attainment (Dobson, Henthorne, & Lynas, 2000; Mott, 2002), but its effect on social and emotional development is less specific. A multi-stranded approach to intervention was used, which included the delivery of pilot curricular materials on emotional literacy to two classes in the school, an educational programme (Seasons for Growth) delivered to a smaller group of pupils {{and the development of a}} specific critical incident policy in the event of a casualty notification. Post-intervention, evaluation measures did not point to increases in pupils’ emotional literacy scores but the qualitative data indicated that the emotional literacy curriculum did receive positive ratings by pupils and staff.
