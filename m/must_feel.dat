25|$|Later Julieta collapses in {{the street}} but is seen by a newly-returned Lorenzo. He visits her flat where he finds a letter from Antía, which he brings to Julieta - along with her memoir, {{apparently}} unread. Antía speaks {{of the death of}} her son, which has deeply affected her and allowed her to understand how Julieta <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> at their separation. She has also included a return address. Lorenzo and Julieta drive to Switzerland and Julieta resolves not to demand an explanation, simply wishing to be with her daughter.|$|E

25|$|Safe solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, {{prepared}} and practised. They {{should have a}} completely redundant set of all life support equipment (e.g. a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply). In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others {{in the event of}} an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and nobody should ever think of doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so.|$|E
500|$|After George Armstrong Custer's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Little Bighorn, Sherman wrote that [...] "hostile savages like Sitting Bull {{and his band}} of outlaw Sioux ... <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> the {{superior}} power of the Government." [...] He further wrote that [...] "during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age." [...] Despite his harsh treatment of the warring tribes, Sherman spoke out against the unfair way speculators and government agents treated the natives within the reservations.|$|E
500|$|Antoinist healers {{are always}} dressed members, {{and are not}} paid. They do not attend {{specific}} training or receive any initiation rite. Those who want to access this function <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> spiritually [...] "inspired" [...] and obtain the desservant's approval. They must also promise to respect Antoinist rules including nondisclosure of confessions by consultants and not discouraging traditional medicine. Before receiving consultants, no kind of asceticism is required, but mental preparation includes prayer and meditation. Regarded as mere intercessors, healers have a [...] "charisma of function" [...] as they reproduce that of Antoine, which does not prevent some healers from becoming very popular among consultants.|$|E

500|$|On 5 September 1945, {{just as the}} war had ended, Harrison died {{suddenly}} of hypertensive cerebrovascular disease {{at his home in}} the Melbourne suburb of Brighton; he was survived by his wife and daughter, and cremated. The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, commented that [...] "all members of the service, and, indeed, all Australians interested in aviation, <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> his loss as the snapping of one of the last links with the pioneer days of flying". One of the original Deperdussins that Harrison ordered and helped assemble for the Central Flying School in 1914 later went on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.|$|E

Nicole Paitsel, Lisa Deaderick, and Joe Atkinson from Daily Press each rated the roller coaster for its vomiting and scream factors. Nicole and Lisa rated the vomiting factor a one (out of five) for the roller coaster's smoothness; Joe gave a four as he began feeling ill after his second ride. For the scream factor Nicole gave a five, Lisa gave a ten, and Joe gave a four. Mike from NewsPlusNotes praised the first drop for its freefall experience.|$|E
500|$|Kimball's {{first years}} as an apostle were {{dominated}} by World War II. Kimball often encouraged American church members to purchase war bonds to support the war effort, which they would {{then be able to}} cash out after the war and use the accumulated interest to send the returned soldiers on their LDS missions. Kimball lamented the global destruction of World War II and once wrote in his journal, [...] "How outraged the Lord <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> to see His children fighting down here like wild beasts." [...] As the keynote speaker at BYU's 1944 baccalaureate service, Kimball publicly criticized members of Allied nations for concentrating on [...] "the tyranny and shackles of [...] nations {{and at the same time}} [...] in bondage individually to sin." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin {{influenced}} {{several of}} her songs. [...] While showering one day during rehearsals, {{she came up with}} the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. [...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers gazed down at her, [...] "That's exactly what I want. [...] Never do it differently. [...] We <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> you couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Nat Hentoff (The Reporter) {{struggled}} {{to disagree with}} Goodman's claim that schools provided little room for [...] "spontaneity" [...] and free spiritedness. However, he felt that Goodman inadequately explained how primary schools could be improved in content and staffing. Hentoff said that the book's key flaw was its position in a [...] "political vacuum", offering no means for society to acknowledge Goodman's expressed unviability of their schooling model. Donald Barr (New York Herald Tribune Book Week) wrote that Goodman seemed like [...] "an itinerant peddler of sedition" [...] who spoke of virtuous [...] "dissonance". Barr considered Goodman [...] "extraordinarily sensitive to children and adolescents" [...] and complimented his [...] "brilliant authenticity" [...] when describing how children learn [...] "defiance and embarrassment". However, Barr found Goodman's [...] "purblind resentment of all authority" [...] to obstruct his points and to leave his readers skeptical. Children, Barr wrote, are lost if they cannot find the limits they serve to test, and [...] "partisan" [...] Goodman was unable to parse the wickedness of continually [...] "yielding, ... tolerating, understanding" [...] children who <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> resistance against their transgressions to develop the respect they seek.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} several songs relate to Duff's {{experiences}} between the releases of Hilary Duff and Dignity. The songs [...] "Stranger" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Woman", despite speculation {{that they were}} written about Madden's then-new girlfriend Nicole Richie, were actually written about Duff's father's affair. She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it seem like {{it was about a}} relationship I was in, because I didn't want people to know about my parents. But I've realized that so many people can relate to what I've gone through." [...] The album's title track has also been reported to be about Richie, though Duff did not deny rumors that it was. [...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely about people in Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E

500|$|The American {{military}} establishment strongly backed Diệm. Colonel Edward Lansdale, a CIA agent who helped entrench Diệm {{in power in}} 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the Eisenhower administration to recall the ambassador. Lansdale said that [...] "It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diệm <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow's remarks over the months helped incite the revolt." [...] Lansdale criticised Durbrow: [...] "At the most critical moment of the coup, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diệm {{to give in to}} rebel demands to avoid bloodshed." [...] Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the new commander of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, agreed with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the [...] "courageous action of Diệm coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon". McGarr asserted that [...] "Diệm has emerged from this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population." [...] General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said that [...] "When you have rebellious forces against you, you have to act forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can't be avoided and that those in power must act decisively." [...] The State Department advised President Dwight David Eisenhower to send Diệm a congratulatory message, but Durbrow objected, arguing that Diệm would interpret the message as an unqualified endorsement of his rule and prevent him from [...] "grasping and heeding lessons of [...] coup".|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Tessa {{demonstrates}} great courage, {{for example}} in [...] "", where she is abducted by three mountain men led by Immortal Caleb Cole, who wants to marry her. Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him." [...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved." [...] Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In [...] "", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, [...] "I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [...] could happen to you." [...] Tessa has no self-pity and [...] "...doesn't like euphemisms". For example, in [...] "For Tomorrow We Die", MacLeod calls her [...] "contrary by nature" [...] Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on {{the windows of the}} home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, [...] "This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to grapple with the terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: [...] "It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output." [...] The review found the acting to be good, but found fault {{in the shadows of the}} actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: [...] "The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar Room will not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment." [...] Bowers states that the paper [...] "was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason to mention it now." ...|$|E

He remarked, [...] "How happy, Sir, you <b>must</b> <b>feel,</b> to be thus peaceably employed in adorning your mansion, whilst all the country round {{is in such}} commotion." [...] Kilravock was a firm supporter {{of the house of}} Hanover, but his adherence was not solicited, nor were his preferences alluded to. The next day, the Duke of Cumberland called at the castle gate, and when Kilravock went to receive him, he bluffly observed, [...] "So you had my cousin Charles here yesterday."

2500|$|The {{book was}} a minor success when {{published}} in 1935, retelling the true-life affair of four French soldiers who were executed {{to set an example}} {{to the rest of the}} troops. The novel was adapted to the stage the same year by World War I veteran Sidney Howard. The play was a flop on Broadway because of its harsh anti-war scenes that alienated the audience. Nonetheless, Howard continued to believe in the relevance of the subject matter and thought it should be made into a film, writing, [...] "It seems to me that our motion picture industry <b>must</b> <b>feel</b> something of a sacred obligation to make the picture." [...] Fulfilling Howard's [...] "sacred obligation", Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt it to the screen after he remembered reading the book when he was younger. Kubrick and his partners purchased the film rights from Cobb's widow for $10,000.|$|E

DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received {{from the rest of the}} hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, [...] "This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with." [...] As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, [...] "It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that.
