5|$|Annie Hall {{won four}} Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards on April 3, 1978, and was {{nominated}} for five in total. Producer Charles H. Joffe received the statue for Best Picture, Allen for Best Director and, with Brickman, for Best Original Screenplay, and Keaton for Best Actress. Allen was also nominated for Best Actor. <b>Many</b> <b>had</b> expected Star Wars to win the major awards, including Brickman and Executive Producer Robert Greenhut.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these attacks}} and {{those from the}} extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, <b>many</b> <b>had</b> thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, local {{politics}} split over slavery as <b>many</b> <b>had</b> ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, {{the number of}} military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived postwar, waves of immigrants and land annexations brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.|$|E
5|$|In either usage, most B movies {{represent}} a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more {{popular in the}} 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, <b>many</b> <b>had</b> running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.|$|E

5|$|In {{many other}} neighborhoods, the City had renewed and thus gentrified areas without public hearings, because {{residents}} of those neighborhoods were low-income renters. In Milwaukee Avenue's case, however, the residents were of medium income, and seasoned protesters, since <b>many</b> <b>had</b> protested the Vietnam War. By 1970, the City of Minneapolis planned to raze the Milwaukee Avenue houses using {{funds from the}} Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, nearly 56,000 Jews {{were living}} in Belgium out of a {{population}} of roughly 8 million. <b>Many</b> <b>had</b> fled to Belgium to escape recent persecution in Germany and elsewhere, meaning that only a minority were Belgian citizens. Most of the Jewish population was focused in communities in the towns of Brussels and Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Motte-and-bailey castles {{became a}} less popular {{design in the}} mid-medieval period. In France, they were not built {{after the start of}} the 12th century, and mottes ceased to be built in most of England after around 1170, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches. Many motte-and-bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly; in England <b>many</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by the 12th century. In the Low Countries and Germany, a similar transition occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as <b>many</b> <b>had</b> expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
5|$|Operation Agatha {{started at}} 04:15 on 29 June. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was {{responsible}} for Tel Aviv, the 1st Parachute Brigade for Jewish settlements around Ma'abarot and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for those around Givat Brenner. The operation ended on 1July after 2,718 suspects had been arrested. <b>Many</b> <b>had</b> no connection to the resistance movements and were instead arrested for harassing the searchers or for refusing to give their names when asked. The 6th Airborne Division alone arrested 636 persons, 135 of them for being suspected Palmach members and ten were Jewish leaders.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where <b>many</b> <b>had</b> entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans to be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E

5|$|The crowd {{traveled}} {{the distance from}} Paris to Versailles in about six hours. Among their makeshift weaponry they dragged along several cannons taken from the Hôtel de Ville. Boisterous and energetic, they recruited (or impressed into service) more and more followers as they surged out of Paris in the autumn rain. In their ambiguous but always aggressive poissard slang, they chattered enthusiastically about bringing the king back home. Less affectionately, they spoke of the queen, Marie Antoinette, and <b>many</b> <b>had</b> no restraint in calling for her death.|$|E
5|$|The film {{created a}} greater {{awareness}} of the franchise and drew in many new fans. Transformers box office success led to the active development of films based on Voltron and Robotech, {{as well as a}} Knight Rider remake. When filming the sequel, Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like, and that <b>many</b> <b>had</b> christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles.

5|$|This was but {{one point}} of {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest of}} Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and <b>many</b> <b>had</b> college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools with fine teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly twice as much as Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked.

5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. <b>Many</b> <b>had</b> gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives.
