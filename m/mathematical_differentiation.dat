Patterns included staircase stimulations, constant prolonged single steps, restimulations, and ramp functions. Except at low concentrations, prolonged single steps of glucose elicited early spikes of insulin and a slowly rising second phase. Total insulin in the initial spikes increased with higher glucose concentrations. However, the time-related pattern of these spikes was similar in all cases; ratios of initial secretion rate to total insulin released were constant. Total insulin released in this early phase approximated a sigmoidal function of glucose concentration; <b>mathematical</b> <b>differentiation</b> of this function gave a skewed bell-shaped distribution curve. Staircase stimulations caused insulin to be released {{as a series of}} transient spikes which did not correlate with the increment of glucose but rather to the available insulin for a given glucose concentration minus that released in previous steps. The sum of total insulin released as spikes in a staircase series leading to a given glucose concentration was the same as when that concentration was used as a single step. Interrupted prolonged glucose infusions indicated the second phase of insulin release could prime the pancreas and that the first and second phases were interrelated.

40|$|Aims Criteria of {{identification}} of individual heart cycle phases {{according to an}} ECG curve are described in this paper. Materials and methods For this study, a single-lead system ECG is used only. Its distinctive feature is that an ECG signal is recorded within the body surface area of the ascending aorta. Using the theory of biological system process continuity, the individual heart cycle phase boundaries are determined at those points of the cardiac signals where we deal with an energy process transition in the cardiovascular system from {{the process of the}} energy build-up to its attenuation, and vice versa. The transition points are identified by us by <b>mathematical</b> <b>differentiation</b> of the ECG signals, and, as a result, they correspond to extrema of the ECG derivative. Some individual heart cycle phases are found according to maxima on the derivative, others are identified according to minima on the derivative curve, respectively. Results The method of application of the ECG derivatives allows to capture individual heart cycle phases in a very precise manner. Utilization of the ECG derivatives is a prerequisite for computer-assisted processing of the data to deliver measurements of durations of every heart cycle phase. Conclusion Using the ECG derivatives for fixing every heart cycle phase makes possible to fill up the gaps in the theory of phase analysis and avoid misinterpretations of any type of the ECG phase structures. ...|$|E
40|$|A damage {{characterization}} framework {{based on}} the "pseudo-excitation" (PE) approach has recently been established, aimed at quantitatively identifying damage in beam-, plate-, and shell-like structural components. However, it is envisaged that {{the effectiveness of the}} PE approach can be restricted in practical implementation, due to the involvement of high order derivatives of structural dynamic deflections, in which measurement noise and uncertainties can overwhelm the damage associated signal features upon <b>mathematical</b> <b>differentiation.</b> In this study, the PE approach was revamped by introducing the weighted integration, whereby the prerequisite of satisfying the local equilibrium conditions was relaxed from "point-by-point" to "region-by-region". The revamped modality was thus colloquially referred to as "weak formulation" of the PE approach, as opposed to its original version which is contrastively termed as "strong formulation". By properly configuring a weight function, noise immunity of the PE approach was enhanced, giving rise to improved detection accuracy and precision even under noisy measurement conditions. Furthermore, the 'weak formulation' was extended to a series of coherent variants through partial integration, rendering a multitude of detection strategies by selecting measurement parameters and configurations. This endowed the PE approach with flexibility in experimental manipulability, so as to accommodate various detection requirements. As an application of the "weak formulation", a continuous gauss smoothing (CGS) -based detection scheme was developed, and validated by localizing multiple cracks in a beam structure, showing fairly improved noise tolerance.

40|$|Automatic {{detection}} of the pavement damages due to various actions of frost and vehicles {{would be helpful}} {{for the management of}} the distresses and for proper conditioning of the road. The aim of the automatic distress condition detection is to save time and resources. To fulfill this aim, development of the detection technique using various interpolation algorithms, <b>mathematical</b> <b>differentiation</b> and image interpretation technique is used as the main tool in this study. The raw data from the laser scanning machine mounted on the vehicle is the basis {{for the development of the}} methodology. Using the interpolation functions in the MATLAB platform, visual {{detection of}} the cracks is done. The kriging algorithm, delaunay triangulation principle and interpolation techniques and three dimensional plotting were tried and found the best algorithm suitable for the study with regards to the their accuracy of the result towards the reality (based on ocular inspection of the sections interpolated). The interpolated image thus generated were further processed using the differentiation technique which on further filtering and brushing, cracks were sorted out from the non-cracks pixels in the binary image. The cracks pixels and non-cracks pixels were sorted out by image analysis techniques in MATLAB. This analysis generated the image that showed cracks separated from non-crack pixels. By counting of the numbers of the adjacent crack pixels classification of the status of road section was automatically performed. In this study a scale of three classes of presence of cracks was used for classification of the pavement section. The methodology developed in this study however have some limitations related to the classification of the crack classes as potholes, first class, second class and third class. These limitations are basically the length, width and area of cracks. Even, with these limitations, it must be noted that the method developed is promising for the development of automatic distress detection of the pavement. Further enhancement of the method using advance machine and algorithm might be the way ahead of this study. This obviously will help a lot in the real field works if this study could be implemented with some enhancement for the automatic detection and classification of road distress condition.

40|$|Expanding product {{variety and}} high {{customer}} service provision are both major challenges for manufacturers {{to compete in}} the global market. In addition to many ongoing programs, such as lead-time reduction, redesigning products and processes so as to delay the point of product differentiation is becoming an emerging means to address these challenges. Such a strategy calls for redesigning products and processes so that the stages of the production process in which a common process is used are prolonged. This product/process redesign will defer the point of differentiation (i. e., defer the stage after which the products assume their unique identities). In this paper, we develop a simple model that captures the costs and benefits associated with this redesign strategy. We apply this simple model to analyze some special cases that are motivated by real examples. These special cases enable us to formalize three different product/process redesign approaches (standardization, modular design, and process restructuring) for delaying product differentiation that some companies are beginning to pursue. Finally, we analyze some special theoretical cases that enable us to characterize the optimal point of product differentiation and derive managerial insights. product/process redesign, product <b>differentiation,</b> <b>mathematical</b> models...|$|R

Motion capture localization with cm-scale accuracy or better is typically performed optically, with limited range, high setup time, and environmental limitations (e. g. infrared systems {{that do not}} work outdoors). Today's true RF-based motion capture technology involves sensing low-frequency or DC fields using bulky sensor boxes [...] with ranges {{of only a few}} meters.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} {{consists}} of developing a new (more physical and numerical in comparison with standard and non-standard analysis approaches) {{point of view on}} Calculus with functions assuming infinite and infinitesimal values. It uses recently introduced infinite and infinitesimal numbers being in accordance with the principle 'The part is less than the whole' observed in the physical world around us. These numbers have a strong practical advantage with respect to traditional approaches: they are representable at a new kind of a computer - the Infinity Computer - able to work numerically with all of them. An introduction to the theory of physical and <b>mathematical</b> continuity and <b>differentiation</b> (including subdifferentials) for functions assuming finite, infinite, and infinitesimal values over finite, infinite, and infinitesimal domains is developed in the paper. This theory allows one to work with derivatives that can assume not only finite but infinite and infinitesimal values, as well.

To illustrate these conditions, a summary of essential theory is followed by examples, using full-range Fourier series and also half-range Fourier series. In these examples of stress solutions it is found that the assigned boundary trac-tions provide equations sufficient to determine the Fourier coefficients. Additional mathematical conditions, however, are imposed by the hypothesis of termwise differentiation. Unless it can be proved that these additional conditions are fulfilled, the conclusion is that the hypothetical representation by Fourier series may not have sufficient generality to satisfy all required conditions and furnish a solution.
