40|$|A {{controllable}} IC-compatible thin-film fuse {{was developed}} that had Al/SiO 2 thin-film stacks on a silicon substrate. The <b>micro</b> <b>fuse</b> has both a traditional mode and a controllable mode when applied as a fuse. It blows at 800 mA and 913. 8 mV {{in the traditional}} mode. In the controllable mode, it blows within 400 ns at 10 V. It {{can be used for}} small electronic elements as well as electropyrotechnic initiators to improve the no-firing current...|$|E

From CAD data of digital 3 D objects the trajectories of the laser focus are automatically generated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel process chain for fabrication of replication masters for micro injection molding, hot embossing and roll to roll imprinting. The advantages {{and limitations of}} the component technologies in the proposed process chain are analyzed and their sequence in a process chain for producing both 2. 5 D and 3 D nano- and micro- structures is justified. In order to fabricate Ni shims incorporating different length scale features, the proposed master-making route relies on using different technologies for micro structuring and sub-micron and nano patterning in their optimal processing windows. In particular, the capabilities of photolithography as a micro structuring technology are combined with those of FIB machining to add sub-micron and nano features on <b>micro</b> patterned <b>fused</b> silica templates. Then, by applying UV nano imprinting such templates were validated and the nano and micro structures were consistently replicated in one step. Finally, the transfer of such imprints into Ni shims was also successfully accomplished with only 10 % deviations from the target dimensions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDigital {{photonic}} {{production of}} 3 D microfluidic devices and assembled <b>micro</b> mechanics inside <b>fused</b> silica glass {{is carried out}} using ISLE directly from digital CAD data. To exploit the potential productivity of new high average power fs-lasers > 150 W a modular high speed scanning system has been developed. Acousto-optical beam deflection, galvo-scanners and translation stages are controlled by CAM software. Using a lens with 10 mm focal length a focus radius of 1 μm is scanned with a velocity of 12 m/s on 400 μm track radius enabling the up-scaling of the ISLE- process using fs-laser radiation with up to 30 W...|$|R
40|$|<b>Micro</b> lipid {{droplets}} <b>fuse</b> {{with each}} other in vivo to form larger precursors of milk lipid globules. The extent of fusion dictates the size range of lipid globules in milk. A cell-free system in which micro lipid droplet fusion can be induced has been developed. Fusion was promoted by calcium and a protein complex from cytosol. Exogenously supplied gangliosides were potent fusion-promoting agents. Endogenous gangliosides were detected on micro lipid droplet surfaces by immunocytochemical localization. Monoclonal antibody to disialyllactosylceramide (GD 3) inhibited micro lipid droplet fusion. These observations are suggestive of a role for gangliosides in micro lipid droplet fusion in situ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, micro fluid {{channels}} are machined on fused silica glass via powder blasting, a mechanical etching process, and the machining {{characteristics of the}} {{channels are}} experimentally evaluated. In the process, material removal is performed by the collision of micro abrasives injected by highly compressed air on to the target surface. This approach {{can be characterized as}} an integration of brittle mode machining based on <b>micro</b> crack propagation. <b>Fused</b> silica glass, a high purity synthetic amorphous silicon dioxide, is selected as a workpiece material. It has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent optical qualities and exceptional transmittance over a wide spectral range, especially in the ultraviolet range. The powder blasting process parameters affecting the machined results are injection pressure, abrasive particle size and density, stand-off distance, number of nozzle scanning, and shape/size of the required patterns. In this study, the influence of the number of nozzle scanning, abrasive particle size, and pattern size on the formation of micro channels is investigated. Machined shapes and surface roughness are measured using a 3 -dimensional vision profiler and the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} is to address certain contemporary performative practices, more specifically the land foundation in Thailand and Sørfinnset School / the north land in Norway, and the tensions these reveal {{in relation to}} contemporary culture and theory. During {{the last years of}} the 20 th and first years of the 21 st century, several performance and art-related practices displayed a specific thematic structure related to the sense of belonging and movement, to the tensions between mobility and stability or home – several also had names which included these latter terms. They were part of a larger tendency in art and culture that investigated the social spaces and means available in late modernity through, for example, the communicational aspects of art and media, and the conditions for coexistence created in temporary rooms. While dealing with problematic issues of situatedness and de-situatedness, locality and globality, the practices also seemed to establish something else: A very elaborate and concrete “here and now”, a kind of social immediacy that both complemented and supplemented the art context. Further, these art and performance practices seemed to parallel certain vital theoretical and societal discussions {{at the end of the}} 20 th century; art theoretical, performance theoretical, phenomenological and post-structuralist. In this thesis Christensen-Scheel analyzes a material consisting of two ongoing, long-term socio-cultural projects organized as art or culture centres, the land foundation in Thailand and Sørfinnset School / the north land in Norway, and sees them in relation to a central existential tension between the situated and the de-situated as well as different art and performance theoretical concepts. The mobile home is used as an illustrating concept to grasp mobility and situatedness simultaneously, and the above mentioned theoretical bodies are combined to provide the basis for a broad aesthetical approach that include a vaster part of our sensuous surroundings as well as certain social dynamics. Finally, the concept of ecology is used as a tool to co-think seeming oppositions, and in order to <b>fuse</b> <b>micro</b> and macro levels in existential as well as aesthetical processes...|$|R
