As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continu-ously fuzzes the configuration and checks “security invariants” that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability; however, the fuzzing is performed in a duplicated copy of the original process, so that it does not affect the state of the running application.

Users must {{explicitly}} encrypt and sign message contents using tools like PGP {{if they wish to}} protect themselves against message tampering, forgery, or eavesdropping. However, few do, leaving the vast majority of users left open to such attacks. Fortunately, some degree of protection against network-based eavesdropping attacks is provided by transport-layer security, an option supported by all major mail transfer protocols (SMTP, IMAP, and POP 3), and against tampering and forgery by DKIM and SPF. In this thesis we evaluate the security provided by these protocols, both in theory and in practice. Using a combination set of measurement techniques, we determine whether each provider supports TLS at each point in their email message path, and whether the provider support SPF and DKIM on incoming and outgoing mail. We found that while {{more than half of the}} top 20, 000 receiving MTAs supported TLS, and support for TLS is increasing, servers do not check certificates, opening the Internet email system up to man-in-the-middle eavesdropping attacks. Use of SPF is common, however enforcement is limited. Few of the senders we examined used DKIM, and fewer still rejected invalid DKIM signatures. Today's global email system thus provides some protection against passive eavesdropping, limited protection against unprivileged peer message forgery, and no protection against active network-based attacks. We observe that protection even against the latter is possible using existing protocols with proper enforcemen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for protein redesign is the efficient evaluation of a combinatorial number of candidate structures. The modeling of protein flexibility, typically by using a rotamer library of commonly-observed low-energy side-chain conformations, further increases {{the complexity of the}} redesign problem. A dominant algorithm for protein redesign is dead-end elimination (DEE), which prunes the majority of candidate conformations by eliminating rigid rotamers that provably {{are not part of the}} global minimum energy conformation (GMEC). The identified GMEC consists of rigid rotamers (i. e., rotamers that have not been energy-minimized) and is thus referred to as the rigid-GMEC. As a postprocessing step, the conformations that survive DEE may be energy-minimized. When energy minimization is performed after pruning with DEE, the combined protein design process becomes heuristic, and is no longer provably accurate: a conformation that is pruned using rigid-rotamer energies may subsequently minimize to a lower energy than the rigid-GMEC. That is, the rigid-GMEC and the conformation with the lowest energy among all energy-minimized conformations (the minimized-GMEC) are likely to be different. While the traditional DEE algorithm succeeds in not pruning rotamers that are part of the rigid-GMEC, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> regarding the identification of the minimized-GMEC. In this paper we derive a novel, provable, and efficient DEE-like algorithm, called minimized-DEE (MinDEE), that guarantees that rotamers belonging to the minimized-GMEC will not be pruned, while still pruning a combinatorial number of conformations. We show that MinDEE is useful not only in identifying the minimized-GMEC, but also as a filte...|$|E

However, the slack time scheduler <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> to a task beyond its processor capacity reserve, i. e., the scheduler cannot guarantee that a soft real-time task will receive a higher quality of service than is specified by its resource reservation. Nevertheless users often assume that a desired quality of service (QoS) can be achieved using an optimistic resource reservation. Even though existing slack time schedulers perform well in a closed real-time system (with well-behaved applications, station-ary workloads, or excessive processor speed), their performance can drop significantly when a task changes its workload.

When {{there are more than}} f failures, traditional BFT protocols <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> whatsoever.

We present BFT 2 F, an extension to the well-known Castro-Liskov PBFT algorithm [6], to explore the design space beyond f failures. Specifically, BFT 2 F has the same liveness and consistency guarantees as PBFT when no more than f replicas fail; with more than f but no more than 2 f failures, BFT 2 F prohibits malicious servers from making up operations that clients have never issued and restricts malicious servers to only certain kinds of consistency violations. Evaluations of a prototype implementation show that the additional guarantees of BFT 2 F come at the cost of only a slight performance degradation compared to PBFT. ...|$|R
