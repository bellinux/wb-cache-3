Results show that employer-driven obligation to stop working (owing to business closure, redundancy, dismissal, early retirement, etc.), marital status (married/widowed) and health status are the main reasons for the premature cessation of activity common to all four countries studied (Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), while the desire to retire from the labour market or live off private wealth (voluntary cessation) has a significant effect only for Belgium and the Netherlands. However, the impact of this reason on the retirement age is much lower than that of departure enforced by the employer (2 to 3 times lower in these two countries) ...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{on early}} {{retirement}} has generally ignored firms' {{role in the}} labour <b>market</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> Yet, {{as it is shown}} in this paper, employee incentives alone cannot explain the increase in unemployment {{at the end of the}} career. Instead, we construct an implicit contracts model where we account for both the firm and the worker incentives. Displacements occur only when joint utility of the two parties are greater for displacement than for continued employment. We use a firm-worker -panel to test two implications of our model. First, we find that firms target their layoffs on employees who lose least when displaced. This targeting is more frequent in firms in financial distress and during a recession. Second, we find that a change in a disability risk affects also the displacement probability. This is due to differences in experience rating for the disability and unemployment pensions.

Three changes to the food safety code are proposed to address three of the top causes for an allergen-related recall in the United States. In practice, the SQF code should make better use of control theory to reduce delays in production monitoring activities, should make better use of purposeful action in the implementation of a HACCP plan to ensure continuing validity of the plan, and SQFI needs to consider adding an organizational assessment for food safety culture...|$|R

40|$|Modern firms assume {{strategic}} both {{in thinking}} and in action {{to the extent}} that they manage change to their own advantage. The market evolutionary trends, especially non-incremental ones that relate to new primary demand, new technology, channel changes, market redefinition and new government policies dealt with in this article often question the adaptability of incumbent firms, transform the mode of competition, and usher in new entrants, who may wish to take advantage of the incumbents’ leapfrogs. This article suggests that investment decisions be timed to reflect the moment when the match between a firm’s capabilities and the key market requirements is at optimum or when the strategic window is open. <b>Market</b> <b>withdrawals</b> are often contemplated when the market no longer proves profitable for a firm or when the window is shut behind a firm.

The criticism from health care pro-viders [2, 3] {{as well as from}} pre-coverage health tech-nology assessors (HTA) and payers [4 - 6], but also from patient groups [5] is nurtured by the fact that unsafe devices reach the European markets with pre-mature cli-nical data. Re-regulation details are still under debate: It has been suggested {{to reduce the number of}} European market authorisation agencies (“Notified Bodies/NB”) from the current 75 to a few certified ones to approve highly specialised devices or to even go for complete cen-tralisation, as is the case with drugs.

40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{debate on the}} {{advantages}} of quasi-markets for placement services compared to their public deliverance. During 2009, the German Public Employment Service (PES) implemented a randomized field experiment to investigate if intensive services for hard-to-place unemployed individuals can be provided more effectively by such private providers or by PES in-house teams. Unemployed persons were assigned to intensive services {{for a period of}} eight months. This paper presents the first results of this experiment; the observation period covers 18 months after assignment. Initial in-house provision reduces accumulated days in unemployment by one to two months. Approximately two thirds of this effect is attributable to labor <b>market</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> The effect on the share of individuals in a given labor market status (unemployed, employed, and withdrawn) occurs mainly during the program period of eight months and disappears {{by the end of the}} observation period. We conclude that in a particular environment, the public provision of placement services can be as least as effective as contracting-out - a simple comparison of effectiveness might, however, be misleading...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{decision-making}} process of international <b>market</b> <b>withdrawal</b> {{within the scope of}} international market portfolio management. A comparative study of eight withdrawal cases in four multinational firms results in a six-phased decision-making model that is driven by threat-rigidity behavior, failure-induced learning and political dynamics. Two types of international <b>market</b> <b>withdrawal</b> are identified. On the one hand, a tactical withdrawal is the outcome of threat-rigidity and exploitative learning at the level of executive management. A strategic withdrawal, on the other hand, is characterized by a process of failure-induced exploratory learning initiated by middle level challengers. In contrast to a tactical withdrawal, which remains an isolated decision and does not interfere with other international ventures of the business unit, a strategic withdrawal {{turns out to be a}} germ of strategic (re) orientation of the business unit’s entire international market portfolio. Whether a <b>market</b> <b>withdrawal</b> turns out to be tactical or strategic ultimately depends on the autonomy, the amount and the relevance of challengers’ market and business knowledge.
