50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{describe the}} WNC as the closest South Africa {{has come to}} having a strong women’s movement. However, they note that the WNC was not backed up by a strong, locally rooted, mass movement of women. Its affiliates tended to be women’s organizations with long histories, but with weak organizational capacities and resources. The coalition did not use a mass mobilization strategy to back up its demands, rather, it relied on access to political parties as its <b>main</b> <b>lever</b> of influence. At the same time, {{the demands of the}} constitutional negotiations required the coalition to utilize the technical expertise of feminist academics and lawyers in ways that previous women’s movements had not managed.|$|E
50|$|Their {{construction}} was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode {{on a single}} double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on {{the rear of the}} plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand brake. Pulling upwards on this applied an iron brake to the tread of the wheel. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the cast wheel was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The brake linkage comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the <b>main</b> <b>lever.</b> It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.|$|E
5000|$|The Mirage also debuted Mitsubishi's Super Shift transmission, a four-speed manual with {{a second}} lever for [...] "low" [...] and [...] "high" [...] range; thus, {{effectively}} making the transmission an eight-speed unit. The Super Shift was not originally planned. However, Mitsubishi engineers had {{to make use of}} the existing Orion engine designed for rear-wheel drive applications making use of the longitudinal engine orientation. In the Mirage, sizing constraints as a result of the front-wheel drive layout required the engine to be mounted transversely, thus causing the carburetor to face forwards and run into icing issues. However, the primary implication of the Mirage's powertrain orientation—and the issue that demanded the unconventional transmission—was the mounting of the transmission beneath the engine. This required the gearbox to take power down from the clutch, an action not possible directly as this would have dictated that the gearbox rotate in the opposite direction to that required. To overcome this, the use of an extra [...] "idle" [...] transfer shaft was necessitated. It was subsequently realized that for a cost no more than developing a new five-speed transmission, this shaft could be modified as a separate two-speed gearbox controlled by a secondary shift lever mounted alongside the <b>main</b> <b>lever</b> inside the cabin. The ratios on this transfer transmission were, in effect, [...] "underdrives"—consequently marked on the second shift lever as a [...] "power" [...] mode due to increased performance granted by the lower gearing. In contrast, the higher overdrive setting was noted as [...] "economy". Mitsubishi called this a unique selling proposition.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of freight transport performance should {{be related to}} the industrial production system in which the transport service takes place. In the management literature, logistic performance is more and more often measured in terms of customer satisfaction [32, 34]—not simply {{from the point of view}} of the shipper, but with regard to the global supply chain. Freight transport performance indicators should encompass the global efficiency of flows of goods and information inside a production system. In such a framework, the <b>main</b> <b>levers</b> to improve performance are the qualitative and quantitative adaptation to production systems instead of mere cost reduction and investments in vehicle technology or infrastructures.|$|R
40|$|Rats' {{responses}} were reinforced on concurrent variable-ratio variable-ratio schedules in which responses on one lever incremented the ratio counter and responses {{on a second}} lever changed the schedule and correlated stimulus. The relative frequency of reinforcement was varied from. 10 to. 99. In one set of conditions, responding on the <b>main</b> <b>lever</b> incremented both ratio counters, but reinforcement required a response {{in the presence of}} the stimulus correlated with the ratio that had been completed. In a second set of conditions, responses on the <b>main</b> <b>lever</b> incremented only the ratio correlated with the stimulus that was currently present. When main-lever responses incremented both ratio counters, subjects distributed responding and time in a manner consistent with the generalized matching law. When responses on the <b>main</b> <b>lever</b> incremented only the schedule currently in effect, the rats responded almost exclusively on the schedule producing the higher frequency of reinforcement.

To reach a long-term change in the fashion industry, the consumer has to be the focus of the sustainable efforts.

30|$|Two <b>main</b> <b>levers</b> {{can make}} (formal) work pay for low-productivity {{workers and their}} employers: {{decreasing}} the labor tax wedge at lower wage levels and “smoothing” incentives with changes to social assistance, housing, and family benefits. Regarding the tax wedge, current social protection financing in several countries discriminates against lower earners. Options for reducing the labor tax wedge include incentives linked to wage subsidies, social insurance contribution credits, or so-called “in-work” or employment-conditional benefits—cash benefits or refundable income tax credits conditional on formal employment—for low-wage earners. With regard {{to the design of}} social assistance, housing, and family benefits, the key is to keep the marginal effective tax rate in mind when designing eligibility conditions and how benefits are withdrawn. The goal is to reform these benefits toward so-called “smart safety nets,” making social protection benefits more compatible with work. In particular, any additional wage should also increase beneficiaries’ net incomes, including benefits. Otherwise, additional work does not pay, and beneficiaries will prefer to not work at all, to work informally, or to underreport their earnings 3.|$|R
