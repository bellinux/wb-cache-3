5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1983, <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was {{formally}} lifted, though many heightened controls on {{civil liberties and}} political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in supporting the Polish labor-movement. The trade union Solidarity (Solidarność) began in 1980. The Soviet-backed Communist regime headed by General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in December1981.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. <b>Martial</b> <b>law</b> was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British {{camp was}} {{targeted}} for {{attack by the}} Irgun on two occasions. On 27 June 1939, the paramilitary group placed a letter bomb in the mailbox attached to the outside wall; the subsequent explosion collapsed part of the wall and injured five Arabs in the vicinity. On 12 March 1947, the Irgun penetrated the camp itself in a pre-dawn operation and detonated explosives {{in one of the}} buildings to protest the imposition of <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> on Jerusalem. One British soldier was killed and eight injured in the blasts; <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was lifted four days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|The saloon keepers, who {{received}} word that Hobbs {{was accompanied by}} law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A town meeting was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs renewed the call for the resignation of city officials, but the request was refused. Hobbs' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered Lawson to declare <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> It {{was the first time}} in Oregon since the Civil War that <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was put into effect.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> era, Manila {{became a}} hot-bed of {{resistance}} activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly {{clashed with the}} police and military which were subservient to the Marcos regime. After decades of resistance, the non-violent People Power Revolution (predecessor to the peaceful-revolutions that toppled the iron-curtain in Europe), ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs made {{international}} news when Governor West {{sent her to}} implement <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in the small Eastern Oregon town of Copperfield. The event was considered a strategic coup for West, establishing the State's authority over a remote rural community and cementing {{his reputation as a}} proponent of prohibition.|$|E
5|$|On August 2 {{as many as}} 3,000 {{troops of}} the Pennsylvania National Guard First Division arrived from Pittsburgh {{under the command of}} Major General Robert Brinton, and imposed <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> The troops had arrested an {{estimated}} 70 activists en route, and forced those apprehended to repair places where the railroad tracks between the cities had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} September 5, 1972, tourism {{minister}} Manuel Elizalde called {{each member}} of Manila's foreign press corps to a party. Imelda arrived at the party, allegedly rambling about democracy and how only the Americans could afford it. On that same day, <b>Martial</b> <b>Law</b> was announced.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 August, ten senior ARVN generals met to discuss the {{situation}} regarding the Buddhist unrest and decided <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was needed. They wanted to disperse the monks who had gathered in Saigon and other regional cities and return them to their original pagodas in the rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Trần Văn Đôn claimed communists had {{infiltrated}} {{the monks}} at Xá Lợi {{and warned that}} ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest and consequent disruption of the war effort. He claimed {{it was possible that}} the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace. Hearing this, Diệm agreed to declare <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet, and troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Don was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in place of General Lê Văn Tỵ, who was terminally ill with cancer and receiving medical treatment abroad. Đôn claimed Diệm was concerned for the welfare of the monks, allegedly telling the generals {{that he did not want}} any of them hurt. The <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> orders were then signed and authorized by Đôn.|$|E
5|$|At the State Defense Committee {{meeting on}} September 13 (the {{time of the}} Soviet Exercise Zapad-81 {{maneuvers}} and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. In March, <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1670s France became an {{increasing}} {{threat in the}} Caribbean, and Morgan {{took control of the}} defence of Port Royal. He declared <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island– because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.|$|E
5|$|County {{officials}} did not {{take care of the}} problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E
5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in his career, Jackson made a second music video for a single. This second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates; in the video Jackson is seen handcuffed. It also {{contains}} real footage of police attacking African Americans, the military crackdown of the protest in the Tiananmen Square, the Ku Klux Klan, war crimes, genocide, execution, <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> and other human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Macapagal {{lost the}} presidential {{election}} to Ferdinand Marcos. Early in his presidency, Marcos initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused of massive corruption and embezzling {{billions of dollars in}} public funds. Nearing the end of his term, Marcos declared <b>Martial</b> <b>Law</b> on September 21, 1972. This period of his rule was characterized by political repression, censorship, and human rights violations but the US were steadfast in their support.|$|E
5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period of <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell {{under the control of}} Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|In May 1862, Norfolk Mayor William Lamb {{surrendered}} {{the city}} to Union General John E. Wool and his forces. They held the city under <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> {{for the duration of}} the Civil War. Thousands of slaves from the region escaped to Union lines to gain freedom; they quickly set up schools in Norfolk to start learning how to read and write, years before the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} major defeat for the Polish right wing, the {{elections}} were won by an SLD candidate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm {{still managed to}} pass a resolution condemning the 1981 <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, {{twice as many as}} the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Lem {{cautiously}} supported the Polish dissident movement, and started publishing essays in Paris-based Kultura. In 1982, with <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in Poland declared, Lem moved to West Berlin, {{where he became}} {{a fellow of the}} Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin). After that, he settled in Vienna. He returned to Poland in 1988.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, {{acting on}} Nhu's orders, raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda, Saigon's main Buddhist temple. The attacks were {{replicated}} across the nation, leaving a death toll {{estimated to be}} in the hundreds. The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 monks and nuns were arrested. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless they were used to fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{declared}} <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in Puerto Rico {{and sent}} the Puerto Rico National Guard to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by U.S. bomber planes and ground artillery. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the nationalist party, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, were arrested and sent to jail to serve long prison terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was to {{maneuver}} troops in readiness for a coup, {{and he had}} no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer most trusted by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E
5|$|When Ferdinand Marcos {{declared}} <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> {{the sitting}} vice-president, Fernando Lopez, {{was removed from}} the office. Marcos ruled without a vice-president until 1986. The 1973 constitution initially did not provide for a vice-president, but subsequent amendments restored the office. A vice-president was able to sit after the 1986 election when the Marcos-Arturo Tolentino ticket was proclaimed winners by the Batasang Pambansa.|$|E
5|$|A riot {{that lasted}} four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers {{attempted}} to restart transit services. At its height, {{eight to ten}} thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four union members were killed. The city police were unable to control the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> {{on the evening of}} November 5.|$|E
5|$|After the Camp Jackson Affair, {{there were}} no more {{military}} threats to Union control until 1864, although guerrilla activity continued in rural areas {{for the duration of the}} war. Union General John C. Frémont placed the city under <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in August 1861 to suppress sedition; after Fremont's dismissal, Union army forces continued to suppress pro-Confederate demonstrations. The war significantly damaged St. Louis commerce, especially after the Confederacy blockaded the Mississippi shutting off St. Louis's connection to eastern markets. War also slowed growth during the 1860s, with an increase of only 43,000 residents from 1860 to 1866.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|As it was {{the middle}} of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. <b>Martial</b> <b>law</b> was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and the small number of British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. In March, <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, at least 80 people were killed during the unrest.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{previously}} held {{office at}} the Old Congress Building. In 1972, due to declaration of <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> Congress was dissolved; its successor, the unicameral Batasang Pambansa, held {{office at the}} new Batasang Pambansa Complex. When a new constitution restored the bicameral Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pasay. The Supreme Court will also transfer to its new campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Destruction of the {{newspaper}} provoked a strident call to arms from Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic of Smith. Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once the Smiths were in custody, the charges were increased to treason.|$|E
