40|$|Since pre-mRNA {{splicing}} {{is processed}} by a spliceosome {{that is a}} huge complex consists of RNAs {{and as many as}} 200 proteins, it is considered that minimum intron size is limited by molecular size of the spliceosome. To understand splicing mechanism, we investigate human intron size distribution using annotated transcriptome database, H-InvDB. Distribution of obtained intron length shows that there is a mode at 83 nt in length with 4049 transcripts and number of introns decreases drastically in shorter than 65 nt, where numbers of transcripts in each locus also decrease. However, some introns less than 65 nt are observed, both shows high Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) and also observed orthologous transcripts in other mammals. These suggests that there is a limitation in minimum length to spliced out in general splicing mechanism of human, but also unknown mechanism <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exist</b> to splice small intron exceeding the limitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 11 {{is being}} {{currently}} condisered to develop telecommunications infraestructures in industrial environments. However, in such environments there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exist</b> {{a high level}} of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) contamination, due to the machinery in use. WLANs are sensitive to this kind of hazard, and therefore the performance of the protocols may be affected inside industrial facilities. In this paper we carried out a study of the wireless link performance in these environments, using personal computing devices. Such equipments will be likely used by employees rather than conventional computers. Since results do not characterize the environment itself, but the set environment-hardware, a proper measurement test-bed must include direct measures with these devices. Besides, due to limitations in these devices, a specific protocol to measure pairs of packet error probability and latency was developed. Results show a significant linear dependency between both magnitudes, and a large correlation coefficient in the measurements under high EMF activity at mid-large ranges (distances greater than 5 meters).

40|$|A {{simple and}} compact {{apparatus}} {{was developed for}} detection of natural neutrinos {{on the basis of}} a new hypothesis. The experimental apparatus consisted of two electrodes, fiber material and purified water. Fiber materials such as raw silk, nylon and polyester were tested in measuring the output voltage generated between two electrodes. The apparatus utilizing the raw silk produced an appreciably high output voltage. After it was irradiated with intense flux of reactor neutrinos, its output voltage became higher than that of the non-irradiated one. The experimental results suggest that the voltage appears as the interaction between the natural neutrinos and the purified water: raw silk induces non vector-axial interaction. The reactor neutrinos are considered to make the non vector-axial interaction field active. Very-low energy neutrinos of 1 to 10 keV <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>existed</b> in nature...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} role of the addition of animal manure into soil on germination of sclerotia of fungi infecting cotton, including Sclerotium rolfsii, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Macrophomina phaseolina was conducted at the laboratory of Plant Science of Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Horticulture, University of Melbourne. Its effects on growth of cotton seedlings and disease severity caused by S. rolfsii was observed in a growth chamber conditions. Different source of manures affects pathogen behaviour differently. Chicken manure restrict the activity of S. rolfsii and Sc. sclerotiorum by enlarging populations of actinomycetes and bacteria in soils. When sderotia of S. rolfsii were placed on chicken manure-soil mixture, their germination was inhibited. Furthermore, hyphal lysis occurred 14 days after emerging. This manure also decreases the survival of sclerotia of S. rolfsii and Sc. sclerotiorum when the sderotia were buried for 2 - 3 months in it. Hence, the manure was able to reduce the severity of seedlings disease caused by S. rolfsii. Chicken manure provides a high nutrition for cotton growth when the seeds were sowed at least two months after incorporating. When cotton seeds were sowed in this mixtures soon after incorporated, however, the seedlings were suffered from severe phytotoxicity namely chlorosis and stunting. When seeds were sowed two months after incorporating of chicken manure into soil, there was none of phytotoxicity symptoms appeared. The growth of the seedlings was much better than that in soil. Cow manure, on the other hand, stimulated germination and growth of emerging hyphae of S. rolfsii in the short term of the experiment and increased disease severity. An abundance of readily available nutrients from this manure overcomes the inhibition of sclerotium germination caused by competition and provides nutrients for growth. These results indicate that chicken manure offers a good prospect to improve cotton growth as well as to control cotton seedling disease caused by S. rolfsii and probably other cotton pathogens. This could therefore be incorporated into soil as pre-sowing treatments. The best result is achieved when cotton seed was planted in this media at least two months after incorporating. By this time, some toxic substances which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exist</b> have degraded and sclerotia of S. rolfsii have disappeared as well.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the features of}} electroencephalography (EEG) power and coherence at rest and during a working memory task of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirty-five patients (17 males, 18 females; 52 ~ 71 years old) and 34 sex-and age-matched controls (17 males, 17 females; 51 ~ 63 years old) were recruited in the present study. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 35 patients with MCI and 34 normal controls revealed that the scores of MCI patients {{did not differ significantly}} from those of normal controls (P> 0. 05). Then, EEGs at rest and during working memory task with three levels of working memory load were recorded. The EEG power was computed over 10 channels: right and left frontal (F 3, F 4), central (C 3, C 4), parietal (P 3, P 4), temporal (T 5, T 6) and occipital (O 1, O 2); inter-hemispheric coherences were computed from five electrode pairs of F 3 -F 4, C 3 -C 4, P 3 -P 4, T 5 -T 6 and O 1 -O 2 for delta (1. 0 ~ 3. 5 Hz), theta (4. 0 ~ 7. 5 Hz), alpha- 1 (8. 0 ~ 10. 0 Hz), alpha- 2 (10. 5 ~ 13. 0 Hz), beta- 1 (13. 5 ~ 18. 0 Hz) and beta- 2 (18. 5 ~ 30. 0 Hz) frequency bands. All values of the EEG power of MCI patients were found to be higher than those of normal controls at rest and during working memory tasks. Furthermore, the values of EEG power in the theta, alpha- 1, alpha- 2 and beta- 1 bands of patients with MCI were significantly high (P< 0. 05) in comparison with those of normal controls. Correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between the EEG powers and MMSE scores. In addition, during working memory tasks, the EEG coherences in all bands were significantly higher in the MCI group in comparison with those in the control group (P< 0. 05). However, {{there was no significant difference}} in EEG coherences between two groups at rest. These findings comprise evidence that MCI patients have higher EEG power at rest, and higher EEG power and coherence during working conditions. It suggests that MCI may be associated with compensatory processes at rest and during working memory tasks. Moreover, failure of normal cortical connections <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exist</b> in MCI patients...|$|E
