40|$|Recent {{simulations}} {{and observations}} suggest that star clusters form via the assembling of smaller sub-clusters. Because of their short relaxation time, sub-clusters experience core collapse {{much earlier than}} virialized solo-clusters, which have similar properties of the merger remnant of the assembling clusters. As a consequence {{it seems that the}} assembling clusters result in efficient <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> of stars in the cluster core. We performed a series of $N$-body simulations of ensemble and solitary clusters including stellar collisions and found that the efficiency of <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> between stars are suppressed if sub-clusters assemble after they experience core collapse individually. In this case, sub-clusters form their own <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> stars which experienced a few collisions, but they fail to collide with each other after their host sub-clusters assemble. The <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> stars scatter each other and escape, and furthermore the central density of the remnant clusters had already been depleted for the stars to experience more collisions. On the other hand, if sub-clusters assemble before they experience core collapse, the <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> of stars proceed efficiently in the remnant cluster, and the collision products are more massive than virialized solo-clusters and comparable in mass to cold solo-clusters.

40|$|To {{introduce}} selection into a {{model of}} coalescence, I explore the use of modified integer partitions that allow the identification of a preferred lineage. I show that a partition-partition transition matrix, along with Monte Carlo discrete time kinetics, treats both the neutral case and {{a wide range of}} positive and negative selection pressures for small population sizes. Selection pressure causes <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> per generation, short coalescence times, increased lengths of terminal branches, increased tree asymmetry, and dependence of coalescence times on the logarithm of population size. These features are consistent with higher order coalescences that permit <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> per generation.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the class}} of haploid {{exchangeable}} population models with non-overlapping generations and population size $N$ it is shown that, as $N$ tends to infinity, convergence of the time-scaled ancestral process to Kingman's coalescent and convergence in distribution of the scaled times back {{to the most recent}} common ancestor (MRCA) to the corresponding times back to the MRCA of the Kingman coalescent are equivalent. Extensions of this equivalence are derived for exchangeable population models being in the domain of attraction of a coalescent process with <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions.</b> The proofs are based on the property that the total rates of a coalescent with <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> already determine the distribution of the coalescent.

40|$|URL: [URL] study a {{hierarchy}} of discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs) with speeds $ 0, 1,\sqrt 2 $ when, in addition to binary collisions, ternary and quaternary <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> are included: i) the square $ 9 v_i$ model, ii) an associated three dimensional $ 15 v_i$ model. Firstly we find, for shock waves, that the two equilibrium states are the same for binary alone collisions or not. We deduce, from the H-Theorem, a criterion for any <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> term. Secondly, from the knowledge of only the two equilibrium states associated to ``shock profiles" solutions we can predict whether or not overshoots for the ratios $P/M$ ($P$ for pressure, $M$ for mass and $P/M$ for internal energy) are possible. In the arbitrary parameter space of the two equilibrium states {{we are able to}} predict the subdomains where both overshoots can occur or not and the strength of the effect. These subdomains are characterized by the singularities of the propagation speed $\zeta $. Comparing with the square $ 8 v_i$ model, without rest particles, a great difference occurs for $\zeta \simeq 0 $. These predictions are independent of the fact that <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> are present or not and can be generalized to any other DBM.

In this paper, we study the design of incentive-compatible protocols for non-cooperative, multiradio channel assignment in <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> domains. First, we show the necessity of designing incentivecompatible protocols for this problem. Specifically, we show that, if no incentive-compatible protocol is deployed, Nash Equilibria (NEs) may have undesired properties, such as Pareto suboptimality and low throughput. In order to prevent the system from converging to the NEs with undesired properties, we propose an incentivecompatible protocol for channel assignment in <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> domains. We rigorously show that our protocol guarantees that the system converges to NEs that are Pareto-optimal and have the maximum system-wide throughput.
