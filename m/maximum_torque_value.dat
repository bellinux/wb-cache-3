40|$|Introduction: In this {{systematic}} review, {{we analyzed}} whether recommended <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> of 5 to 10 Ncm {{were associated with}} higher success rates of orthodontic mini-implants compared with mini-implants inserted with <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> beyond this range. Objective assessments of stability, variables that influence <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values,</b> and adverse effect of interventions were also assessed in the studies selected for our PICO (patient problem or population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) question. Methods: Computerized and manual searches of the literature were conducted up to February 24, 2012, for human studies that assessed these objectives. Our eligibility criteria selected studies that (1) used sample sizes of 10 or more, (2) recorded <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> during the insertion of orthodontic mini-implants, (3) inserted implants with a diameter smaller than 2. 5 mm, and (4) applied orthodontic forces for a minimum duration of 4 months. Confounding was assessed through the analysis of risk of bias, and the validity of outcomes was rated according to the GRADE approach. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was our main guideline for the methodology. Results: Seven nonrandomized studies met the eligibility criteria. All associations between specific <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> and success were based on literature rated as having low quality. The reasons for these judgments included subjective definitions of success, poor-quality torque sensors, and high risks for selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. A risk of multiple publication bias was also suspected. All associations between <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> and factors related to implant, patient, location, and surgery were rejected; few studies reported on adverse effects. Conclusions: Currently, no evidence indicates that specific <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> levels are associated with higher success rates for orthodontic mini-implants. Additional research on this topic is therefore necessary. The following guidelines for future studies are suggested: (1) systematically review the animal and laboratory literature, (2) perform <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> tests on artificial bone, (3) test associations in animal studies before conducting clinical trials, (4) test associations between <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> and the stability of orthodontic mini-implants with objective quantitative recordings rather than subjective qualitative measures, (5) measure <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> with digital sensors rather than with mechanical devices, (6) assess the stability of orthodontic mini-implants at preestablished times, (7) consult our risk-of-bias analysis, and (8) analyze the adverse effects of interventions.

40|$|The paper presents  a {{calculation}} of contact tensions between conjugate surfaces in sphere globoidal rusk synchronous cardan hinge {{on the condition}} that there is power balance at the constant torque on the output shaft. The required torque effect on the intake shaft at the constant angular velocity  has been calculated {{with the help of the}} Hertz’s theory of contact deformations. The maximum contact pressure has been ascertained through the torque which determines strength of the cardan hinge, its durability, wear rate in  the conjugate friction pair. The paper investigates transmission dependence of the maximum torque while changing  material quality and according to various typical sizes of the cardan hinge. Dependences of the calculated <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> on material strength have been demonstrated graphically  in the logarithmic coordinate system.   A formula for maximum contact pressure value has been derived and it determines  strength of the hinge mechanism, its durability and wear rate  in the conjugate friction pair. The effect of geometrical relationship between a spherical cam radius and a globoidal  surface radius of a hinge contact has been determined with the purpose to analyze optimal design parameters of the sphere globoidal rusk synchronous cardan hinge. It has been established that permissible torque in the hinge mechanism grows with a quadratic dependence while increasing a cam radius and  the torque is proportionally growing while increasing an axis radius of globoidal rusk surface on which spherical cams are set. The maximum permissible torque value grows with a cubic dependence while using qualitative material with thermally treated surface and application of lubrication materials which tolerates significant (up to [σ] = 1000 MPa) contact loads.   Two-fold increase of typical size of the sphere globoidal rusk synchronous cardan hinge leads to an 8 -fold increase of the permissible transmitted torque. </p...|$|E
40|$|MastersOver 50 {{years of}} {{research}} in granulation technology, whoever more researches are required to elucidate this widely applicable technology. Binder selection for particular system is quite often empirical and dependent on the skills and experience of the formulator. Hand squeeze test was and still the main way for determination of wet granulation end point. It depends mainly on operator experience, {{so it is not}} possible to be validated. Literature reveals a variety of advanced monitoring techniques following up different stages of wet massing. Torque measurement has been proved to be the most reliable control method as its tight relation to mass resistance. The first objective of this work was to investigate and optimize the influence of different variables on Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose binder solutions used as granulating agents during wet massing techniques prior to granulation step. Variables examined were the effect of polymer concentration, viscosity, addition of surfactant (Tween 80), addition of plasticizer (PEG 600), binder solution pH, and polymer grade. Mixing torque rheometer (MTR) was efficient in tracing and follow up of the interaction between liquid binder and the solid substrate providing us with the mean line torque of the wet mass and the optimum binder ratio required. The type of solid substrate (microcrystalline cellulose; Avicel PH- 101) was kept constant while variation in the liquid binder grade and/or characteristics was tested. Full factorial design was used to study the possibility of combining more than one variable simultaneously on the same binder solution. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for testing the significance of results. It was found that all HPMC concentrations were able to produce a mean line torque higher than that of the blank test. Increasing polymer molecular weight, concentration and/or viscosity caused increase in torque value of wet mass. The results showed the enhanced effect of plasticizer and surfactant on the spreading and diffusion of liquid binder inside solid substrate particles. The maximum torque amplitude of the wet mass was achieved using solution pH of about 7. 5 and addition of 2. 0 %v/v of surfactant. The second objective of this work was to investigate and optimize the influence of different variables the torque profile of Carbopol and Polyvinylpyrrolidone. Variables examined were the effect of polymer concentration, viscosity, addition of surfactant (Tween 80), addition of plasticizer (PEG 600), binder solution pH, and polymer grade. It has been found that the maximum torque of the wet mass was achieved with Carbopol and Polyvinylpyrrolidone when adding 4. 2 and 1. 0 % v/v of plasticizer as well as 3. 5 and 4. 5 % v/v of surfactant, respectively. The third objective of the current study was to study the effect of variations in the solid substrate particle size and composition on the rheological behavior of wet massing. This was done using three different liquid binders (Carbopol, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Polyvinylpyrrolidone). Extrusion-spheronization was based upon the rheological data followed be evaluation of the produced pellets. A mixer torque rheometer (MTR) methodology was used for selecting the optimum binder volume which is suitable for wet massing and consequently for extrusion-spheronization. Different methods for pellets evaluation and assessing of quality were used such as scanning electron microscopy. Theophylline as a model drug was used for the current study. Statistical analysis was performed using one way ANOVA from which differences between formulations were considered to be significant at p ≤ 0. 05. The results indicated that addition of any of the used co-excipient caused marked decrease in the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> below that of MCC alone. The influence of particle size on the dissolution behavior was of low effect while the type of the binder solution was more pronounced. Last but not least the final objective of the current study was to figure out the influence of MTR instrumental variables on the pellets quality and performance. The current study also compared between hand-made granules and pellets using wet granulation. In addition a formula composed of Avicel PH- 101 and dibasic calcium phosphate (90 : 10 % w/w) was selected for studying the ability to scale up and possibility of transfer form MTR to larger mixer types. It has been shown that. The hand-made granules showed the faster drug release within 20 minutes which may be related to their non compacted nature and higher porosity. The maximum torque was directly proportional to the mixing speed (rpm) value of MTR rotating blades. Pellets made of binder solution volume constituting the maximum torque position were of high quality. It has been shown that increasing binder volume led to decreasing friability of pellets and hand-made granules. Results showed that increasing binder volume during wet massing led to decreased pellets particle size and decreased friability. The decreased flowability of hand-made granules may be attributed to the scaly nature of their morphology which might increase the friction to each other. Scaling up from 30 gm to 500 and 1000 gm was highly successful confirming suitability of MTR as a preformulation tool...|$|E

This reclaim was blended with {{increasing amounts of}} a virgin EPDM roof-sheeting masterbatch and cured at temperatures allowing for a reversion-free vulcanization. The trends in cure characteristics showed that increasing amounts of reclaim employed in the blends lowered the reversion-free cure temperature and the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values,</b> while the vulcanization speed was increased. The insoluble fraction and crosslink density both decreased, while the ratio of mono- to di- and polysulfidic crosslinks increased with growing reclaim contents. A SEM-EDX morphology study of the blends, in order to evaluate the dispersion of the reclaim into the virgin rubber matrix showed, that even large amounts of reclaimed material resulted in homogeneous and smooth compounds. Tensile strength, modulus at 300 % strain and hardness decreased, while elongation at break, tear strength and compression set at 70 degrees C increased with increasing reclaim ratios. Irrespective of the blend ratios, the mechanical properties all fulfilled the most stringent UEAtc specifications for EPDM roof-sheeting.

40|$|Non-hospitable {{areas are}} {{frequently}} being explored for new energy resources {{and most of}} these places are ice covered. Understanding the interactions between a ship 2 ̆ 019 s propeller and sea ice is fundamental in the production and manufacturing of podded propulsors. The test facilities here at IOT were used to conduct experiments whereby a model-podded propeller was used in the ice tank and propeller-ice interaction parameters were measured and recorded by the use of dynamometers. Tests were conducted using the two operating conditions, (tractor and pusher), different depths of cut, varying azimuth angles, and a range of propeller rotational speeds and carriage velocities. The analysis of ice loads in pusher mode is different to that of tractor mode because of the un-uniform ice conditions experienced during pusher mode. The acquired results must be represented in either individual blade angular positions or individual revolutions. This can be easily done with computer programs such as Sweet. Parameters, such as advance coefficient, thrust coefficient, and torque coefficient, can be calculated from the newly represented data.

40|$|The high-energy {{ultrasound}} {{could be}} used to devulcanize rubber as it can focus energy into localized sites for selective bond rupture. The research work reported to date suggests that the ultrasonic technology is more suited to convert rubber waste to a usable material efficiently, effectively and environmental friendly. The ultrasonic devulcanization reactor consisted of three main sections, namely a power source, ultrasonic transducer with sample holding unit, and a monitoring system to measure the amplitude, frequency and power. N-cyclohexyl- 2 -benzthiazyl sulfenamide (CBS) accelerated unfilled natural rubber vulcanized with conventional sulfur vulcanizing system and with efficient sulfur vulcanizing system were used as the model rubber compounds in these experiments. 2 mm thick vulcanized rubber sheets were directly kept on the vibrating diaphragm of the ultrasonic transducer. The frequency of ultrasonic wave was varied in a range of 20 to 50 kHz and the power level was varied up to 800 watt. The treatment time was limited to 10 minutes when treated at high power levels. The vibrating amplitudes were measured at different power levels with the variation of ultrasonic frequency. Curing behaviour, gel content and cross-link density were studied for rubber samples devulcanized at different process conditions. The increase in cross-link density and gel content of the samples treated at lower amplitudes indicated the formation of additional cross-links. However, the higher vibrational energies associated with high amplitudes resulted in lower cross-link densities and gel contents indicating a breakdown of bonds. Cure curves of virgin and devulcanized NR samples suggested that the fast initial curing of devulcanized NR was due to the presence of active sufidized rubber molecules formed due to break down of some cross-links during devulcanization. The lower <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> observed in the devulcanized samples were due to the partial breakdown of C-C bonds in the main chain. The tensile properties of the revulcanized samples gave comparable results with that of virgin rubber. A theoretical process model was developed to express the extent of devulcanization in terms of cross-link density. It was based on the vibrational energy transfer mechanism. The model treated the vulcanized rubber as a pure elastic solid containing void regions. Experimental and theoretical values lied within ± 10 % error limits. The model showed that the media effect on the nature of void excitation was significant and the viscoelasticity was also considerable. However, the effect due to surface tension was negligible...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} for failure at three different drill pipes. When drilling boreholes, for example in the Oil & Gas industry, a hole is drilled into the ground which can be several kilometers long. One of main type of problem that can occur while drilling is the torque on the drill pipe can cause it to break (called twist-off). This problem results in drilling delays. Twist-offs also usually results in loss of expensive equipment. Therefore, ALGOR software has been use as the FEA tool to do the analysis to reduce this problem. Six different <b>values</b> of <b>torque</b> range from 2000 N. m to 3000 N. m {{is applied to the}} end of the pipe stand which is consist of three assembly of pipes. The materials of the pipe have been chosen are AISI 1010, ASTM A 36 and AISI 4150 steels that have different mechanical properties the see the differences. The test results show that AISI 4150 is the most suitable material to use which gives 2800 N. m <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> before it starts to fail. Meanwhile, a constant pattern of failure has determined for these three pipes at the same location of the second engaged thread of the pipe assembly, between the male and female thread at the joint. For improvement, to see the differences from another point of view, the analysis for this drill pipe design is suggested to do with different thickness and length in order to analyze how much the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> can be applied to the pipe before it starts to fail...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) Abstract: A {{fundamental}} shift towards {{alternative sources of}} energy particularly in the transport sector {{has led to the}} use of fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas in spark ignition (SI) engines. However, these fuels retain the challenges associated with fossil fuels which are primarily their finite reserves and negative effects on the ecosystem. This study assesses the use of biogas, a renewable and environmentally friendly high octane fuel in the more popular spark ignition powered passenger vehicle using the simplest single-point fuel delivery conversion kit available on the market. The vehicle powered by a 1. 5 litre 1 UF-ZE spark ignition engine was converted to a bi-fuel vehicle. Torque, power, and transient emissions were measured with a single roller chassis dynamometer and a gas analyser while running on vehicle quality biogas also referred to as biomethane. The data collated from the use of biogas was pitched with that of petrol in the same system to compare performance and tailpipe emissions. The biogas was simulated by mixing 95 % methane (CH 4) with 5 % carbon dioxide (CO 2). The experiments also afforded the opportunity to validate biogas similarity with natural gas (CNG) when used to power vehicles. The research further looked into enhancing system efficiency by investigating the addition of a measure of 2 % hydrogen to create a biomethane-hydrogen mix (HCBG) which is within allowable limits of the mix used in a conventional spark ignition (SI) system to curb the negative impacts associated with hydrogen use as a fuel in internal combustion engines. The HCBG was derived by mixing 93 % CH 4 with 5 % CO 2 and 2 % H 2. Biogas recorded a reduction of 16 % in <b>maximum</b> power and <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> when pitched with petrol while similar <b>maximum</b> power and <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> to that of biogas were derived from the experiments using natural gas to power the same vehicle. When the hydrogen-biomethane mix was utilised, a 1 % power drop was noticed. However, slight increments in power and <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> at mid-speed ranges showed promise for higher hydrogen concentrations in the HCBG in fine-tuned systems. With respect to the mass emission of pollutants, the Inspection and Maintenance 240 (IM 240) Drive Cycle was employed to determine the carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide(CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous oxide (NOx) values in grammes per kilometer (g/km). Biogas recorded an 18 % CO 2 emission reduction compared to the data obtained using petrol (152. 2 g/km). With reference to biogas, CNG recorded 0. 4 g/km more CO 2 mass emissions while the enhanced HCBG [...] ...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a resistência à fratura de instrumentos rotatórios de níquel-titânio por meio de ensaio de torção. Foram avaliados os sistemas Profile 0, 04 / 0, 06 (Dentsply/Maillefer) e K 3 (Kerr), perfazendo um total de 300 limas, as quais foram divididas em 5 grupos: Grupo A (Profile 0, 04), Grupo B (Profile 0, 06), Grupo C (K 3 0, 04), Grupo D (K 3 0, 06), Grupo E (Protaper). Os instrumentos foram submetidos a ensaio de torção por meio de um dispositivo acoplado à uma máquina de ensaios mecânicos MTS (Material Test System). Esta máquina era conectada à um microcomputador onde foram registrados os valores de carga máxima aplicada a cada lima. Tais valores foram, posteriormente aos testes, convertidos em torque (em N. cm), seguindo a fórmula: <b>torque</b> = carga <b>máxima</b> x raio. Os valores de torque máximo para fratura foram analisados estatisticamente pelo teste t de Student. Os resultados mostraram que instrumentos de maiores conicidades (Grupo B e D) são mais resistentes à fratura do que os de conicidades menores (Grupo A e C). Os instrumentos K 3 0, 06 necessitam de maiores valores de torque máximo para fratura em relação aos Protaper. Observamos ainda que os instrumentos do sistema K 3 foram significativamente mais resistentes à fratura torcional do que os instrumentos do sistema Profile. Porém, os resultados mostraram não haver diferenças significativas na resistência à fratura entre os sistemas Profile 0, 04, Profile 0, 06 e K 3 0, 04 quando comparados ao sistema Protaper, da mesma forma que quando comparamos os sitemas Profile 0, 04 com o K 3 0, 04. Porém, quando a comparação foi feita entre instrumentos Profile 0, 06 e K 3 0, 06, os últimos mostraram-se mais resistentes à fratura que os primeiros. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the resistance of different nickel-titanium rotary instruments to the fracture by means of torsion test. Profile 0, 04 / 0, 06 (Dentsply/Maillefer), Protaper (Dentsply/Maillefer) and K 3 ENDO (Kerr) systems were evaluated, resulting in 300 files which were divided in 5 groups: Group A (Profile 0, 04), Group B(Profile 0, 06), Group C (K 3 0, 04), Group D (K 3 0, 06), Group E (Protaper). The instruments were subjected to torsion test by means of an appliance coupled to a mechanical test machine MTS (Material Test System). This machine was connected to a microcomputer in which was registered the values of maximum load applied to each file. Such values were, after the tests, converted to torque (in N. cm), following the formula: torque=maximum load x radius. <b>Maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> for fracture were analyzed statistically by the Student's t. The results showed that more taper instruments (Groups B and D) are more resistant to fracture than the less taper ones (Groups A and C). The K 3 0, 06 instruments need higher <b>values</b> of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> to fracture with relation to Protaper's ones. We also noticed that the instruments from K 3 system were significantly more resistant to the torsion fracture than the Profile system instruments. However, the results showed that there are not significant differences in the resistance to the fracture among the systems Profile 0, 04, Profile 0, 06 and K 3 0, 04 when they were compared to Protaper system, as the same way when we compare Profile 0, 04 systems to K 3 0, 04...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{stimulation}} is {{a promising}} {{technology for the}} restoration of arm function in paralysed individuals. Control of the paralysed arm under electrical stimulation, however, is a challenging problem that requires advanced controllers and command interfaces for the user. A real-time model describing the complex dynamics of the arm would allow user-in-the-loop type experiments where the command interface and controller could be assessed. Real-time models of the arm previously de-scribed have not included the ability to model the independently controlled scapula and clavicle, limiting their utility for clinical applications of this nature. The goal of this study therefore was to evaluate the performance and mechanical behaviour of a real-time, dynamic model of the arm and shoulder girdle. The model comprises seven segments linked by eleven degrees of freedom and actuated by 138 muscle elements. Polynomials were gener-ated to describe the muscle lines of action to reduce computation time, and an implicit, first-order Rosenbrock formulation of the equations of motion was used to increase simulation step-size. The model simulated flexion of the arm faster than real time, simulation time being 92 % of actual movement time on standard desktop hardware. Modelled <b>maximum</b> isometric <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> agreed well with values from the literature, showing that the model simulates the moment-generating behaviour of a real human arm. The speed of the model enables experiments where the user controls the virtual arm and receives visual feedback in real time. The ability to optimise potential solutions in simulation greatly reduces the burden on the user during development. Index Terms—musculoskeletal modelling, forward dynamics, shoulder, biomechanics.

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} joint torque pattern and dynamic joint {{stiffness}} {{at the knee}} and ankle in elderly and young men during stepping down. Background. Adequate joint stiffness is critical during the single support phase to control forward and downward body momentum. Design. Six active elderly men (mean 67. 7) and six young men (mean 23. 6) of similar body mass and height, were filmed stepping down from one force platform to another. Repeated trials were undertaken at three different step heights (200, 250, and 300 mm). Method. Joint torques were determined for the ankle and knee of the support limb throughout the single support phase. The gradient of the joint torque-angle graph was calculated to define dynamic joint stiffness of the ankle and knee in two phases; (I) from initiation of movement until heel-off of the supporting limb, and (II) from heel-off of the supporting limb to contra-limb touch down. Results. <b>Maximum</b> ankle <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> were lower in the elderly and occurred at a larger dorsiflexion angle (P< 0. 05). Knee torque patterns were similar in both groups. Phase I ankle stiffness was significantly less in the elderly (4. 0 - 5. 2 Nm/°) at all step heights compared to the young (7. 6 - 8. 7 Nm/°). In both groups ankle stiffness in Phase II increased with step height, while knee joint stiffness decreased. Conclusions. The different torque pattern and lower dynamic ankle stiffness in the elderly, particularly for Phase I, suggested an altered control strategy. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic ankle joint stiffness in stepping down. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|As {{is known}} gaseous fuels, such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas (NG), {{thanks to their}} good mixing capabilities, allow {{complete}} and cleaner combustion than normal gasoline, resulting in lower pollutant emissions and particulate matter. Some of the automobile producers already put on the market “bi-fuel” engines, which may be fed either with standard gasoline or with LPG. These engines, endowed of two separate injection systems, are originally designed for gasoline operation; hence they do not fully exploit the good qualities of LPG, such as its better knocking resistance, which would allow higher compression ratios. Moreover, when running with gasoline at medium high loads, the engine is often operated with rich mixture and low spark advance (with respect to the <b>maximum</b> brake <b>torque</b> <b>value)</b> {{in order to prevent}} from dangerous knocking phenomena: this produces both high hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and high fuel consumption. Starting from these observations, the authors experimentally investigated on the simultaneous combustion of LPG- gasoline mixtures in stoichiometric proportion with air (with different LPG/gasoline mass ratios), so as to exploit the good qualities of both fuels to obtain cleaner and more efficient combustions: the addition of LPG to the gasoline-air mixture in fact raises knocking resistance, allowing thus to run the engine with both “overall stoichiometric” mixture and more efficient spark advance even at full load, while the stoichiometric A/F ratio allows to minimize pollutant emissions. In this paper the authors present the results of an extensive experimental study in terms of engine efficiency increments and reduction of pollutant emissions with respect to the pure gasoline operation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the absolute and relative reliability of fatigue indicators calculated from peak torque and total work during isokinetic speeds of 60, 90, 120 and 180 ?? ??? s- 1 during a hip abductor-adductor fatigue protocol. Ten males suffering from unilateral functional ankle instability and ten male healthy controls performed five maximal concentric contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer. Following a four minute rest period subjects were instructed to perform repeated maximal concentric contractions to fatigue, which was defined as three consecutive repetitions below 50 % of the <b>maximum</b> peak <b>torque</b> <b>value.</b> Each testing speed of 60, 90, 120 and 180 ?? ??? s- 1 was randomised and repeated on two separate days that were seven days apart. Peak torque and total work were calculated for each repetition and summed to compute cumulated performance for each of the testing speeds. Muscle fatigue was determined for each testing speed by the fatigue index, the percent decrease in performance and the slope of the regression equation. The most reliable fatigue determination method was the slope of the regression equation, when testing at a speed of 120 ?? ??? s- 1. The choice of either peak torque or total work to assess average performance during the fatigue test did not influence relative or absolute reliability. The same conclusion applied to the speed of the isokinetic dynamometer as relative and absolute reliability values were not influenced by a change in speed. It is recommended that future investigators examine and plot their data before choosing the slope of the regression equation as their fatigue indicator, as a linear model is required...|$|R

The proposed system provides mechanical characteristics with constant <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> or increased <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and reduced slip speed at frequencies below the nominal frequency. The control algorithm {{is based on}} the constant volts per hertz principle using two improvement techniques: keeping <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> constant or keeping magnetic flux constant. Performance analysis of the system under different operation conditions was provided. For this purpose, a standard state-space model of three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor, with respect to a synchronously rotating d-q reference frame was derived. The correctness and validity of the derived model of induction motor was verified. The inverter was considered as a static linear element and modeled through its input-output equation based on the modulation index. Three types of controllers were modeled, simulated and experimentally tested. The results show that both suggested control methods improve the system performance. The slip speed has been decreased and the starting <b>torque</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> have been increased. Controller with constant <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> can be used in drive systems working with constant load, while controller with constant flux can be used in drive systems working with constant power.
