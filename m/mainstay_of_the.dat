5|$|For centuries, {{oyster farming}} {{has been a}} <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} economy. However, in December 2009, commercial harvesting was suspended after the norovirus was discovered in several exported crops, resulting in a recall.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{industries}} and stone mines {{on both sides}} of the river were eventually exhausted and closed. Tourists coming up the river from Port Jervis became the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy. During the next two decades, seasonal homes and hotels were built in Pond Eddy.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{island is}} now ecological tourism, based around the farmhouse, which is {{operated by the}} Lihou Charitable Trust, although overall responsibility for the island remains with the Environment Department of the States of Guernsey. Lihou and several other small Channel Islands such as Herm and Sark, issued their own stamps until 1969, when the States of Guernsey assumed responsibility for postal services in the Bailiwick, which had previously been provided by the UK Government.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Greek diet was bread, {{and this}} was {{accompanied}} by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{industry}} {{for many years}} but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{economy of}} this part of Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-nineteenth century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{fishing and}} <b>the</b> {{production}} <b>of</b> limestone and cement are <b>the</b> <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy.|$|R
50|$|Farming and crofting are <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy, {{especially}} livestock husbandry. Flocks {{of sheep}} are also kept on Faray.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture (primarily rice) and {{forestry}} are <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy. The {{consumer electronics}} company Sharp {{has a large}} factory in Yaita.|$|R
5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malagasy economy. Land is {{used for}} the {{cultivation}} of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for Queensland {{selection for}} the whole 195253 season. He was recalled {{at the start of}} the 195354 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales, failing to convert his starts into big scores. He was retained despite making 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria, but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day. Victoria were set 329 for victory, and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far, he was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings, scoring 102, but his team were all out for 245.|$|E
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
50|$|Gas and oil {{exploration}} {{has resulted in}} large number <b>of</b> wells in <b>the</b> area. Coal mining, tourism and agriculture are <b>the</b> main economic <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|Storytelling was a <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Igbo {{tradition}} and {{an integral part}} of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books– including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Morris was the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings, scoring 112 as Australia batted first and made 236. The Scots replied with 85 and {{were forced to}} follow on. Morris led the wicket-taking in the second innings, taking 5/10 from five overs as the hosts fell for 111 to hand the Australians an innings victory. He {{continued}} his success in the second match, taking three of Scotland's first four batsmen to end with 3/17 as the hosts fell for 178. Batting at No. 7, Morris made 10 as Australia declared at 6/407 and bowled four overs for eight runs without taking a wicket as Bradman’s men ended the tour with another innings victory.|$|E

25|$|Offshore banking, manufacturing, {{and tourism}} form key sectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. Agriculture and fishing, once <b>the</b> <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy, now make declining {{contributions}} to the island's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{and light}} {{manufacturing}} are <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy, with production of Kanpyō, turmeric and spinach being prominent local crops. The city is increasingly a bedroom community for neighboring Utsunomiya.|$|R
5|$|As the VPAF {{pilots were}} {{completing}} the final phases of their conversion training, the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. On {{the afternoon of}} April 27, the pilots were flown out to Phù Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major-General Le Van Tri, commander of the VPAF, briefed them on the upcoming operation. Tri also instructed the pilots {{to ensure that their}} bombs should not hit civilian areas in Saigon. From the original group of trainees, Luc, De, Quang, Vuong, Trung and On were selected {{to take part in the}} attack. Meanwhile, On and Xanh were also instructed to test-fly five captured A-37 bombers, which would be the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quyet Thang Squadron. On the morning of April 28, the Quyet Thang Squadron became operational with Luc as the squadron's commander, when it was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base.|$|E
5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and {{to limit the}} power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the <b>mainstay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nez Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E
50|$|Culbert was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{side that}} were {{promoted}} to the division {{for the first time}} when they ended their 1932-33 campaign with a victory over divisional champions Hibs.|$|R
50|$|Aside from tourism, {{agriculture}} and fishing are <b>the</b> <b>mainstays</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local economy. Izu is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest producers <b>of</b> wasabi in Japan, {{and the local}} cuisine offers dishes flavored with wasabi.|$|R
