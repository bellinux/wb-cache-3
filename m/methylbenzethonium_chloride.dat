The treatment group included 35 patients, and the placebo group included 33 patients. The initial clinical response rate (13 weeks after completing the treatment) was 91. 4 % in the treatment group and 39. 4 % in the placebo group. The final clinical response rate at the 12 -month followup examination was 85. 7 % (31 of 35) in the treatment group and 39. 4 % (13 of 33) in the placebo group (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001). In general, the treatment was well tolerated and was never interrupted because of adverse effects. The number of adverse effects reported in the placebo group was lower than in the treatment group (16 events versus 30 events).

40|$|Millions {{of people}} {{worldwide}} {{are suffering from}} cutaneous leishmaniasis that is caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. Although pentavalent antimony compounds are the treatment of choice, their use is limited by high cost, poor compliance, and systemic toxicity. Paromomycin was developed to overcome such limitations. However, {{there is no consensus}} on its efficacy. This meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of paromomycin compared with placebo and pentavalent antimony compounds. Fourteen randomized controlled trials, including 1, 221 patients, met our selection criteria. Topical paromomycin appeared to have therapeutic activity against the old world and new world cutaneous leishmaniasis, with increased local reactions, when combined with <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Topical paromomycin was not significantly different from intralesional pentavalent antimony compounds in treating the old world form, whereas it was inferior to parenteral pentavalent antimony compounds in treating the new world form. However, a similar efficacy was found between parenteral paromomycin and pentavalent antimony compounds in treating the new world form. Fewer systemic side effects were observed with topical and parenteral paromomycin than pentavalent antimony compounds. These results suggest that topical paromomycin with <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> could be a therapeutic alternative to pentavalent antimony compounds for selected cases of the old world cutaneous leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|Monge-Maillo and López-Vélez {{address the}} {{important}} issues of whether topical paromomycin treatments for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) achieve a higher cure rate {{when combined with}} another antileishmanial agent {{and the risk of}} mucosal leishmaniasis when cutaneous disease is treated locally. We agree with these writers that combinations of paromomycin with other drugs {{are likely to be more}} effective than paromomycin alone. Although the writers focus on a com-bination with <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (MBCL), we focus on a combination with gentamicin given significant adverse reactions noted with use of MBCL, 1, 2 strong animal data for paromomycin-plus-gentamicin, 3 and the trend to increased effi-cacy from paromomycin-plus-gentamicin versus paromomycin-alone in the phase 2 study under discussion. 4 When the data from our present phase 3 trial of paromomycin-plus-gentamici...|$|E

40|$|Topical treatment, with drug-containing ointments, of {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in BALB/c mice was studied. Twenty chemotherapeutic agents having potential or established antileishmanial activity were formulated in different ointment and cream bases. Only 15 % paromomycin sulfate with 12 % <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> 12 % benzethonium chloride, 12 % cetalkonium chloride, or 12 % dimethyl sulfoxide, all incorporated in white soft paraffin (United Kingdom patent application no. 2117237 A), were completely effective. Topical treatment twice daily for 6 {{or more days}} caused total elimination of the parasites and healing of the lesion in all treated mice. All the other antileishmanial compounds, including sodium stibogluconate, pentamidine, amphotericin B, emetine hydrochloride, metronidazole, co-trimoxazole, allopurinol, and rifampin, either showed a slight effect on the parasites or were highly toxic to the animal host at the concentrations tested...|$|E

40|$|Sixty-seven patients, 19 {{females and}} 48 males, 4 - 66 years old, {{suffering}} from lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis were treated topically with an ointment comprising 15 % paromomycin sulfate and 12 % <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in white soft paraffin (P-ointment, U. K. patent GB 117237 A). After 10 days of treatment, twice daily, the lesions in 72 % of the treated patients were free of parasites, 15 % became free within an additional 20 days, without further treatment, and 13 % failed to respond. Pigmentation developed in 18 % of the treated lesions and inflammation of varying degree {{was associated with}} the treatment. These developments did not affect the clinical healing process which was generally completed in a period of 10 - 30 days after termination of treatment. In addition, 94 % of the treated lesions healed with little or no scarring. No adverse clinical or laboratory side effects were observed except for a burning sensation at the site of treatment. Parasites isolated from patients who failed to respond to topical treatment were found to be susceptible to PR-MBCI in both in vitro infected macrophages and in vivo in experimentally infected BALB/c mice...|$|E
40|$|Background: High cost, poor compliance, and {{systemic}} toxicity have limited {{the use of}} pentavalent antimony compounds (SbV), the treatment of choice for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Paromomycin (PR) has been developed {{as an alternative to}} SbV, but existing data are conflicting. Methodology/Principal Findings: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, without language restriction, through August 2007, to identify randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy or safety between PR and placebo or SbV. Primary outcome was clinical cure, defined as complete healing, disappearance, or reepithelialization of all lesions. Data were extracted independently by two investigators, and pooled using a randomeffects model. Fourteen trials including 1, 221 patients were included. In placebo-controlled trials, topical PR appeared to have therapeutic activity against the old world and new world CL, with increased local reactions, when used with <b>methylbenzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (MBCL) compared to when used alone (risk ratio [RR] for clinical cure, 2. 58 versus 1. 01 : RR for local reactions, 1. 60 versus 1. 07). In SbV-controlled trials, the efficacy of topical PR was not significantly different from that of intralesional SbV in the old world CL (RR, 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 26 – 1. 89), whereas topical PR was inferior to parenteral SbV in treating the new world CL (0. 67; 0. 54 – 0. 82). No significant difference in efficacy was found between parenteral PR and parenteral SbV in the new world CL (0. 88; 0. 56 – 1. 38). Systemic side effects were fewer with topical o...|$|E
