50|$|Until {{the late}} 1980s Godda {{was full of}} forests and was a remote place far from science and {{technology}} and {{was living in a}} dark age as other districts of Jharkhand. The entire scenario changed after coal was first discovered in abundance under the Rajmahal Hills by a team of the Geological Survey of India. Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. conducted a detailed survey of the area. The Rajmahal Opencast Coal mine project was conceived in early 1980s, initially to supply coal to Farakka Super Thermal Power Project of NTPC, with an initial annual capacity of 5 <b>million</b> <b>tonne.</b> For expansion of this coal mine project to 10.5 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> per annum, an agreement was signed between Coal India Limited and Canadian Commercial Corporation in January 1989 where MET-CHEM Canada Inc. was designated as the Canadian Executing Agency for implementing the project. The Project was completed in July 1994 and is being run by Eastern Coalfileds Limited personnel. This mine is producing 11.5 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> coal per annum.

40|$|Fly ash is {{a finely}} divided residue {{resulting}} from the combustion of bituminous coal or lignite in a thermal power plant. Indian coals have on an average 45 % ash content. Currently India generates around 95 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> of ash per year. It is likely to reach 125 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> mark by 2005 and 180 million by 2012. Research work of large number of agencies {{in the country and}} actual utilisations abroad have exhibited worth of flyash. However, may be due to lack of local experience, utilisation of flyash did not pick up in India, till a few years ago. Fly Ash Mission, established by Government of India in 1994 is providing a focussed thrust to develop local experiences and thus building up of confidence in techno- economic viability of flyash utilisations as well as safe disposal of un-utilised ashes. More than 50 technology demonstration projects implemented in the field have led to beginning of acceptance of fly ash as a resource material. Number of multiplier effects have started. Utilisation has increased from a meagre 1. 5 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> during 1994 (3 % of generation) to about 15 <b>million</b> <b>tonne</b> during the year 2000 (15 % of generation).
