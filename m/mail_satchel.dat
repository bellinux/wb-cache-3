50|$|A <b>mail</b> <b>satchel</b> is {{a device}} letter {{carriers}} use over-the-shoulder for assisting {{the delivery of}} personal mail to businesses and homes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mail</b> <b>satchel</b> {{is a type}} of mail {{bag that}} a letter carrier uses over-the-shoulder for {{assisting}} the delivery of personal mail on a designated route.|$|E
50|$|As {{one might}} expect, {{the form and}} {{structure}} of <b>mail</b> <b>satchels</b> has implications for fatigue and industrial injuries to mail carriers.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of various}} uniforms worn by {{military}} couriers and mail carriers from the Constitutional {{era in the}} beginning of the 20th century and from the Republican era after 1923 to present time can be seen fitted on dolls and mannequins. Historical postal service items like <b>mail</b> <b>satchels,</b> <b>mail</b> pouches, mail sacks, letter boxes, locator maps, franking machines from the Ottoman and Republican era are on display.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the general trend in mail deliveries is a decrease in letter volume {{and an increase in}} the number and size of packages; bulk and weight increased so mail delivery methods had to be changed as a result. In one intracampus mail system, it was found that the use of Segways decreased emissions. [...] "Increasingly heavier trays were leading to workplace accidents, exhaustion and dissatisfaction." [...] Segway PTs fitted with custom mail bags, a derivative of the over-the-shoulder personal <b>mail</b> <b>satchels,</b> were seen as a cure for the postmen for many of these problems.|$|R
5000|$|A U.S. [...] "satchel cart" [...] (caddy cart, {{container}} cart), United Kingdom [...] "mail trolley" [...] (postman's cart) or the European / Asian [...] "mail bike" [...] is {{an accessory}} tool for letter carriers of cities to assist their normal everyday over-the-shoulder heavy <b>mail</b> <b>satchel.</b> This type of accessory {{is used to}} cut down on return trips to the postal vehicle to collect or drop off mail. In Britain, mail trolleys are controversial, and viewed as a threat by some to the viability of bicycles, which use a form of satchel bag. [...] A [...] "mail trolley" [...] is used in the United Kingdom in addition to bikes for the [...] "postmen". [...] It is also an employee safety feature because the cart is carrying the load, which could be up to 70 pounds, where a hand over-the-shoulder <b>mail</b> <b>satchel</b> for letter carriers carries up to 35 pounds of mail.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Phipps {{filed an}} {{application}} under the Ontario Human Rights Code alleging {{that he had}} been discriminated against in respect of services because of his race with regard to an incident with police in 2005. Mr. Phipps was employed by Canada Post and was delivering mail in an affluent neighbourhood. He was wearing his uniform jacket, carrying his <b>mail</b> <b>satchel,</b> and delivering regular mail and flyers. He was stopped by police and had his identity checked, the police then proceeded to trail him and check his identity with a homeowner and a white letter carrier. The police did not check the identity or find suspicious any of the other unfamiliar people in the area, all of whom were white. Applying Nassiah v Peel and other jurisprudence, the Tribunal found that this was a clear case of discrimination, specifically racial profiling.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a letter}} carrier uses a push cart, the normal 35-pound mail load limit does not apply. The two satchels on the cart are filled to {{capacity}} on each use, which could {{be as much as}} twice the normal 35-pound over-the-shoulder <b>satchel</b> <b>mail</b> load limit.|$|R
