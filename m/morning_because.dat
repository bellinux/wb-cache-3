5|$|In the {{previous}} episode, Keith proves {{the innocence of}} convicted murderer Koontz, who had falsely confessed to murdering Lilly. Veronica, who believed {{that she had been}} raped {{the previous}} year at a party, discovers that she and Duncan had sex while under the influence of GHB; Duncan left that next <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> he believed Veronica was his sister. Veronica spends time with her boyfriend Logan in his pool house, but discovers a hidden video system linking to cameras focused on the bed. Veronica is shocked and goes home, only to find her mother Lianne has returned from rehab.|$|E
5|$|Przemysł II {{was born}} on 14 October 1257 in Poznań as the fifth child and only son of Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and his wife Elisabeth, {{daughter}} of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia. It is known that {{he was born in}} the <b>morning,</b> <b>because</b> according to the Chronicle of Greater Poland, when Dowager Duchess Elisabeth gave birth to a son, the vicars and canons of the city were singing morning prayers. At the news of the birth, the local clergy chanted the Te Deum laudamus. Shortly after his birth, the prince was baptized by the Bishop of Poznań, Bogufał III.|$|E
5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following <b>morning.</b> <b>Because</b> Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E
50|$|In April 2005, it was {{alleged that}} a wind turbine {{situated}} near Whitemoor Prison was being switched {{off in the}} early <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> the flickering shadows it created annoyed inmates. The turbine had been halted because of possible security problems if prisoners became upset over the flickering shadows.|$|R
5000|$|The night-time train {{started from}} [...] every-day, {{connecting}} with Eurostar continental services, with the train arriving at 02.38 Tuesday to Saturday mornings, and 01.00 Sunday and Monday <b>mornings.</b> <b>Because</b> of this later arrival on Tuesday to Saturday, this arriving service ran empty to Carmarthen rather than form a return journey.|$|R
50|$|In August 2014, WNCN began {{producing}} a 9:00-10:00 a.m. newscast on Saturday and Sunday <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> the weather cut-in through The Today Show showed the radar that boosted the debut. Then the weekend after, it debuted a Saturday morning newscast from 6:00-7:00 and 9:00-10:00 a.m., with a Sunday morning newscast from 7:00-8:00 and 9:00-10:00 a.m..|$|R
25|$|Tortillas are {{consumed}} daily. Factory-made tortillas are widely sold, {{and they can}} easily be home-made. Tortilla production starts from early <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> lunch is the main meal of the day for most people. In Mexico, lunch is eaten between 1:30p.m. and 3:30p.m. Some supermarkets and grocery stores sell tortillas throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{all of the}} {{services}} are conducted {{on a daily basis}} only in monasteries and cathedrals, while parish churches might only do {{the services}} on the weekend and major feast days. On certain Great Feasts (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a special All-Night Vigil (Agrypnia) will be celebrated from late at night {{on the eve of the}} feast until early the next <b>morning.</b> <b>Because</b> of its festal nature it is usually followed by a breakfast feast shared together by the congregation.|$|E
25|$|The attack, {{which began}} in the early {{afternoon}} of 13 January—postponed from the <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> of a persistent mist and a slow advance by artillery across the river—quickly lost the intended element of surprise, as the outnumbered British forces on both sides of enemy lines struggled to assert themselves against a robust Ottoman defense. Kemball made a frontal advance, while Younghusband, with the bulk of the British force, attempted a wide turning movement. The delay seriously affected the chances of success, as small-arms and artillery fire from the alerted Ottoman forces began to halt the British infantry movements.|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle engine exhaust, {{particularly}} from motor scooters, {{is a source}} of air pollution in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution. Occasionally, dust storms from Mainland China can temporarily bring extremely poor air quality to the city.|$|R
50|$|The station {{became a}} Heroes & Icons {{affiliate}} on October 21, 2014, while Me-TV relocated to WFIE-DT2. Then on January 17, 2015, WTSN replaced its Heroes and Icons affiliation with Heartland's E/I programming repeats from its sister station on Saturday <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> of its Sunday religious and local programming {{up until the}} Heartland affiliation with WYYW-CD ended.|$|R

25|$|The {{parliamentary}} {{agenda was}} obviously {{affected by the}} events of April 25. The day after the fire, a special meeting {{of the members of the}} Legislative Assembly was convened to meet at 10:00am in the hall of the Bonsecours Market, under the protection of British soldiers. On that day, the MPPs accomplished nothing other than appointing a committee responsible to report on the bills that were destroyed. Their report was presented to the House a week later on May 2. Lafontaine was not present that <b>morning,</b> <b>because</b> he assisted to the wedding of lawyer Amable Berthelot, his associate in law, who was marrying the adoptive daughter of judge Elzéar Bédard. The Legislative Assembly kept meeting at Bonsecours Market until May 7, after which date the parliament was convened in a building owned by Moses Judas Hayes on Place Dalhousie.|$|E
25|$|When General Nicolás de Mahy {{assembled}} 5,000 troops, Junot ordered Clausel's {{division to}} oppose them, while sending Solignac's division {{and one of}} Lagrange's brigades into the trenches. Saint-Croix routed a Spanish detachment on 10 April near Alcañizas. On 15 April the small siege train finally arrived and the guns were mounted in batteries. By noon on the 21st a breach was battered in the wall at the northwest corner. The evening, 700 men from the elite companies of the 47th Line Infantry and Irish Regiments seized the breach and a house just inside the wall. Though they were blocked from advancing any farther, Santocildes capitulated the next <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> his men had shot away most of their ammunition. The siege cost the French 160 killed and 400 wounded of whom 112 were killed and 294 were wounded in the assault. The Spanish suffered only 51 killed and 109 wounded, but 2,500 were captured.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Crane was {{intermittently}} {{employed as}} a free-lance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the <b>morning.</b> <b>Because</b> he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E
50|$|After being rebranded as Global, Global Montreal aired a live two and {{a half-hour}} (and {{subsequently}} three) hour weekday morning magazine program called This Morning Live. It was aired in place of cartoons that aired on most Global stations weekday <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> Quebec provincial law requires children's programming to be shown weekdays commercial-free over the air. A side benefit of this was that it added enough Canadian content to the station's schedule that it could air American talk shows in the afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|I {{listened to}} it and {{realized}} {{it was the perfect}} song for the middle of Sunday <b>Mornings</b> <b>because</b> Sunday <b>Mornings</b> needs to NOT be a record about redemption. It’s a record about struggling to get your shit together after you’ve wrecked your life; not necessarily a record about getting your shit together. But the songs are mostly very sad and very beautiful, especially in contrast to Saturday Nights, which can land you in the trap the song’s about. Sunday Mornings needed ‘You Can’t Count On Me’ for the same reason I needed to write ‘You Can’t Count On Me.’ ...|$|R

The body of this acquaintance, Lawrence Sharp, was discarded behind a Westminster gas station. His body was found the following day, and his autopsy revealed that, in addition to being bound and sodomized, Sharp had been extensively beaten about the face and body, then strangled with a ligature.|$|E
2500|$|Author Maya Angelou, {{known for}} her novel [...] "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", said on ABC's Good Morning America that the morning of King's death was a [...] "bleak morning {{for me and for}} many people and yet it's a great <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> {{we have a chance to}} look at her and see what she did and who she was. It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours. I mean African-Americans and white Americans and Asians, Spanish-speaking — she belonged to us and that's a great thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Istanbul's {{persistently}} high humidity reaches [...] most <b>mornings.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, fog is very common, {{although more}} so in northern {{parts of the city}} and away from the city center. Dense fog disrupts transportation in the region, including on the Bosphorus, and is common during the autumn and winter months when the humidity remains high into the afternoon. The humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate by midday during the summer months, but the lingering humidity exacerbates the moderately high summer temperatures. During these summer months, high temperatures average around [...] and rainfall is uncommon; there are only about fifteen days with measurable precipitation between June and August. The summer months also have the highest concentration of thunderstorms.|$|R
5000|$|After I {{had some}} success, Lee Strasberg {{tried to take}} credit for {{teaching}} me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He was an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday <b>mornings</b> <b>because</b> Elia Kazan was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls, but Strasberg never taught me acting. Stella (Adler) did—and later Kazan.|$|R
2500|$|Bridget Erin [...] "Beach" [...] Hennessy, {{portrayed by}} Kaley Cuoco, is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child. She is {{depicted}} as a stereotypical blonde, a popular bombshell who is preoccupied with her looks, teenaged boys, and little else. She sometimes displays intelligence or profundity, but these are initially few and far between, yet often poignant. Her favorite book is J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. After her father dies, she begins to steadily mature. Bridget initially felt guilty about Paul's death because the last words she ever spoke to him were [...] "I hate you" [...] after arguing with him earlier that <b>morning,</b> <b>because</b> he said no to her using the car. In season two, Bridget was revealed to have been conceived on a beach.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Chinese {{in other}} parts of Malaysia, Kelantanese Chinese prefer to conduct their wedding party at home rather than at a restaurant. This {{reflects}} their mindset that their presence to [...] celebrate the newly weds {{is more important than the}} wedding banquet. And also make it a gathering ceremony to celebrate the angsu 'red/ happiness'. the more guest mean the house owner is more respectable. This is further proven by their generosity of the money gifts from the newly weds. Usually the wedding ceremony begins on Thursday night and proceeds until the next <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> the weekend holiday is Friday in Kelantan. For good luck, the groom has to bring home the bride before 12 noon on the Friday with flowers decorate car.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{testimony}} {{was given by}} AWB financial secretary Kays Smit. Smit testified that Allan had phoned her to come and remove a drunken Terre'Blanche from her flat early one <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> Allan was expecting someone and was anxious {{to get rid of}} him. Smit testified to finding Terre'Blanche on Allan's couch [...] "naked except for a khaki jacket around his shoulders and a pair of underpants". Her description of Terre'Blanche's green underpants with holes in them became the source of much ridicule in the press. Additional testimony against Allan was given by former colleague Marlene Burger, who claimed Terre'Blanche had proposed to Allan in April 1989. According to Burger, Allan was thrilled and asked Burger to be her bridesmaid. Gray countered that the claims were [...] "utterly unfounded and wholly untrue".|$|E

2500|$|In an early-morning {{ceremony}} on May 10, 2014, the long-unidentified {{remains of}} 1,115 victims were {{transferred from the}} city medical examiner to Ground Zero, {{where they would be}} placed in a space in the bedrock [...] below ground as part of the 9/11 Museum. Reaction from the victims' families to the move was divided, with some supporting the decision and others calling the location inappropriate. Among the latter was FDNY Lt. James McCaffrey, the brother-in-law of 9/11 victim and firefighter Orio Palmer, who called a ground-level tomb a more dignified location: [...] "The decision to put the human remains of the 9/11 dead in this basement is inherently disrespectful and totally offensive." [...] McCaffrey said that the remains deserved a prominence equal to that of the Memorial's trees and pools, and that the ceremony was held early in the <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> of opposition to the decision.|$|E

Two hours later at 9 a.m. prime minister Edano learned the news. At a press-conference, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura revealed that Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yukio Edano sent a strong reprimand to Hiroyuki Fukano, the chief of NISA, because NISA failed to report the incident immediately to both himself and the Prime Minister's Office, and that NISA waited almost a day after the find was done. Fujimura said, [...] "I have been told that NISA decided not to report the incident until the following <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> the agency didn't believe it was a dangerous situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day last week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next <b>morning</b> <b>because</b> of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E
