Results indicate that temperature controls granulocyte counts and subsequently THC. Other environmental factors had no direct influence on the measured hemocyte parameters. Almost all measured parameters were significantly affected by size/age and condition index.

Nevertheless, high Perkinsus sp. infection intensity significantly increased total and granulocyte counts and decreased phagocytosis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{hydrophobic}} interaction on water is still controversial and requires more detailed experimental and theoretical investigation. The interaction between organic−water molecular complexes might {{be indicative of}} the perturbation of hydrogen-bond network in the tetrahedral structure of bulk waters, due to hydrophobic effect. In this contribution, femto/picosecond-resolved solvation dynamics techniques have been adopted to explore the dynamical modification of water clusters in hydrophobic solvent methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The dynamical evolution of water molecules at the surface of micelle-like MTBE has also been studied. Dynamic light scattering techniques have been employed to determine {{the size of the}} molecular clusters being formed in respective solvents. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy well measures the changes in O−H vibration frequency of water induced by MTBE.

However, if not properly controlled, thermal cracking in concrete, especially near water pipes, might occur, as experienced in many mass concrete structures. In this paper, a new numerical approach to simulate thermal cracking based on particle flow code is used to shed more light onto the process of thermal crack propagation {{and the effect of}} thermal cracks on thermal fields. Key details of the simulation, including the procedure of obtaining thermal and mechanical properties of particles, are presented. Importantly, a heat flow boundary based on an analytical solution is proposed and used in particle flow code in two dimensions to simulate the effect of pipe cooling. The simulation results are in good agreement with the <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> data and observations on cored specimens from a real concrete gravity dam, giving confidence to the appropriateness of the adopted simulation. The simulated results also clearly demonstrate why thermal cracks occur and how they propagate, as well as the influence of such cracks on thermal fields...|$|E

The evolution from free spherical micelles into an ordered material was studied with time-resolved in-situ SAXS, USAXS and SANS measurements.

From the time-resolved measurements the events {{taking place in the}} {{formation of}} SBA- 15 was identified and put on a time line. An additional step was found in the formation of plate-like particles, 7 smaller primary particles build up a larger secondary particle. The aggregation of primary particles was highly specific, an oriented aggregation. It was possible to hinder the oriented aggregation by diluting the synthesis reaction at a specific time. Moreover, a salt addition at this specific time give rise to particles with a very large diameter while the thickness was constant.

40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} are {{thanks to their}} advantageous volume properties and due to their relatively low price interesting for various applications. However, the possible use of common polymers is hampered by their low surface energy that leads to poor adhesion of subsequent coatings and limited ability to bind biomolecules. One of the strategies to increase the surface energy is modification of polymer surface by atmospheric plasma. In this study, we have investigated effect of atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge generated in air on poly(ether-ether-ketone). We estimated plasma composition by optical emission spectroscopy as well as <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> of the polymer during the treatment in order to verify applicability of this plasma source. Subsequently changes in morphology, chemical composition and surface energy of polymeric samples after the plasma treatment were determined. We proved that surface energy increases with increasing surface density of polar functional groups and that plasma causes changes in morphology of the studied polymer surface. We determined the etching rate of poly(ether-ether-ketone) in dependence on the supplied power. Optical properties remained unchanged indicating that also volume properties were not affected by plasma. Finally we tested the binding of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of an interleaved gradient-echo, echo-planar imaging (iGE-EPI) sequence for multiplanar magnetic resonance temperature imaging (MRTI) to monitor intracerebral thermal treatment three-dimensionally using multielement ultrasound applicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) fragments were injected into the right cerebral hemisphere of five dogs. Guided by MRI, an interstitial ultrasound applicator was inserted into the tumor or normal brain tissue. The iGE-EPI sequence was used to estimate temperature changes by computing the complex phase-difference induced by temperature-dependent shifts in the proton resonance frequency of water. The thermal dose maps were updated every 6 - 8 seconds for five to seven image planes during treatment. The results of MRTI were {{compared with those of}} post-treatment MRI and histologic analysis. RESULTS: The multiplanar MRTI <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> and thermal dose distributions in tumor and normal brain tissue over the entire user-defined treatment volume. The ultrasound applicators produced contiguous areas of coagulative necrosis, resulting in 1. 5 - 4. 0 cm(3) volumes of tissue necrosis. MRTI-based assessments of thermal-dose distributions were consistent with the results of post-treatment MRI and histologic analysis.

A total of 223 questionnaire responses along with <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> data and thermal comfort surveys from 30 rooms are used in this analysis.

The average indoor temperature of residents from warm climates was 2. 3 °C higher than that of residents from cool climates in February 2015 (winter heating season). This difference cannot be explained by room orientation alone.

The composite and the carbon steel were exposed in 0. 5 M NaOH and 0. 5 M HCl solutions as the control solutions. The Arecaceae extract from the fruit juice was added in volume percentages of 5 %v/v and 10 %v/v. The exposure time covered 12 days, and the <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> range during the exposure time was 25 - 39 °C.

In arid regions, the environmental temperature {{plays a major role in}} the performance of roof tiles. The temperature difference between the internal and external tile surfaces is one of the important parameters that control the characteristic of the thermal crack. This paper numerically investigates the thermal performance of concrete roof tiles widely used as roof covering material in Australia. A 3 -D finite element model of the roof tile was developed in ATENA software. The field <b>monitored</b> <b>temperature</b> data at the inner and outer surface of the tiles was used to analyse the thermal performance. Further, a parametric study was conducted to quantify the effect of material property and thermal loading. It was observed that the temperature difference between the inner and outer surface of the tile has the significant effect on the crack width, however the rate of cooling of the top surface does not have an effect on the crack width. Finally, a probabilistic crack width damage model was developed as a function of the temperature difference. This can be used to assess the vulnerability of concrete tile subjected to thermal load...|$|E
40|$|The {{service life}} of {{thick-walled}} power plant components exposed to creep, {{as is the}} case with pipelines of fresh- and re-heated steam, depend on the exhaustion rate of the material. Plant operation at elevated temperatures and at temperatures below designed temperatures all relates to the material exhaustion rate, thus complicating remaining life assessment, whereas the operating temperature variation is a most common cause in the mismatching of real service- and design life. Apart from temperature, the tube wall stress is a significant variable for remaining life assessment, whose calculation depends on the selected procedure, due to the complex pipeline configuration. In this paper, a remaining life assessment is performed according to the Larson-Miller parametric relation for a Ø 324 × 36 pipe bend element of a fresh steam-pipeline, made of steel class 1 Cr 0. 3 Mo 0. 25 V, after 160 000 hours of operation.
