5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} <b>material</b> causes changes in currents in other parts of the <b>material,</b> the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the <b>material.</b>|$|E

This suggests that interesting <b>material,</b> even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting <b>material.</b>|$|E

There are three closely connected areas of study related to <b>materials,</b> namely <b>material(s)</b> technology, <b>materials</b> engineering and <b>materials</b> science. <b>Material(s)</b> technology is a relatively comprehensive discipline that begins with the production of goods from raw <b>materials</b> to processing of <b>materials</b> into the shapes and forms needed for specific applications. <b>Material(s)</b> technologists work with <b>materials</b> such as metals, plastics, rubbers and ceramics.

5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized <b>material</b> performed better that students given organized <b>material</b> on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core <b>material</b> is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the <b>material</b> and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional <b>material.</b> Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of <b>material</b> in both verbal and nonverbal systems.

30|$|<b>Materials</b> {{science is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} field with the broad objectives {{of understanding the}} structure and properties of <b>materials</b> and the discovery of new <b>materials.</b> In his historical account of this field titled The Coming of <b>Materials</b> Science (Cahn et al. 2003), R. W. Cahn referred {{to the middle of}} the past century as the time <b>materials</b> science was born out of metallurgy. <b>Materials</b> science has expanded since then to cover the science of ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and numerous functional <b>materials.</b> Since the inception of <b>materials</b> science, experiment has been a central theme underlying investigation of the structure and properties of <b>materials</b> while modelling was aimed initially at the interpretation of experimental results. However, with the need to understand increasingly complex <b>materials</b> structures and the connection of <b>materials</b> structure with <b>materials</b> behaviour, advanced theoretical concepts from the fields of physics, chemistry, mechanics, applied mathematics, and statistics were introduced. Thus, the development of rigorous models for <b>materials</b> structure, <b>materials</b> defects, microstructure evolution, and the behaviour of <b>materials</b> became a second thrust of <b>materials</b> science. Over the past three decades, the theory of <b>materials</b> has worked hand in hand with experiments to interpret results and to explore <b>materials</b> behaviour under conditions that at present cannot be probed directly by experiments. Concurrently, <b>materials</b> research began to exploit the rapidly increasing power of computers to solve theoretical models and to generate structural and property related data through simulations. This in turn enabled <b>materials</b> discovery for applications, including batteries (Liu et al. 2015) and structural <b>materials</b> (Schmitz et al. 2011). The availability of advanced simulation tools capable of predicting the structure and behaviour of <b>materials</b> over varying length and time scales and the possibility of integrating such tools into <b>materials</b> design marked the coming of integrated computational <b>materials</b> engineering (ICME) (Integrated Computational <b>Materials</b> Engineering: A Transformational Discipline for Improved Competitiveness and National Security et al. 2008), an approach integrating simulation tools at all relevant scales for the concurrent design of <b>materials,</b> processes, and products. Furthermore, the quest for accelerated <b>materials</b> discovery has ushered in the era of the <b>materials</b> genome (MG), where experiments, computational tools, and big data (<b>Materials</b> Genome Initiative Strategic et al. 2014) are combined to accelerate <b>materials</b> discovery. Advances in computing, data acquisition, and the discovery and design of <b>materials</b> have also led to the application of the principles of informatics to <b>materials</b> (Rajan 2005), whereby information based on the structure and property of <b>materials</b> and their connections are surveyed to enable MG- and ICME-type efforts.|$|R
