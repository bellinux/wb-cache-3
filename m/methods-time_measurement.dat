50|$|A {{predetermined}} motion {{time system}} (PMTS) is frequently {{used to set}} labor rates in labour oriented industry by quantifying {{the amount of time}} required to perform specific tasks. The first such system is known as <b>Methods-time</b> <b>measurement,</b> released in 1948 and today existing in several variations, commonly known as MTM-1, MTM-2, MTM-UAS, MTM-MEK and MTM-B. Obsolete MTM standards include MTM-3 and MMMM (4M). The MTM-2 standard has also largely been phased out by the organization, but is still used in some commercial applications. Predetermined motion time system is another term to describe Predetermined Time standards (PTS).|$|E
50|$|Overall {{equipment}} effectiveness (OEE) {{is a set}} {{of performance}} metrics that fit well in a lean environment. Also, PMTS, <b>methods-time</b> <b>measurement,</b> cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and IT effectiveness in the operational processes. For example, Jun-Ing Ker and Yichuan Wang analyze two prescribing technologies, namely no carbon required (NCR) and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering, transcribing, and dispensing process in a multi-hospital health system. With comparison between these two technologies,the statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology. The results indicated a reduction of 54.5% in queue time, 32.4% in order entry time, 76.9% in outgoing delay time, and 67.7% in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology.|$|E

The Working Paper 14 {{focuses on a}} specific feature of buying behaviour in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize labour cost. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined {{against the backdrop of}} ongoing wage defaulting and import price deflation in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using Predetermined Time standards (PTS), Predetermined motion time system (PMTS); is highly technical and ‘synthetic’. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies. In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in <b>methods-time</b> <b>measurement</b> (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector- the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards (MODAPTS), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd. All three forms of work measurement for arriving at a standard time should normally make provision for relaxation, contingency and special allowances.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to provide decision support to assembly line planners when they perform assembly time estimations. There is a lack of consistency in the assembly time analysis performed by planners. The decision support system that was developed in this research is based on mapping controlled language assembly work instructions to <b>Methods-Time</b> <b>Measurement</b> (MTM) tables. Automated analysis of historical work instructions and their related time study analysis were performed by employing knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) algorithms through the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) interface. As a result of this automated analysis, forty-six mapping rules were created that related work instructions to MTM tables and the data backbone for the decision support system that was created. Analyzing large sets of historical data is crucial while creating decision support systems. KDD provides a sustainable method of analyzing big data. Future work of this research includes applying the KDD process to create data backbones for decision support systems to aid in ergonomic evaluations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{developments of}} traditional value stream mapping (VSM) related to enhancing system and method competencies of both individuals and organisations. Since systematic immersions in traditional VSM – a highly accepted technique for improving production systems – are necessary, {{this paper describes}} from a production research point of view approaches for systematic productivity increases, reduction of lead time and an approach to improve sustainability indicators of value streams. The introduced developments of VSM focus on the entire flow and on details, thus creating synergies for designing and improving value streams, processes and work systems both economically and ecologically. On the one hand, this paper shows how practical approaches respectively rationalisation concepts (Lean principles, VSM, Process Management, short-cyclic improvement routine, <b>Methods-Time</b> <b>Measurement)</b> are used in industry in order to manage and improve processes and value streams. On the other hand, sustainability management can be supported on shop floor with utilisation of VSM.

3000|$|Data {{collection}} {{through time}} and motion study To assign {{the cost to}} the in-store replenishment processes described in the previous section, we conducted a {{time and motion study}} for a German grocery retailer. Stock clerks were accompanied to identify the different steps involved in the in-store replenishment process. To do so, we made use of the <b>methods-time</b> <b>measurement</b> concept (Maynard et al. 1948). Following Barnes (1949) and Niebel (1988), we analyzed the replenishment process systematically by first identifying subprocesses and the most efficient way of executing them, then categorizing and standardizing the subprocesses identified, and ultimately determining the standard time required by a qualified stock clerk to execute each subprocess. To level the effects of potential outliers in observed process times due to factors such as time, staff capability or store location, we measured the process times across two stores on all weekdays and for various employees. Product groups were from the ambient assortment, including both fast- and slow-movers. The division into subprocesses was as granular as possible to accurately differentiate between constant and variable elements (Barnes 1949). Process mapping was used to detect potential process improvements, but also to calculate the standard time required for a task.|$|E
40|$|AbstractManufacturing {{companies}} are progressively applying digital manufacturing tools {{to respond to}} increased product complexity in shortened product lifecycles. The application results in a comprehensive documentation of the product emergence process. Furthermore at Daimler, a controlled natural language has recently been established, which enables automated analysis of natural language work task description texts. This work proposes a methodology, which enhances planning efficiency by automatically presenting a set of potentially suitable work plans for novel products. The presented work plans are reused from past planning activities. Assessment of work plan suitability {{is based on a}} statistical analysis that employs <b>Methods-Time</b> <b>Measurement</b> (MTM) data as well as work task descriptions in a controlled natural language (cnl). The proposed methodology is compared to a previously presented approach, in which text mining is used instead of a controlled natural language. The test comprises 104 work tasks of a Daimler assembly line. While result quality is only slightly improved for the cnl based approach, mapping results from product clusters to assembly sequences are simplified and analysis effort can be reduced if a cnl is already established. Future investigations should focus on investigations of applicability to different production and assembly domains...|$|E

40|$|The {{preventive}} {{knowledge of}} serviceability times {{is a critical}} factor for the quantification of after-sales services costs of a vehicle. Predetermined Motion Time System (PMTS) are frequently used to set labor rates in industry by quantifying {{the amount of time}} required to perform specific tasks. The first such system is known as <b>Methods-time</b> <b>measurement</b> (MTM). Several variants of MTM have been developed differing from each other on their level of focus. Among them MTM-UAS is suitable for processes that average around 1 to 3 minutes. However experimental tests carried out by the authors in Elasis (Research Center of FIAT Group) demonstrate that MTM-UAS is not the optimal approach to measure serviceability times. The reason is that it doesn’t take into account ergonomic factors. In the present paper the authors propose to correct the MTM-UAS method including in the task analysis the study of human postures and efforts. The proposed approach allows to estimate with an “acceptable” error the time needed to perform maintenance tasks since the first phases of product design, by working on Digital Mock-up and human models in virtual environment. As a byproduct of that analysis, it is possible to obtain a list of maintenance times in order to preventively set after-sales service costs...|$|E
40|$|A biomechanical {{model is}} presented, and {{combined}} with measurements of tip press force, to estimate total user hand force associated with two pneumatic nail gun trigger systems. The contact actuation trigger (CAT) can fire a nail when the user holds the trigger depressed {{first and then}} "bumps" the nail gun tip against the workpiece. With a full sequential actuation trigger (SAT) the user must press the tip against the workpiece prior to activating the trigger. The SAT is demonstrably safer in reducing traumatic injury risk, but increases the duration (and magnitude) of tip force exertion. Time integrated (cumulative) hand force was calculated for a single user from measurements of the tip contact force with the workpiece and transfer time between nails as inputs to a static model of the nail gun and workpiece in two nailing task orientations. The model shows the hand force dependence upon {{the orientation of the}} workpiece in addition to the trigger system. Based on standard time allowances from work measurement systems (i. e. <b>Methods-Time</b> <b>Measurement</b> - 1) it is proposed that efficient application of hand force with the SAT in maintaining tip contact can reduce force exertion attributable to the sequential actuation trigger to 2 - 8 % (horizontal nailing) and 9 - 20 % (vertical nailing) of the total hand/arm force. The present model is useful for considering differences in cumulative hand/arm force exposure between the SAT and CAT systems and may explain the appeal of the CAT trigger in reducing the user's perception of muscular effort.
