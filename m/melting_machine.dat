Through a gracious donation made by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California Polytechnic State University received and installed an SLM 125 HL selective laser <b>melting</b> <b>machine</b> in February 2017. As part of the initial setup effort, a preliminary machine verification study was conducted to evaluate the general print quality of the machine with default parameter settings.

A diverse set of components were printed on the SLM 125 HL to determine the procedural best practices and inherent constraints. Additionally, the mode and mechanism of failure for a defective Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory component fabricated at their facility was investigated.

Being a fast, flexible and clean method, it is superior to other techniques such as ink-marking, mechanical engraving and electro-chemical methods.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is {{a manufacturing}} technique that typically builds parts layer by layer, for example, {{in the case}} of selective laser melted (SLM) material by fusing layers of metal powder. This allows the construction of complex geometry parts, which, in some cases cannot be made by traditional manufacturing routes. Complex parts can be difficult to inspect for material conformity and defects which are limiting widespread adoption especially in high performance arenas. Spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy (SRAS) is a technique for material characterisation based on robustly measuring the surface acoustic wave velocity. Here the SRAS technique is applied to prepare additively manufactured material to measure the material properties and identify defects.

40|$|The key barrier {{for many}} {{industries}} in adopting additive manufacturing technologies {{is the lack}} of quality assurance and repeatability. Defect/porosity analysis is the most important inspection step for any additively manufactured components. This paper presents a method for the detection of defects/porosity in additive manufactured components using computer tomography. A Nikon XTH 225 industrial CT was used to analyse the relative size and location of the defects and assess the capability of the inspection process based on different levels of X-ray detector magnification. To reduce the number of process variables, all the measurement process parameters, such as filament current, acceleration voltage and X-ray filtering material and thickness, are kept constant.

To reduce the number of process variables, all participants utilise a Nikon XCT machine, either an XT H 225 industrial CT or an MCT 225 metrology CT.

This project’s purpose was to look for alternative manufacturing methods that could {{speed up the process}} and enhance the experience for the patient for example make some personal design or make the socket lighter. The main goal was to investigate which properties could be achieved by applying Electron Beam Melting as an alternative {{manufacturing process}} for prosthetic sockets by applying an earlier developed methodology. An investigation of earlier scientific works with the keywords (additive manufacturing, free form fabrication, orthopedic, prosthetic sockets and rapid manufacturing) was done as well as gathering knowledge how to operate and handle the machines necessary to carry out the project. An updated version of the methodology was developed where the design was verified using finite element analysis. With the updated version the methodology contained nine steps, which in short was as follows. First apprehend an inner socket from an orthopedic clinic with a pattern drawn up on it, the pattern is then transferred to a computer environment and manipulated to the desired shape and thickness. A compressive strength test, both virtual and experimental, was designed by {{a modified version of the}} ISO- 10328 standard and the virtual design was verified before the socket was manufactured in the Electron Beam <b>Melting</b> <b>machine.</b> The manufactured socket was tested in the experimental set-up to verify the virtual one.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{measured}} the corrosion properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts produced with Electron Beam <b>Melting</b> <b>machine</b> (EBM). Potentiodynamic and potentiostatic tests were applied on EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution, {{to determine the}} pitting potential and critical pitting temperature (CPT). A relation between pitting potential and temperature was established for EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy by conducting potentiodynamic test under different temperatures from room temperature until 83 ?C. Critical pitting temperature was also measured in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution of different pH of 2. 0, 5. 7 and 10. 0, to {{examine the effect of}} aggressive conditions on the pitting corrosion of EBM alloy. Moreover, the same tests were performed on wrought Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for comparison purposes. The results showed that EBM alloy maintained its corrosion resistance as it had the same pitting potential of wrought alloy even at higher temperatures. EBM alloy did not pit when performing potentiostatic test at 800 mV vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) even under different pH of the solution. Due to the manufacturing technique and conditions of the EBM machine, the resulted object has irregularities on the exterior surface and voids that are formed within the part which affects samples? properties like surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity. In this study, a statistically designed experiment was employed to manufacture Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples in EBM machine under different process parameters of beam current, beam speed and offset focus. Surface roughness was measured for as-built samples. Then, a potentiostatic test was conducted under 2. 40 V vs. SCE to determine the critical pitting temperature in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution for the same samples of different processing parameters. Moreover, density was measured and porosity was calculated from density values. Finally, a model equation was established in order to relate EBM?s process parameters to measured properties of surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity. It was noted that offset focus had the main influence on surface roughness more than beam current and beam speed. Changing processing parameters did not affect corrosion behavior of EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V as CPT did not vary widely, with a slight effect obtained from beam current and beam speed. Density and porosity were greatly affected with offset focus more than the other parameters. It can be concluded that uniform and precise roughness and porosity are not achievable through this machine, only a range of these properties can be attained...|$|E

50|$|In {{cities where}} snow {{steadily}} accumulates {{over the winter}} it is also necessary to remove the piles of snow that build up {{on the side of}} the roads known as windrows or snowbanks. There are a number of methods of doing this. Pulling snow is done when temperatures rise high enough for traffic to melt snow. The windrows are then broken up and spread over the road. Casting is the moving of snow by means of a shovel or plow to nearby public lands. On boulevards or highways winging back is done, which consists of pushing the snow banks further from the road. The most expensive option, but necessary when there are no nearby places to dump the snow, is to haul it away. This is most often done by large self-propelled snowblowers that gather the piles of snow at the side of the road and load it into dump trucks. The snow is then dumped on the outskirts of town, or in a nearby lake, river or harbor. (Some jurisdictions have banned dumping snow into local bodies of water for environmental reasons - modern roads can be contaminated with melting salt, motor oil, and other substances.) Snow <b>melting</b> <b>machines</b> may be cheaper than moving snow, depending on the cost of fuel and the ambient temperature.|$|R

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a research carried out into the introduction of an environmental management system (EMS) into an aluminium alloy foundry. The foundry, classified as a small and medium sized enterprise (SME), produces aluminium alloy castings by sand and gravity die casting processes. Its principal activities are the production of wood patterns, sand moulding, <b>melting,</b> <b>machining</b> and fettling processes. The company faces environmental pressure from government, customers and the local community. Manufacturing activities and products consume non-renewable resources and produce wastes, discharges and emissions. One way to manage those pressures and impacts is to introduce an environmental management system. The research investigates the environmental performance and impacts on a UK SME namely Hadleigh Castings Ltd, of the existing and future environmental legislation and taxation applied to the aluminium foundry, and the steps taken to introduce the EMS. These steps include policy formulation, assessment of environmental impacts, planning the environmental programme, implementation of procedures, manual, training, projects and audit to the final step of EMS review. The analysis highlights the benefits and problems arising from the introduction of an EMS. The commitment of resources was strongly dependent on external economic pressures. The preparatory review revealed non-compliance issues, which required solutions before implementation of the EMS could proceed. Achieving management commitment to change proved problematic {{in the face of}} production priorities and traditional attitudes. However, a number of benefits were identified. These included an increase in employees' awareness of environmental issues, improved working practices, the initiation of cultural change through better management and assignment of responsibility and an improved relationship with regulators...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the novel application of microwave {{technology to the}} process of additive layer manufacturing (ALM). A particle size sensor, based on microwave cavity perturbation, is described and subsequently demonstrated by the measurement of the complex permeability of a series of Titanium powders. The results are compared with existing theory and finite element simulations of metallic powders. The ability to discern changing particle size distributions is important in ensuring the reliable operation of selective laser <b>melting</b> <b>machines</b> but, to remain industrially relevant, it is vital that the proposed system can be produced at low cost. By way of demonstration, the design and construction of an inexpensive scalar network analyser was completed. A systematic study of surface resistance of a number of metal surfaces, produced by Selective Laser Melting, was undertaken. Using a dielectric resonator with a “lift-off” calibration procedure, the losses of surfaces manufactured in orthogonal orientations and different surface finishes were compared. Surface roughness measurements showed that microwave losses were not monotonically dependent on root-mean-square surface roughness; this was attributed to differing roughness feature size distributions. For microwave characterization of materials over a wide temperature range, it is often desirable to perform cavity perturbation measurements at elevated temperatures. However, it is shown here that heat treatment can permanently modify the surface resistance of a metal surface and potentially lead to inaccurate perturbation results. X-Ray diffraction measurements confirm the source of modification is due to changes in surface stress and the appearance of solution precipitates. The sensitivity of microwave measurements to surface stress also demonstrates the potential for microwave assessment of surfaces produced by ALM. Finally, to stimulate further work in this area, the design of a single mode microwave heating system was discussed and a prototype developed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Solid {{solution}} alloying {{was employed}} {{in an attempt}} to produce some relatively ductile form of beryllium. If the c/a ratio could be significantly altered, it was felt new or different slip systems could be activated. The following elements were {{selected on the basis of}} atomic size, melting point, crystal structure and density for adding to beryllium in amounts of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 atomic percentages: boron, manganese and, titanium. All samples were non-consumable arc <b>melted,</b> <b>machined</b> and sectioned for wet chemical, spectrographic, X-ray diffraction and metal-lographic analysis as well as for mechanical (compression) testing. These tests showed all alloy samples exceeded the solubility limits in each respective system. Be₄₋₅B, Be₈Mn and Be₁₂Ti were identified as the second phases in the individual systems. Beryllium-boron alloys exhibited an eutectic or peritectic reaction and the eutectic composition in the beryllium-manganese system was established at 22. 0 weight percent manganese. The samples Be / 0. 5 B, Be / 1. 0 Mn and Be / 0. 5 Ti gave yield strengths of 47, 200 psi, 56, 600 psi and 81, 250 psi respectively in compression testing. These same specimens yielded work hardening rates of 1. 07 x 10 ⁶ psi, 1. 3 x 10 ⁶ psi and 1. 52 x 10 ⁶ psi respectively. Long wide twins in pure beryllium were accompanied by large amounts of cross-slip. The boron sample displayed long wide twins and also very short narrow twins, no cross-slip and extensive areas with microcracks present. Shorter and narrower twins characterize the manganese specimens. The beryllium-titanium alloys exhibited extremely small twins emanating from particles of second phase Be₁₂Ti; however, the majority of the twins in this system are long, extremely narrow and are seen to be internally constricted along the length of the twin. These constrictions have been ascribed to a strain relief process which further prevented the twin from growing parallel to its shorter dimension. The near total absence of cross-slip in the three alloy systems was attributed to a lessening of the stacking fault energy as a result of increasing the solute concentration. The drop in the stacking fault energy decreases the probability for cross-slip, makes extensive deformation difficult and explains higher yield strengths and work hardening rates. Evidence presented suggests slip occurs prior to gross twin propagation. The relationship between twinning shear and twin shape suggests for the beryllium-titanium alloys twinning on higher order planes (e. g.,. 1121 or 11122) rather than the 1012 twinning normally observed...|$|R

The possibility of producing complex and individually modified components as well as prototypes gives additive manufacturing a substantial advantage over conventional subtractive machining. One of the current barriers for most industries in implementing AM {{is the lack of}} build repeatability and a deficit in quality assurance standards. The mechanical properties of the components depend critically on the density achieved therefore defect/porosity analysis must be carried out to verify the components’ integrity and viability. This paper presents a methodology for differentiating between unmelted powder and defects/pores in additive manufactured components using computer tomography thus allowing the detection of pores even when they are “filled” with unmelted powder. The powder used was Ti 6 AL 4 V with a grain size of 45 - 100 µm, typically employed with Arcam electron beam <b>melting</b> (EBM) <b>machines.</b> The samples consisted of a plastic test tube filled with powder and a known volume small plastic particles that were placed inside acting as pores/defects.

The limits of the angles from the horizontal that elements could be built are reviewed and scanning techniques are developed that create elements below these values. In order to create horizontal links significant proportions of the machine control software were replaced with software developed {{during the course of the}} research. This is discussed at length along with how the limitations on the number of processing parameters available could be removed and how pauses which let sections of the melt on horizontal links freeze before processing the next section could be used. It is suggested that systems or experimental set ups are developed that allow greater control over the duration of these pauses. This would enable further research into the processing of horizontal links, developing them to the point where they are mechanically consistent and comparable to other links in the structuresEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The micro-EDM is a {{well-established}} subtractive type of micro-manufacturing process {{and has been}} at the center of research for the last 15 years. The laser induced plasma micro-machining (LIP-MM) is a novel multimaterial and tool-less micro-machining process that also removes material through plasma. Since, both processes remove material through <b>melting</b> and vaporization, <b>machining</b> is always accompanied with heat affected zone. Since different materials have different thermo-physical properties, the plasma discharge energy level for minimal HAZ is material-dependent. The plasma discharge energy level corresponding to minimal HAZ can be experimentally determined by examining the dependence of the spatial distribution of the transient temperature response near the machined zone on the energy level. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation on real time measurement of the transient temperature response during single discharge machining at different pulse energy levels by the micro-EDM and the LIP-MM processes. The experimental data establishes a relationship between the pulse energy level and the transient temperature response and thus can be used for identifying the conditions for minimal HAZ in the two processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} produce serial parts via {{additive}} layer manufacturing, the fatigue performance can be a critical attribute. In this paper, the microstructure, high cycle fatigue (HCF), and fracture behavior of additive manufactured AlSi 10 Mg samples are investigated. The samples were manufactured by a particular powder-bed process called Selective Laser <b>Melting</b> (SLM) and <b>machined</b> afterwards. 91 samples were manufactured without (30 °C) and with heating (300 °C) of the building platform and in different directions (0 °, 45 °, 90 °). Samples were tested in the peak-hardened (T 6) and as-built condition. The Wöhler curves were interpolated by a Weibull distribution. The results were analysed statistically by design of experiments, correlation analysis, and marginal means plots. The investigations show that the post heat treatment has the most considerable effect and the building direction has the least considerable effect on the fatigue resistance. The fatigue resistance of the sampl es, however, is high {{in comparison to the}} standard DIN EN 1706. The combination of 300 °C platform heating and peak-hardening is a valuable approach to increase the fatigue resistance and neutralize the differences in fatigue life for the 0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° directions...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{is making}} space {{exploration}} more affordable and viable by developing and utilizing innovative manufacturing technologies. Technology development efforts at NASA in propulsion {{are committed to}} continuous innovation of design and manufacturing technologies for rocket engines {{in order to reduce}} the cost of NASA's journey to Mars. The Low Cost Upper Stage-Class Propulsion (LCUSP) effort will develop and utilize emerging Additive Manufacturing (AM) to significantly reduce the development time and cost for complex rocket propulsion hardware. Benefit of Additive Manufacturing (3 -D Printing) Current rocket propulsion manufacturing techniques are costly and have lengthy development times. In order to fabricate rocket engines, numerous complex parts made of different materials are assembled in a way that allow the propellant to collect heat at the right places to drive the turbopump and simultaneously keep the thrust chamber from melting. The heat conditioned fuel and oxidizer come together and burn inside the combustion chamber to provide thrust. The efforts to make multiple parts precisely fit together and not leak after experiencing cryogenic temperatures on one-side and combustion temperatures on the other is quite challenging. Additive manufacturing has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost of making rocket parts like the copper liner and Nickel-alloy jackets found in rocket combustion chambers where super-cold cryogenic propellants are heated and mixed to the extreme temperatures needed to propel rockets in space. The Selective Laser <b>Melting</b> (SLM) <b>machine</b> fuses 8, 255 layers of copper powder to make a section of the chamber in 10 days. Machining an equivalent part and assembling it with welding and brazing techniques could take months to accomplish with potential failures or leaks that could require fixes. The design process is also enhanced since it does not require the 3 D model to be converted to 2 -D drawings. The design and fabrication process can be sped up and improved with fewer errors to be accomplished in weeks instead of months...|$|R
