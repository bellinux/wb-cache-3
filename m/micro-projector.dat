40|$|We {{present a}} {{hand-held}} system for real-time, interactive acquisition of residential floor plans. The system integrates a commodity range camera, a <b>micro-projector,</b> and a button interface for user input {{and allows the}} user to freely move through a building to capture its important architectural elements. The system uses the Manhattan world assumption, which posits that wall layouts are rectilinear. This assumption allows generating floor plans in real time, enabling the operator to interactively guide the reconstruction process and to resolve structural ambiguities and errors during the acquisition. The interactive component aids users with no architectural training in acquiring wall layouts for their residences. We show a number of residential floor plans reconstructed with the system...|$|E
40|$|We present Bonfire, a {{self-contained}} mobile computing system that uses two laptop-mounted laser micro-projectors to project an interactive display space {{to either side}} of a laptop keyboard. Coupled with each <b>micro-projector</b> is a camera to enable hand gesture tracking, object recognition, and information transfer within the projected space. Thus, Bonfire is neither a pure laptop system nor a pure tabletop system, but an integration of the two into one new nomadic computing platform. This integration (1) enables observing the periphery and responding appropriately, e. g., to the casual placement of objects within its field of view, (2) enables integration between physical and digital objects via computer vision, (3) provides a horizontal surface in tandem with the usual vertical laptop display, allowing direct pointing and gestures, and (4) enlarges the input/output space to enrich existing applications. We describe Bonfire’s architecture, and offer scenarios that highlight Bonfire’s advantages. We also include lessons learned and insights for further development and use.

5000|$|Jem and the Holograms (1985 {{television}} series), Jerrica Benton, {{the lead}} singer of a band uses hologram projections to help create her alter-ego persona, Jem; <b>micro-projectors</b> in her earrings allow her to project a hologram over herself and produce hologram objects and images in her surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{revolves}} around Jem, the mysterious {{lead singer of}} the rock group [...] "Jem and the Holograms". Her real name is Jerrica Benton, and under this name she is the owner and manager of Starlight Music. Jerrica adopts this persona {{with the help of}} a holographic computer, known as Synergy, which was built by Jerrica's father to be [...] "the ultimate audio-visual entertainment synthesizer" [...] and is bequeathed to her after his death. Jerrica is able to command Synergy to project [...] "the Jem hologram" [...] over herself by means of the remote <b>micro-projectors</b> in her earrings, thus disguising her features and clothing, enabling her to assume the Jem persona. While disguised as Jem, Jerrica is able to move freely without restrictions and on several occasions other people have been in direct physical contact with her without disrupting the holographic projection. Jem, through the use of her earrings, is also able to project holograms around her and uses this ability throughout the series to avoid danger and provide special effects for the performances of her group.|$|R
40|$|Moving micro-mechanical {{structures}} {{combined with}} laser light sources and micro-optics enable {{a number of}} powerful applications in display, imaging, and spectroscopy. Examples of systems developed in our laboratory are: rotational scanners developed for <b>micro-projectors,</b> dynamic diffraction gratings with large out-of-plane motion developed for Fourier Transform spectrometers, and 2 degree-of-freedom MEMS stages that carry micro-lens arrays for laser beam steering and imaging applications. Precise control of motion is critical in all those applications. We developed a number of optical characterization tools for point-based and full-field dynamic characterization of micro and nano mechanical structures. In this paper, we first briefly discuss the applications and then describe {{the details of the}} optical characterization tools. First setup is a stroboscopic interferometry for dynamic deformation analysis. Second setup is a simple technique for simultaneous in-plane and out-of-plane measurement with nanometric precision. The setup is constructed using one photo detector and a Mirau-type interference objective. For out-of-plane measurements, interference fringes are used to compute the the deflection amount. For in-plane measurements, knife edge technique is used to modulate the reflected beam intensity using a sharp edge in the object. Third setup is a simple optical angle sensor for rotational mirrors, which uses only one bi-cell photo detector. The setup is able to measure amplitude, phase, and quality factor of torsional devices...|$|R
30|$|Visual stimuli were {{programmed}} using custom-written software {{based on}} MATLAB (Mathworks) and the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) and {{presented with a}} <b>micro-projector</b> (ASK). A colored filter {{directly in front of}} the display was used to block green light, in order to prevent interference with the fluorescence emission of GCaMP-HS. To measure the spatial RF, a pseudo random sequence of single black squares (4 × 10 °) was presented for 0.2 s with an interval of 0.2 s. To measure size tuning, the black dot of various sizes that were compensated for constant visual angles was moving at a speed of 30 °/s. To measure direction selectivity, the black bar was 10 ° in width and moving at a speed of 30 °/s, in eight directions evenly spanning 360 °. To measure motion sensitivity, the black dot in 10 ° was moving at a speed of 30 °/s, in four directions evenly spanning 360 °. To measure sustained response to motion, the black dot in 10 ° was moving at a speed of 30 °/s into the RF, rotating in a series of 5 speeds from 10 to 90 °/s. To measure visual adaptation, whole-field dimming pair with a series of 5 intervals from 1 s to 9 s was presented for 0.5 s, respectively. To measure escape, looming stimulation was presented with a black circle appearing, smoothly expanding at a speed of 5.4 cm/s and finally covering the whole screen. Diming stimulation with 0.4 s duration was presented. All stimuli were presented on white background.|$|E
40|$|Portable {{information}} devices demand displays {{with high}} resolution and high image quality that are increasingly compact and energy-efficient. Microdisplays {{consisting of a}} silicon CMOS backplane integrated with light generating or modifying devices, are being developed for direct-view and projection applications. A microdisplay architecture using silicon light emitters and image intensification suitable for a <b>micro-projector</b> application is developed. A standard low-voltage CMOS IC incorporating display drivers {{and an array of}} avalanche diodes produces a faint optical image, and an image intensifier efficiently amplifies the image to useful brightness. This architecture has high efficiency and the potential to achieve adequate luminance for projection applications. A proof-of-concept system with 16 x 32 arrays is implemented and evaluated. A high-performance silicon backplane for the above system is designed, implemented, and evaluated. The backplane is a standard CMOS die including a 360 x 200 pixel array with silicon light emitters, and 10 b precision current-mode driver circuits. The driver circuits can support a number of emissive display technologies including silicon light emitters and organic light emitting diode (OLED). (cont.) They employ a self-calibration technique based on the current copier circuit to minimize variation and fixed-pattern noise while reducing circuit area by a factor of five to seven compared to a conventional solution. A circuit technique to improve the retention time of dynamic analog memories is also presented. This technique allows a dynamic analog memory to retain 10 b precision for 500 ms at room temperature. by Andrew Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the working principle, design, and fabrication of a silicon-based scanning micromirror {{with a new}} type of action mechanism as an example of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems). Micromirrors can be found in barcode readers as well as <b>micro-projectors,</b> optical coherence tomography, or spectrometers’ adjustable filters. The fabrication process of the device prompted us to describe and discuss the problems related to the manufacture of MEMS. The article starts with some terminology and a brief introduction to the field of microsystems. Afterwards, the concept of a new scanning micromirror is explained. The device is operated by two pairs of thermal bimorphs. A special design enables to maintain a constant distance {{from the center of the}} mirror to the light source during the scanning process. The device was implemented in a one degree-of-freedom micromirror and a two degree-of-freedom micromirror. The fabrication process of both types is described. For each case, a different type of substrate was used. The first type of substrate was a standard silicon wafer; the second one, SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator). The process with the first one was complicated and caused many problems. Replacing this substrate with SOI solved some of the issues, but did not prevent new ones from arising. Nevertheless, the SOI substrate produces much better results and it is preferable to manufacture this type of MEMS devices...|$|R
