The hour that alcohol could be served until was pushed back to 10pm (unless the client was lodging for the night). It was forbidden to serve alcohol in the bedrooms of said establishments. A ban on gambling and smoking was added. Soldiers, valets and domestic servants could not drink in a Cabaret without written permission from their employers. The modifications also made it so that cabarets became a cash only business by refusing cabaret owners the right to extend credit or accept any other form of payment. Finally, the sale and service of alcohol for immediate drink became reserved to Cabaret owners and the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> that could be sold by other merchants for take home purposes was clearly defined.|$|E
50|$|Before 1973 Lilly {{adopted a}} {{marketing}} program {{known as the}} Cephalosporin Savings Plan (CSP), designed to make its cephalosporins more competitive with other antibiotics. The CSP provided that a rebate {{in the form of}} Lilly merchandise would be paid to hospitals based on the total amount of Lilly cephalosporins that they purchased. This suit concerned the 1975 version of the CSP, which Lilly adopted in response to competition. Under the 1975 CSP, Lilly gave hospitals an additional 3% rebate based on the purchases of specified <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> of any three of Lilly's five cephalosporins. SKC sold only two cephalosporins—Ancef and Anspor (cephradine). Lilly dominated the cephalosporin market with its sales of Keflin and Keflex, but its Kefzol and SKC's Ancef were in direct competition with comparable sales. Kefzol and Ancef are nearly therapeutically equivalent to Keflin but they command lower market prices because Lilly has a patent monopoly on Keflin; by the same token, profits on Keflin are far higher than on Kefzol. The sales of Kefzol and Ancef were growing at the expense of Keflin sales.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variant of}} the generalized assignment problem (GAP) where the amount of space used in each bin is restricted to be either zero (if the bin is not opened) or above a given lower bound (a minimum quantity). We provide several complexity results for different versions of the problem and give polynomial time exact algorithms and approximation algorithms for restricted cases. For the most general version of the problem, we show that it does not admit a polynomial time approximation algorithm (unless P=NP), even for the case of a single bin. This motivates to study dual approximation algorithms that compute solutions violating the bin capacities and <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> by a constant factor. When the number of bins is fixed and the minimum quantity of each bin is at least a factor δ> 1 larger than the largest size of an item in the bin, we show how to obtain a polynomial time dual approximation algorithm that computes a solution violating the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> and bin capacities by at most a factor 1 - 1 /δ and 1 + 1 /δ, respectively, and whose profit is at least as large as the profit of the best solution that satisfies the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> and bin capacities strictly.

40|$|Water supply {{services}} are Services of General Interest (SGI), subject to specific public service obligations, such as universality, continuity, quality, affordability, transparency, and consumer protection. There is an extensive empirical {{literature on the}} design of optimal prices. However, these contributions tend to neglect the issue of universal service and equity concerning the volume of water for basic needs (the ‘essential minimum quantity’). Addressing this gap in the literature, and using empirical data for the Portuguese municipalities, this paper aims to evaluate whether income-related equity considerations are embodied in water supply Portuguese municipalities’ tariffs. Accordingly, essential <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> of water for representative households are computed, and then compared with the lowest tariff block’s upper limit by water utility. Next, representative households are ranked by costs underlying essential <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> and by income. This analysis also considers concentration curves and indexes which show that water bills are regressive, i. e., there is socioeconomic inequity favourable to the better-off representative households.
