A typical (modern) {{manure spreader}} {{consists of a}} trailer towed behind a tractor with a rotating mechanism driven by the tractor's power take off (PTO).

5000|$|A UK {{version of}} the show was aired in 2004 by Channel 4. The team always {{included}} a Hell's Angel known as [...] "Cookie". There was a budget of Â£3,000. Only 3 days {{were used for the}} build. Cars often looked radically different from the production models. Challenges included; converting a Toyota into a lawnmower, a Lotus into a hovercraft, and an ice cream van into a riot truck. In one episode, the team sold the internal fittings of the car that was to be transformed (A Rolls Royce) to raise funds to convert it into a <b>muck</b> <b>spreader.</b>|$|E
