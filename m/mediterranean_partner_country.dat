40|$|In {{this study}} {{the case of}} olive oil imports of Germany is {{examined}} since olive oil is a traditional Mediterranean commodity and Germany is the biggest importer in the EU. A gravity model has been employed so as to analyse those factors that explain the German imports of olive oil that were identified in a preceding analysis of the German olive oil supply chain. The results of two random-effects models corrected for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity suggest that being a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Partner</b> <b>country</b> of the EU has the highest impact on trade flows to Germany, thus supporting further Euromediterranean trade integration. The level of trade to Germany is positively related to existence of direct marketing channels and to tourism implying that these factors should be explored more in the future by the Mediterranean countries so as to boost their exports. gravity model, olive oil, Germany, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

The modelling exercise is carried out with the partial equilibrium multi-commodity multi-region world trade model AGRISIM. The effects vary between the markets and depend mainly on the initial level of trade protection. Supposing that level of preferences granted to the MPCs by the EU remains as of 2001 then the effects are particularly distinguishable for high protected markets like beef in Turkey, milk and rice in Morocco and olive oil in all MPCs. Supposing that the free trade area with the EU is accomplished, then the impacts are evident mainly on beef, milk and sugar markets, where the prices among the preferential partners are {{much higher than the}} world market ones. The farmers are faced with lower supply and prices, which in turn reduce their income and their surplus, but to the benefit of the consumers and of the tax payers resulting to an increase of the overall welfare. Preference erosion effects on typical Mediterranean commodities such as olive oil, oranges and tomatoes are smoother when the free trade area is in force. preference erosion, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Partner</b> <b>Countries,</b> AGRISIM, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

The firms form alliances, as international strategy, if the environment and rules support their cooperation. When the economy of the <b>country</b> of <b>partner</b> is not stable, firms prefer equity alliances. The assumption is that the market integration process increases the collaborations between the firms of involved countries. The trend of flows of direct investment, in which the international strategic alliances are accounted, supports the assumption. The research question is: ‘Is the Barcellona (1995) process increasing the formation of international strategic alliances between European firms and firms of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Partner</b> Countries?’. The research is an exploratory study, which analyzes data of the annual reports of the observatory of European Commission (MIPO) of the agency (ANIMA) created by European Commission to support the cooperation between countries. The data-set is the collection of equity international strategic alliances between European firms and firms of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Partner</b> <b>Countries,</b> through manual cross checks of the list of flows of direct investment in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Partner</b> <b>Countries,</b> from 2004 to 2008. The statistical analysis is descriptive and it is composed by a comparison of the equity international strategic alliances (EISA) with the risk rank of countries, and by the breakdown of trends of EISAs in every MPC with the year of agreements and the value of funds received by European Commission. The statistical analyses show that EISA from European countries in MPCs are not influenced in a strong way by the risk of the MPCs. In Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and Israel the EISAs are increasing. Further evidence is still to be obtained in the next steps of analysis. The implications of results of this study suggest topics of research that should be more inquired in literature. The entrepreneurs will be informed on the characteristics of investments in Euro Mediterranean area, thus they will take choices in the future on their business.
