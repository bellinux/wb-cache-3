While these data are primarily reported in females, this review will focus on the small number of studies performed in males that report an association of polychlorinated biphenyls with earlier sexual <b>maturity</b> <b>rating</b> and confirm subtle effects of lead, dioxins, and endosulfan on delaying pubertal onset and progression in boys. Recent studies have also demonstrated that EDC exposure may affect pubertal testosterone production without having a noticeable effect on sexual <b>maturity</b> <b>rating.</b> A limitation to understand the effects of EDCs in humans is the potential for confounding due to the long temporal lag from early-life exposures to adult outcomes. The complex interplay of multiple environmental exposures over time also complicates the interpretation of human studies.

Canonical transformation was used with an expectation-maximization algorithm. To allow description of (co) variances within and across yield traits and parities, four lactation stages of 75 d were defined 6 for each parity, and the test day nearest {{the center of each}} interval was used. Prior to analysis, data were adjusted for lactation curves within lactation stages using all records from all available cows. Data from cows with missing values were excluded to allow a canonical transformation to be used for estimation of (co) variance matrices. Data from 9110 cows were available for canonical analysis of lactations with test days in all lactation stages. (Co) variance functions were used to describe (co) variance structure within and across yield trait and parity. (Co) variance components of biological functions (305 -d yield, persistency defined as difference between yields on d 280 and 60, and <b>maturity</b> <b>rate</b> defined as difference between second- and first-lactation yields) were developed from (co) variance functions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{response}} of maturity, vigor, plant spread, plant height, three forage harvest yields, and total forage yield to heterosis and inbreeding was studied in tall fescue. Parent clones selected for diverse anthesis date, origin, and morphology were separated {{into two groups}} based on anthesis date, those having early maturity and those having late maturity. Parents, single-cross (SX), and first generation selfed (S₁) progeny were field evaluated. Parents, S₁, and SX progeny were space planted on a. 914 x 1. 219 meter basis at the Hyslop Agronomy Field Laboratory, Corvallis, Oregon, in September, 1969. A randomized block design having four blocks and 14 plant rows as entries was used. Data were collected during the spring, summer, and fall of 1972. Single-cross progeny had a mean performance better than their midparents ' mean performance for all characteristics, with all differences significant except for plant height and third harvest forage yield. Single-cross progeny averaged 7. 03, 13. 18, 13. 50, 3. 89, 42. 93, 51. 72, 15. 14, and 37. 12 percent better than their midparents for <b>maturity</b> <b>rating,</b> vigor rating, plant spread, plant height, first, second, and third harvest forage yield, and forage yield, respectively. There was a greater frequency of individual single-crosses that exhibited significant heterosis in the early x late group than in either the early x early or late x late groups. In addition the average heterotic {{response of}} the early x late group was consistently {{greater than that of}} either of the other two groups. Thus it appears significant heterosis is more likely to occur, and is likely to be of a greater magnitude, in the progeny of parents having maturity differences, and presumably, greater genetic differences. Significant variation occurred among the single-cross maturity group means for all characteristics with the early x early single crosses most often being the better performers. Consequently the additional heterosis observed in the early x late group was usually insufficient to bring performance of this group up to that of the higher performing but less heterotic early x early single-crosses. This suggests heterosis may be of little practical importance. Inbreeding depression of S₁ progeny was significant for all characteristics. The inbreeding depression was of the greatest magnitude in the progeny of the early parents. Performance of early parents and early S₁ progeny was generally better than that of their late counterparts. Heritability estimates were high, particularly those obtained by regressing single-cross progeny on midparents, although two did not differ significantly from zero. The coefficients of determination for the same associations were likewise high, with over 70 percent of progeny variation being explained by linear association with parents for most characteristics. As superior progeny came from superior parents, this high degree of association suggests clonal evaluation may be an effective screening method in tall fescue. There was strong association among the characteristics of <b>maturity</b> <b>rating,</b> plant spread, plant height, first and third forage yield, and total forage yield, with the lowest of these coefficients of determination, R² =. 6031, occurring between <b>maturity</b> <b>rating</b> and plant spread.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on {{research}} into the status of information and communication technology in use at members of the Association of African Business Schools (AABS). DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH: The research reported on in this paper was carried out using a questionnaire sent by email to the target population (all the members of the AABS). The questionnaire covered a wide range of issues, including information technology strategy and governance, as well as the operational aspects of the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the institutions surveyed. Questions were based on topics identified from the literature and a recent industry survey conducted in one of the member countries, and the assessment criteria were based on a <b>maturity</b> <b>rating</b> scale. FINDINGS: This research helps to further an understanding of the use of ICT in the organisations that responded to the survey. Overall, there was a high level of understanding or applicability (over 95 %) among the topics surveyed across all schools, but there was a significant proportion where no action on that topic had yet been taken (over 30 % of all maturity ratings across all respondents). Average <b>maturity</b> <b>rating</b> across all topics for all respondents was 2. 3 (action taken but an informal approach to the topic is currently used) on a scale from 0 to 5. Implications: This research has important implications for the organisations responding to the survey and their awareness of the issues they face as institutions that seek to leverage their investments in ICT to raise their own competitive position and thus that of African organisations which have students educated at these business schools. There are also implications for the future success of the newly-formed AABS and its other initiatives in terms of meeting the objectives of the Association. ORIGINALITY / VALUE: This research is original in terms of which there is a broad understanding of the extent to which ICT is available and in use amongst the members of the AABS. Prior to the foundation of the Association, no suitable forum existed for the conduct of this research. The originality therefore, is in the opportunity presented to form a broader understanding of the status of the use of ICT to support the activities of business schools across Africa. The value of this research may be applied to both those respondents to the survey, other members of the AABS and other business schools operating in Africa that wish to understand the issues in the field of ICT that they should be addressing...|$|E

Is the lack of findings reassuring? Case 2 An 18 -month-old girl {{is brought to}} her pediatrician’s office. Her family has noted blood in her diaper 1 week prior to the appointment. There is no his-tory of trauma and no known explana-tion for the bleeding. On physical ex-amination the child is crying but is easily calmed by her mother after the examination. The only significant find-ing is a separation or interruption (pos...|$|E
50|$|Rising (or falling) {{interest}} rates rarely rise {{by the same}} amount all along the yield curve—the curve rarely moves up in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger capital loss for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long <b>maturity's</b> <b>rate</b> will change much less, flattening the yield curve. The greater change in rates at the short end will offset to some extent the advantage provided by the shorter bond's lower duration.|$|R

For such an approach, the parameters {{that are used to}} describe growth curves were treated as phenotypes under a GWASmodel. Data from 1, 255 Brahman cattle that were weighed at birth, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months of age were analyzed. Parameter estimates, such as mature weight (A) and <b>maturity</b> <b>rate</b> (K) from non-linear models are utilized as substitutes for the original body weights for the GWAS analysis. We chose the best nonlinear model to describe the weight-age data, and the estimated parameters were used as phenotypes in a multi-trait GWAS. Our aims were to identify and characterize associated SNP markers to indicate SNP-derived candidate genes and anno-tate their function as related to growth processes in beef cattle. The Brody model presented the best goodness of fit, and the heritability values for the parameter estimates for mature weight (A) and <b>maturity</b> <b>rate</b> (K) were 0. 23 and 0. 32, respectively, proving that these trait...|$|R
40|$|The fndings of {{the present}} study {{indicated}} that the participating Saudi children had a tendency towards late maturation with the mean skeletal age of the participating subjects being signifcantly lower (P< 0. 05) than the chronological age at various skeletal maturity stages. When considering the <b>rate</b> of skeletal <b>maturity,</b> the participating Saudi children demonstrated a comparable <b>maturity</b> <b>rate</b> to that of other children from different populations.
