In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{vertical}} {{structure of the}} Internet {{can be considered as}} being made up of three-level components: backbone-level interconnection, mid-level transit, and local-level access. Furthermore, the connection of networks can be classified into two types: one-way and two-way connections. This paper will analyze one-way and two-way connections and attempt to integrate them with the three-level components model. Three main conclusions will be obtained: first, two-way connection is <b>more</b> socially <b>desirable</b> than one-way connection; second, the cross entry of vertical integrators is <b>more</b> socially <b>desirable</b> than no entry and single entry; third, the local structure of one-way connection and the global structure of two-way connection should be determined at the same time, and, if any, the local bottleneck of one-way connection should be determined afterward rather than beforehand...|$|R

5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is <b>more</b> <b>desirable,</b> as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E

Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District Gas Company in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over street lighting, that the area was consistently lit at night.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is <b>more</b> <b>desirable.</b> Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was <b>more</b> <b>desirable</b> to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{magnitude}} of sex and racial differences in faking behavior, specifically socially desirable responding, in a large (N = 295, 517), applied sample. Results indicated that females are engaging in <b>more</b> intentional socially <b>desirable</b> responding, whereas males are engaging in <b>more</b> inadvertent socially <b>desirable</b> responding. However, these differences are not likely to influence selection. Caucasians are displaying <b>more</b> intentional socially <b>desirable</b> responding than African Americans (d = 0. 55), Hispanics (d = 0. 57), and Asian Americans (d = 0. 29). Asian Americans - iii - engaged in less inadvertent socially desirable responding than Caucasians (d = 0. 38), African Americans (d = 0. 44), and Hispanics (d = 0. 40). In a simulated hiring situation, employing cut-off scores for both conscientiousness scores and socially desirable responding to eliminate fakers, only Asian Americans were less likely to be selected.

5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be <b>more</b> <b>desirable</b> for future experiments.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the <b>more</b> <b>desirable</b> items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers.
