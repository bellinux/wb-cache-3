40|$|More {{than half}} of {{maternal}} deaths in the UK are due to pre-existing <b>medical</b> <b>conditions,</b> and <b>medical</b> emergencies often mimic acute obstetric conditions. An acute flare of systemic lupus erythaematosus, a thyroid storm or a phaeochromocytoma have many of the {{signs and symptoms of}} imminent eclampsia. Similarly, severe postpartum haemorrhage can result in diagnostic difficulties of <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> such as Addison's syndrome or acute renal failure. An acute collapse can be due to a pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, tachyarrhythmia or myasthenia gravis.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} prevalence of both depression and chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> globally but the relationship between depression and multi-morbidity is not well understood. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationship between depression, multi-morbidity (number of chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions,</b> and measures of socioeconomic standing (SES) in an elderly Hong Kong population. Methods Cross sectional study. Information on clinically relevant depressive symptoms, measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and demographic and chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> were collected using standardized questionnaires. Information collected on SES included educational status (ES), maximum ever income (MEI), and self-perceived social standing in local community (SES-COM) and in Hong Kong generally (SES-HK). Analysis was conducted using multiple logistic regression Results Depression rates were similar in men and women (GDS caseness 8. 1 % vs 8. 4 %). Multi-morbidity of chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> was common (40 % of men and 46 % of women had three or more). In the overall sample, the prevalence of depression was associated with the number of chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> (OR 1. 27; CI: 1. 16 â€“ 1. 39). In addition, SES-HK and SES-COM were significant independent variables. Conclusion In this elderly Hong Kong population, depression prevalence rose markedly with number of chronic <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> and SES-HK and SES-COM. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Assessing people's {{ability to}} drive {{has become a}} public health concern in most industrialized countries. Although age itself is not a {{predictive}} factor of an increased risk for dangerous driving, the prevalence of <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> that may impair driving increases with age. Because {{the implementation of a}} screening for unsafe driving due to <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> is a public health issue, its usefulness should be judged using standardised criteria already proposed for screening for chronic disease. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose standardised criteria suitable to assess the scientific validity of screening for unsafe driving due to <b>medical</b> <b>conditions,</b> and identify potential issues to be clarified before screening can be implemented and effective. Discussion Using criteria developed for screening for chronic diseases and published studies on driving with <b>medical</b> <b>conditions,</b> we specify six criteria to judge the opportunity of screening for unsafe driving due to <b>medical</b> <b>conditions.</b> This adaptation was needed because of the complexity of the natural history of <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> and their potential consequences on driving and road safety. We then illustrate that published studies pleading for or against screening for unsafe driving due to <b>medical</b> <b>conditions</b> fail to provide the needed documentation. Individual criteria were mentioned in 3 to 72 % of 36 papers pleading for or against screening. Quantitative estimates of relevant indicators were provided in at most 42 % of papers, and some data, such as the definition of an appropriate unsafe driving period were never provided. Summary The standardised framework described in this paper provides a template for assessing the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) of proposed measures for screening for unsafe driving due to <b>medical</b> <b>conditions.</b> Even if most criteria were mentioned in the published literature pleading for or against such a screening, the failure to find quantitative and evidence-based estimates of relevant indicators provides useful insight for further research. </p...|$|R
