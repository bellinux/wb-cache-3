50|$|The studio {{building}} {{contains two}} major sound stages, rooms for rehearsal, music, orchestra, costume designing, sewing, storage, set design, props, hairdressing, make-up, dressing, art, and sound mixing. In the 1960s these rooms were fully furnished, {{in addition to}} a huge costume department, <b>lighting</b> <b>switchboard,</b> laboratories for film processing and editing, and construction shops. The studio has a 108 ft. glassed-in tower that by 2013 had been adapted into the Mission Point historical museum.|$|R
5000|$|The theatre had {{seating for}} 550. Its Prussian-blue stage curtain was complemented by gray side walls and red carpeting. Backstage were nine {{dressing}} rooms. Monroe designed an electronic <b>lighting</b> <b>switchboard</b> - a [...] "smaller {{version of the}} system used in New York City's Metropolitan Opera House" [...] - to accommodate a variety of productions, including plays, operas, concerts, films, and lectures.

50|$|Arriving home, {{he finds}} that the woman {{masquerading}} as Sheetal is neither surprised nor scared. She directs him to meet Rathore. Rathore demands the photos. Satyaveer turns over the photos he had taken. Not surprisingly, Rathore isn't the least bit interested in photos of him having an argument with his biological daughter. It turns out that Neetu (the girl pretending to be Sheetal) is a concubine for Rathore. Rathore now openly threatens him and asks that he hand over those photos. Satyaveer returns home. He scans one of the photos he had taken and suddenly finds a clue in it. This clue leads him to what Manorama had said {{to him on the}} night she died. The clue was that Manorama from his book died at page 32. He uses the clues to land up in the room of a small hotel in town, where he discovers a shocking set of photos in a packet cached behind the <b>light</b> <b>switchboard.</b>|$|R

50|$|The first lightvessel {{conversion}} to solar power {{was made in}} 1995, and all vessels except the '20 class' have now been converted. The '20 class' is a slightly larger type of vessel that derives its power from diesel electric generators. Where a <b>main</b> <b>light</b> with a visible range in excess of 20 nautical miles (37 km) is required, a '20 class' vessel is used, as the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> from a Trinity House solar lightvessel has a maximum range of 19 nautical miles (35 km).|$|R
5000|$|The first {{lighthouse}} in Muskegon was {{a wooden}} tower atop the Keeper’s Quarters built in 1851. It was situated on land.

[...] In 1902, it was determined that the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> should be relocated to the south pierhead.

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} between 1912 and 1913 as a sector light to warn ships of a sand {{bank in the}} approach to the Lister Tief nautical channel {{and to have a}} supplement to the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> at Kampen, 2.5 kilometres to the south. It became operational in 1913 and was electrified in 1936. Until its deactivation in 1975 it was maintained by the keepers of the Kampen lighthouse. When Rotes Kliff was extinguished, the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> at Kampen took over its part with a red section of light. Today the tower serves as a daymark without any lighting facility and is owned by the Kampen municipality who financed a restoration of the tower in 1993.|$|R

2500|$|Wigwags {{manufactured}} by WRRS and its predecessors were once numerous in the Midwest, with almost every town {{using them to}} protect their main crossings. The most common model was called the Autoflag #5. They functioned {{in much the same}} way as the Magnetic Flagmen. They utilized alternating electromagnets to swing a shaft with an attached illuminated banner. Bells were not integral to the devices as with the Magnetic Flagmen. They employed standard bells that were used on other types of signals, and mounted either to the mast or to a bracket on the top of the center harp style, as in the Devil's Lake, WI photo. Autoflag #5s were widely used on the C, CB, Illinois Central, Soo Line and the Milwaukee Road. A few were also used on the Louisville & Nashville and the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio as well as other roads in the US and Canada. Most of these wigwags were removed in the 1970-1980s as crossings were updated. They were made in both a lower quadrant style and a center harp style similar to the Magnetic Flagman's peachbasket style. [...] Early on, there were Autoflag [...] #5s that would hold the banner behind a shield much like the Magnetic Flagman disappearing banner-style. [...] These were replaced as time went on with the standard two-position banner that hung vertically when not energized. [...] Several railroad, such as the GM and CB, had a second <b>light</b> below the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> on the banner.
