5000|$|With the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, {{it no longer}} seemed {{economically}} viable to power the future high-speed train with fossil fuels. The requirements were changed to fully electric operation, which resulted in an extensive redesign and test program. In April 1974, the Z7001 experimental electric railcar, nicknamed [...] "Zébulon", began trials. Zébulon was rebuilt from the Z7115 which had been wrecked. Using this vehicle, the new Y226 long-wheelbase power truck (precursor of the Y230 of the production TGV) was developed and tested, with its body-mounted traction motors and tripod cardan transmission. Body mounting of the traction motors was a major innovation; it allowed a considerable (3300 kg) reduction in {{the mass of the}} power truck, giving it a very high critical speed and exceptional tracking stability. Zébulon also served to develop a two-stage high speed pantograph, which later became the AM-PSE pantograph of the TGV Sud-Est, as well as a new type of eddy current rail brake. The eddy current rail brake exerts a <b>magnetic</b> <b>retention</b> effort, without ever making contact with the rail. The promise of high efficiency and low wear was however outweighed by problems with overheating in the rail, and the design was dropped. Zébulon's suspension, of a non-pneumatic design, was completely satisfactory so it was adopted for the new high speed train, instead of the TGV 001's pneumatic suspension.|$|E

The crystals have potential for magnetic separation of paramagnetic chemical or biochemical entities (e. g., proteins) by providing local magnetic fields at the interstitial sites to promote <b>magnetic</b> <b>retention</b> of the entities of interest. Structural characterizations by transmission electron microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering using a synchrotron source indicate a hcp arrangement of the nanoparticles in the colloidal crystals.

Under applied fields, the colloidal crystals display substantially stronger magnetic responses than the unaligned particle assembly, thus favoring removal of the colloidal crystals from the mixture by magnetic means after magnetic separation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intra-articular drug {{delivery}} systems still suffer from too short-lasting effects. Magnetic particles {{retained in the}} joint using an external magnetic field might prolong the local release of an anti-inflammatory drug. For the purpose, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and dexamethasone 21 -acetate (DXM) were co-encapsulated into biodegradable microparticles. METHODS: Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles embedding both SPIONs and DXM were prepared by a double emulsion technique. The formulation was optimized in two steps, a screening design and a full factorial design, aiming at 10 -microm particle diameter and high DXM encapsulation efficacy. RESULTS: The most significant parameters were the polymer concentration, the stirring speed during solvent extraction and the extractive volume. Increasing the polymer concentration from 200 to 300 mg ml(- 1), both the microparticle mean diameter and the DXM encapsulation efficacy increased up to 12 microm and 90 %, respectively. The microparticles could be retained with an external magnet of 0. 8 T placed at 3 mm. Faster DXM release was obtained for smaller microparticles.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Conventional {{corticosteroid}} suspensions for the intra-articular {{treatment of}} arthritis suffer from limitations such as crystal formation or rapid clearance from the joint. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate an innovative alternative consisting of corticosteroid encapsulation into magnetically retainable microparticles. METHODS: Microparticles (1 or 10 microm) containing both superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and dexamethasone 21 -acetate (DXM) were prepared. In a preliminary study, we compared the persistence of microparticles of both sizes in the joint. A second study evaluated the influence of a subcutaneously implanted magnet near the knee on the retention of magnetic microparticles in the joint by in vivo imaging. Finally, the efficacy of 10 -microm microparticles was investigated using a model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice. Phosphate-buffered saline, DXM suspension, SPION suspension, blank microparticles and microparticles containing only SPIONs were used as controls. Arthritis severity was assessed using 99 mTc accumulation and histological scoring. RESULTS: Due to their capacity of encapsulating more corticosteroid and their increased joint retention, the 10 -microm microparticles were more suitable vectors than the 1 -microm microparticles for corticosteroid delivery to the joint. The presence of a magnet resulted in higher <b>magnetic</b> <b>retention</b> in the joint, as demonstrated by a higher fluorescence signal. The therapeutic efficacy in AIA of 10 -microm microparticles containing DXM and SPIONs was similar to that of the DXM suspension, proving that the bioactive agent is released. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of DXM-containing microparticles was more important than that of blank microparticles or microparticles containing only SPIONs. The presence of a magnet did not induce a greater inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of an innovative approach of using magnetically retainable microparticles as intra-articular drug delivery systems. A major advantage comes from a versatile polymer matrix, which allows the encapsulation of many classes of therapeutic agents (for example, p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors), which may reduce systemic side effects...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{formalism}} {{to describe the}} outgassing of hydrogen initially implanted by the solar wind protons into exposed soils on airless bodies. The formalism applies a statistical mechanics approach similar to that applied recently to molecular adsorption onto activated surfaces. The key element enabling this formalism is the recognition that the interatomic potential between the implanted H and regolith-residing oxides is not of singular value but possess a distribution of trapped energy values at a given temperature, F(U,T). All subsequent derivations of the outward diffusion and H retention rely on the specific properties of this distribution. We find that solar wind hydrogen can be retained if there are sites in the implantation layer with activation energy values exceeding 0. 5 eV. We especially examine the dependence of H retention applying characteristic energy values found previously for irradiated silica and mature lunar samples. We also apply the formalism to two cases that differ from the typical solar wind implantation at the Moon. First, we test for a case of implantation in magnetic anomaly regions where significantly lower-energy ions of solar wind origin {{are expected to be}} incident with the surface. In <b>magnetic</b> anomalies, H <b>retention</b> is found to be reduced due to the reduced ion flux and shallower depth of implantation. Second, we also apply the model to Phobos where the surface temperature range is not as extreme as the Moon. We find the H atom retention in this second case is higher than the lunar case due to the reduced thermal extremes (that reduces outgassing) ...|$|R
40|$|Chagas {{disease is}} a serious health problem in Latin America. Hidroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) is a nitrofurazone prodrug more active than nitrofurazone against Trypanosoma cruzi. However, NFOH {{presents}} low aqueous solubility, high photodecomposition and high toxicity. The present work {{is focused on the}} characterization of an inclusion complex of NFOH in 2 -hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). The complexation with HP-beta-CD was investigated using reversed-phase liquid chromatography, solubility isotherms and nuclear <b>magnetic</b> resonance. The <b>retention</b> behavior was analyzed on a reversed-phase C- 18 column, using acetonitrile-water (20 / 80, v/v) as the mobile phase, in which HP-beta-CD was incorporated as a mobile phase additive. The decrease in the retention times with increasing concentrations of HP-beta-CD enables the determination of the apparent stability constant of the complex (K = 6. 2 +/- 0. 3 M- 1) by HPLC. The solubility isotherm was studied and the value for the apparent stability constant (K = 7. 9 +/- 0. 2 M- 1) was calculated. The application of continuous variation method indicated the presence of a complex with 1 : 1 NFOH:HP-beta-CD stoichiometry. The photostability study showed that the formation of an inclusion complex had a destabilizing effect on the photodecomposition of NFOH when compared to that of the ""free"" molecule in solution. The mobility investigation (by NMR longitudinal relaxation time) gives information about the complexation of NFOH with HP-beta-CD. In preliminary toxicity studies, cell viability tests revealed that inclusion complexes were able to decrease the toxic effect (p < 0. 01) caused by NFOH. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers {{have become}} the most popular tool for wrinkle {{treatment}} and volumization, although HA is generally absorbed within 6 – 12 months and requires repeated treatments to maintain the effects. Methods: HA was injected onto the bone for volumization with a small 30 -gauge needle to examine the long-lasting effects. Of the 63 Japanese patients with 97 treated sites followed up more than 12 months, 51 had HA injections for cosmetic purposes and 12 were treated for reconstructive volumization of facial deformity such as localized scleroderma and postsurgical bony deformity. Treated sites included the forehead, temple, nasal root, mentum, tear trough, and infraorbital sulcus. Results: After long-term follow-up (12 – 93 months, mean = 21. 6), persistent volumizing effects were observed in most patients. In fact, 86. 6 % of the treated sites showed > 50 % volume retention and 49. 5 % showed > 75 % <b>retention.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> resonance imaging analyses revealed that the injected space was well maintained, capsulated, and filled with heterogeneous content. Magnetic resonance imaging quantitative T 2 maps indicated {{that much of the}} injected HA was replaced with other materials. Together with clinical inspection, these findings suggest that onlay injection of HA on the bone induced formation of capsule, fibrosis, and/or calcification/ossification, which contributed to persistent volumization. Conclusions: Semipermanent volumizing effects can be achieved by HA injection if the target area has an underlying bony floor. Periosteal stem cells may be activated by HA injection and may contribute to persistent volumizing effects. This treatment may be a much less invasive alternative to fat or bone grafting...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine SocietyWe have {{previously}} described the phenotype {{resulting from a}} missense mutation in the IGF-I gene, which leads to expression of IGF-I with a methionine instead of a valine at position 44 (Val 44 Met IGF-I). This mutation caused severe growth and mental retardation as well as deafness evident at birth and growth retardation in childhood, but is relatively well tolerated in adulthood. We have conducted a biochemical and structural analysis of Val 44 Met IGF-I to provide a molecular basis for the phenotype observed. Val 44 Met IGF-I exhibits a 90 -fold decrease in type 1 IGF receptor (IGF- 1 R) binding compared with wild-type human IGF-I and only poorly stimulates autophosphorylation of the IGF- 1 R. The ability of Val 44 Met IGF-I to signal via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and Akt/protein kinase B pathways and to stimulate DNA synthesis is correspondingly poorer. Binding or activation of both insulin receptor isoforms is not detectable even at micromolar concentrations. However, Val 44 Met IGF-I binds IGF-binding protein- 2 (IGFBP- 2), IGFBP- 3, and IGFBP- 6 with equal affinity to IGF-I, suggesting the maintenance of overall structure, particularly in the IGFBP binding domain. Structural analysis by nuclear <b>magnetic</b> resonance confirms <b>retention</b> of near-native structure with only local side-chain disruptions despite the significant loss of function. To our knowledge, our results provide the first structural study of a naturally occurring mutant human IGF-I associated with growth and developmental abnormalities and identifies Val 44 as an essential residue involved in the IGF-IGF- 1 R interaction.
