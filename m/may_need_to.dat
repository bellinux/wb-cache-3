5|$|While thunderclap {{headache}} is {{the characteristic}} symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage, less than 10% {{of those with}} concerning symptoms have SAH on investigations. A number of other causes <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be considered.|$|E

50|$|Cats {{with the}} {{condition}} cannot be grasped by the scruff, as this may tear away. The syndrome is also linked to slipping joints, as in human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Dietary supplements <b>may</b> be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> promote skin healing and regrowth. Antibiotics <b>may</b> be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> combat infection when skin has split or torn.|$|R
50|$|These {{are called}} {{technical}} contradictions by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More {{of one thing}} and less {{of the same thing}} may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature <b>may</b> be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature <b>may</b> be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> achieve a homogeneous mixture.|$|R
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be controlled as weeds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} after his 201011 {{freshman}} season, he was described as the best point guard {{from the state of}} Minnesota since Khalid El-Amin. Another Minnesotan who is a measuring stick for Jones is Sam Jacobson. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, when he plays for Duke, Jones is likely to finish among the top 5 in the nation in assists per game but <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work on his defense.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E

5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if any {{synthetic}} elements with atomic number above 99 are gases. If it transpires that copernicium and flerovium are gaseous metals at or near room temperature, as some calculations as well as preliminary experimental results have suggested, the category of elemental gases <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be sub-divided into metallic and nonmetallic gases.|$|E

5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI, among them increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, respiratory infection, and urinary tract infection. Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. Assistive devices <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be altered and medications changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E
5|$|The sarus crane is {{classified}} as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats include habitat destruction and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species. The effects of inbreeding in the Australian population <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be studied.|$|E

5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E
5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase zinc intake.|$|E

5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{tellurium}} is {{not considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
