The long descriptive passages, {{some of which may}} have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E

50|$|The short-tailed snake is as poorly {{understood}} {{as it is}} seldom-seen, rare and geographically limited. It is a burrowing snake that rarely appears above ground and does so even more rarely during the day. Like other snakes of the tribe Lampropeltini, it vibrates its tail when startled by predators or people but can be distinguished from a rattlesnake by its slender build and lack of rattle. An excitable snake, it makes a poor captive and is protected against harassment or captivity by Florida law. Despite this, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> little <b>we</b> know about the short-tailed snake {{has been based on}} observations of captive specimens.|$|R

Before the Hepburn Commission of 1878, investigating the railroads of New York, he fine-tuned his circumlocutory, ambiguous, and haughty responses. His most intractable performance was later in a 1906 lawsuit {{by the state of}} Missouri, which claimed that two companies in that state registered as independents were actually subsidiaries of Standard Oil, a secret ownership Rogers finally acknowledged.|$|E

For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.|$|E

According to Sir William Smith, {{with the exception of}} a few remarks by Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Isocrates, we are mainly dependent on Diogenes Laërtius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus for biographical details.

We also have many actual samples of Mars {{in the form of}} meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E
25|$|The fleet sailed {{further and}} further south, {{avoiding}} the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and become the first to reach Tierra del Fuego {{at the tip of}} the Americas. On October 21, starting in Cape Virgenes, they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600km) long strait that Magellan named Estrecho de Todos los Santos, the modern Strait of Magellan. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named Mar Pacífico because of its apparent stillness. The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines, leaving the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano the task of completing the voyage, reaching the Spice Islands in 1521. On September 6, 1522 Victoria returned to Spain, thus completing the first circumnavigation of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the Trinidad. Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know about this voyage.|$|E

The mental structure is even less determinate than the bodily. In our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of superseding old inherent instincts by new suggestions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas. Very <b>much</b> indeed <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call moral education, he said, is such an artificial modification and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained into courageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexuality into religious emotion. And the great difference between man and monkey is in the larynx, he continued,--in the incapacity to frame delicately different sound-symbols by which thought could be sustained. In this I failed to agree with him, but with a certain incivility he declined to notice my objection. He repeated that the thing was so, and continued his account of his work.|$|R

5000|$|We {{seem to be}} {{reaching}} {{a point at which}} science can wrest morality from the hands of philosophers. That this is already happening—albeit largely at a theoretical level—is evident from recent books by, among others, Richard D. Alexander, Robert Frank, James Q.

The occasional disagreements within this budding field are far outweighed by the shared belief that evolution needs to be part of any satisfactory explanation of morality. … It takes up space in our heads, it reaches out to fellow human beings, and it is as <b>much</b> a part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are as the tendencies that it holds in check.|$|R
40|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> little <b>we</b> {{know about}} the impact of {{unemployment}} or health is based upon data or studies of predominantly unemployed men. These studies, though weak in methodology, imply that unemployment may lead to excess morbidity and mortality. This paper reports a study of 4, 000 pregnant women in Brisbane. Unemployment amongst women is associated with high-risk health behaviour, which in turn may lead to low birthweight births. Further, unemployed women are more anxious and depressed than are employed women. The mental health of the mother appears to be more closely related to the employment status of her spouse than to her own employment status. There have been few attempts to systematically assess the health consequences of unemployment in general and of female unemployment in particular. In part this may be attributed to traditional patterns of sex-role socialisation and the so- called work ethic, under which male identity is generally ascribed to work-related activities. Female identity, it may be thought, is uninfluenced by unemployment, as the primary female roles of wife and mother remain available to the unemployed women. In any event, large numbers of unemploye...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY—Policy {{decisions}} at the organizational, corporate, {{and governmental}} levels {{should be more}} heavily influenced by issues related to well-being––people’s evaluations and feelings about their lives. Domestic policy currently focuses heavily on economic outcomes, although economic indicators omit, and even mislead about, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> society values. <b>We</b> show that economic indicators have many shortcomings, and that mea-sures of well-being point to important conclusions that are not apparent from economic indicators alone. For example, al-though economic output has risen steeply over the past decades, {{there has been no}} rise in life satisfaction during this period, {{and there has been a}} substantial increase in depression and distrust. We argue that economic indicators were extremely important in the early stages of economic development, when the fulfillment of basic needs was the main issue. As societies grow wealthy...|$|R

40|$|On June 22, 1969, {{just before}} noon, an oil slick and {{assorted}} debris under a railroad trestle on the Cuyahoga River caught fire. The fire attracted national media attention, and helped prompt {{the passage of}} federal environmental laws. A river on fire {{was a symbol of}} earth in need of repair, and federal regulation was the reparative tool <b>of</b> choice. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> the Cuyahoga story is mythology, however, a fable with powerful symbolic force. The river did burn in 1969 - as it and other rivers had burned many times before - and today the Cuyahoga and many U. S. rivers are far less polluted.

This paper revisits the context and history of the legendary Cuyahoga River fire to reveal a more complex story about the causes and consequences of various institutional choices in environmental law. The aim is to provide additional perspective to the questions of institutional choice which underlie environmental policy, and to suggest that the decision to reallocate primary authority over water quality to the federal government was neither inevitable nor an unmitigated blessing...|$|R
