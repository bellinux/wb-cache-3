5|$|On July 27, 2006, a 45-year-old man {{was found}} unresponsive and not {{breathing}} on Goliath after losing consciousness during the ride.

After an inspection of the ride showed that the roller coaster was operating properly, it reopened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of <b>man,</b> <b>before</b> the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth <b>man</b> <b>before</b> Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership. New South Wales reached 432 and won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the <b>man,</b> <b>before</b> disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer {{during the}} latter's magic {{show in a}} street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young <b>man</b> <b>before</b> her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|Special {{procedures}} {{apply to}} legislation {{passed by the}} Tynwald of the Isle of <b>Man.</b> <b>Before</b> the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E

5|$|The third {{televised}} match {{featured the}} Big Boss Man facing Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow attacked Boss <b>Man</b> <b>before</b> the match and controlled the match's beginning by using power moves to wear Boss Man down. Boss Man performed two clotheslines on Bigelow {{to gain the}} advantage. Bigelow responded by throwing Boss Man with a belly to back suplex, and then threw {{him out of the}} ring. He wore Boss Man down with a bear hug. Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually tried to run at Bigelow to crush him {{in the corner of the}} ring. As Boss Man approached, Bigelow kicked him in the face and followed this up by performing a diving headbutt from the top rope to win the match by pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wellington, Shout {{had served}} in the Second Boer War as a teenager. He rose to {{sergeant}} and was mentioned in despatches for saving a wounded <b>man</b> <b>before</b> being discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the Cape Colonial Forces from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, Shout immigrated to Sydney in 1907. The family settled in Darlington, where Shout worked for Resch's Brewery as a carpenter and joiner. He was also active in the part-time Citizens' Forces, being commissioned just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. After training in Egypt, he took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The final {{took place}} on 6 May 1970 at the San Siro in Milan against Dutch side Feyenoord. Celtic were {{overwhelming}} favourites, but despite Tommy Gemmell opening the scoring after 30 minutes, they were comprehensively outplayed by the Dutch side. Feyenoord manager Ernst Happel ensured Jimmy Johnstone was double marked at all times, while the midfield trio of Franz Hasil, Willem van Hanegem and Wim Jansen dominated their Celtic counterparts. Rinus Israël quickly equalised from a free kick, but Celtic managed to hold on at 11 to force extra time. With just two minutes of extra-time remaining, a long free-kick from the Feyenoord half was sent towards the Celtic penalty area. Billy McNeil stumbled and misjudged the ball, and {{as he tried to}} recover he appeared to punch the ball away. Before the referee had a chance to award a penalty, Ove Kindvall reacted quickly and took the ball round his <b>man</b> <b>before</b> chipping it over goalkeeper Evan Williams to seal a 2–1 win for Feyenoord.|$|E

5|$|The next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was {{suspended}} above {{the ring and}} {{could be used as}} a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz choked Boss <b>Man</b> <b>before</b> making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried to climb the pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and choked Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first and got the nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.|$|E

25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit of the Old <b>Man</b> <b>before</b> tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge end position gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E

25|$|Plutarch relates several {{opinions}} {{on the end of}} Marius: one, from Posidonius, holds that Marius contracted pleurisy; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to Fortune. Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced a delusion that he was in command of the Mithridatic War, began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented, on his death bed, that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any <b>man</b> <b>before</b> him.|$|E
25|$|The words {{found in}} a book of his {{signifying}} that though the catholic religion did now serve, swear and obey, yet if occasion were offered they {{would be ready to}} help the execution, , were annexed to a text taken out of a general council of Lateran for the authority of the pope in his excommunication, and at the last council of Trent there was a consent of the catholic princes for a reformation of such realms and persons as had gone from the authority of the bishop of Rome, when it was concluded that if any catholic prince took in hand to invade any realm to reform the same to the authority of the see of Rome, that then the catholics in that realm should be ready to assist and help them. And this was the meaning of the execution as he saith, which he never revealed to any <b>man</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{helicopter}} lifted off, it {{was hit by}} NVA anti-aircraft rounds, and its engine stopped {{at an altitude of}} 4,500 feet. Rose was notified that a Marine door gunner had been shot through the neck by an NVA round, and he rendered lifesaving medical treatment to the <b>man</b> <b>before</b> the helicopter crashed, several kilometers away from the original extraction point. Rose was thrown from the helicopter before it crashed, and while still dazed and wounded crawled back into the wreckage to pull out wounded and unconscious soldiers, knowing that it could explode at any moment. He continued to treat the wounded until another helicopter arrived to extract them. Upon returning to base, Rose, covered in blood and wounds, refused all treatment until the other wounded were treated first. He was credited with treating between 60 and 70 wounded and saving many lives; only three Montagnards died in Operation Tailwind.|$|E
