The characteristics of the excitation greatly influence the quality of the resulting measurements. This paper first presents an overview of the basic excitation methods, such as, random, periodic random, pseudo-random, and burst random. The paper then reviews the use of cyclic averaging with random excitation methods. Finally, the paper develops a new excitation method that is the result of combining cyclic averaging with burst random excitation.

40|$|Kiwi (Apteryx spp.) vocalisations are {{routinely}} used {{as part of}} a nationwide monitoring programme in which call-rate is used to infer population density. The ability to individually identify kiwi would drastically improve the accuracy and quality of monitoring programmes. One potential avennue to achieve this is through acoustic identification. In many vocally active species, vocalisations have been shown to encode information about the identity of the caller (vocal individuality). This has proven extremely useful in monitoring rare, nocturnal and cryptic bird species. In this study, vocal individuality was assessed with regard to a population of great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii) residing in the Hawdon Valley, Canterbury, New Zealand. Acoustic recorders were installed near the breeding den sites of seven great spotted kiwi pairs between November 2012 and March 2013. In total 303 whistle vocalisations were recorded during this time. A range of temporal and spectral parameters were measured from the highest quality recordings. These measurements were taken at a whole call and individual syllable level. Call parameters were; number of syllables, syllable rate and syllable duration. Syllable parameters were; minimum frequency (Hz), <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>Hz),</b> bandwidth (Hz), duration (sec) and peak frequency (Hz). These variables were used to describe and classify calls using one-way repeated measures ANOVAs and stepwise discriminant function analysis. Male and female syllables are sexually dimorphic, however, the pattern of temporal and spectral variation within calls is consistent between sexes. Discriminant function analysis indicated that great spotted kiwi vocalisations were highly individualised. Male individuals were were classified with an accuracy of 95. 7 % on the basis of seven parameters. Females were classified with an accuracy of 90 % on the basis of five call parameters. In both analyses spectral parameters were shown to be most important for individual discrimination. This is the highest degree of vocal individuality in Apteryx species reported to date. Such a high degree of individuality indicates that great spotted kiwi vocalisations could be utilised for individual identification purposes. The next step is to assess the temporal stability of this phenomenon...|$|E

The mechanical seal acoustic emission signal present obvious characteristics of time-varying nonlinear and pulsating. In this paper, the acoustic emission signal is used to monitor the seal end faces just-lift-off time and friction condition. The acoustic emission signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition {{into a series of}} intrinsic mode function with independent characteristics of different time scales and different frequency band.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] tyre characteristics can have significant influence in vehicle handling, particularly in anti-lock braking system (ABS), which involves wheel speed oscillations as a result of rapid changes in wheel brake pressure. Hitherto, ABS studies have been conducted mostly with straight-line motion. Relatively simple vehicle models have been used which cannot capture the interactions between non-linear handling dynamics and tyre behaviour. This article takes such interactions into account, using a non-linear 14 -degrees-of-freedom vehicle model in combination with three different single-point contact tyre models with transient characteristics. They include a stretched-string-based model, a modified stretched-string model, and a contact mass model. The particularly demanding situation of combined cornering/ABS braking is investigated. It is shown that although all tyre models are of similar bandwidth (<b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> ≈ 15 <b>Hz),</b> the simple string tyre model fails to cope with the non-linearities involved in combined braking/cornering and predicts greater braking distances than the two more enhanced tyre models...|$|R

Following earlier work, we focus our analysis on the lower kilo-Hz QPO, for which we study the dependency of its quality factor (Q) amplitude as a function of frequency over a range covering from 500 Hz to 1000 Hz. As previously found for 4 U 1636 - 536, we show that the quality factor of the lower kilo-Hz increases with frequency up to a <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> around 800 <b>Hz,</b> beyond which an abrupt drop of its coherence is observed down to a limiting frequency where the QPO disappears completely. Simultaneously the amplitude of the QPOs is almost constant below the peak frequency and starts to decrease smoothly afterwards.

The depth of the recessed step is 0. 1 mm and the nozzle height at throat is 10. 0 mm. Pressure measurements along the nozzle axis and Schlieren visualizations were compared to numerical simulations for both the recessed-step and the clean configurations. The presence of the recessed step results in a local perturba-tion of the pressure profile along the axis close to the throat section, which superimposes to that obtained by the clean configuration immediately downstream of the nozzle throat.

The amplitude of the VP-based self-oscillating polymer chain and the activation energy for self-oscillation are hardly affected by the initial concentrations of the BZ substrates. The influences of the initial concentrations of the BZ substrates and the temperature on the period of the swelling-deswelling self-oscillation are examined in detail. Logarithmic plots of the period against the initial concentration of one BZ substrate, when the concentrations of the other two BZ substrates are fixed, show good linear relationships.

From a negative point of view, it affects performance and durability of many combustion systems, it is a major contributor of global warming, and it is linked to respiratory illness and cancer. ^ Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) was used in this study to measure soot volume fractions in four steady and twenty-eight pulsed ethylene diffusion flames burning at atmospheric pressure. A laminar coflow diffusion burner combined with a very-high-speed solenoid valve and control circuit provided unsteady flows by forcing the fuel flow with <b>frequencies</b> between 10 <b>Hz</b> and 200 Hz. Periodic flame oscillations were captured by two-dimensional phase-locked LII images and broadband luminosity images for eight phases (0 ° – 360 °) covering each period. A comparison between the steady and pulsed flames and the effect of the pulsation frequency on soot volume fraction in the flame region and the post flame region are presented. The most significant effect of pulsing frequency was observed at 10 <b>Hz.</b> At this <b>frequency,</b> the flame with the lowest mean flow rate had 1. 77 times enhancement in peak soot volume fraction and 1. 2 times enhancement in total soot volume fraction; whereas the flame with the highest mean flow rate had no significant change in the peak soot volume fraction and 1. 4 times reduction in the total soot volume fraction.

The most posterior of these nuclei, nucleus basalis, provides cholinergic drive to neocortex and is involved in arousal and attention. The physiological properties of neurons in anterior {{basal forebrain}} nuclei, including medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca and substantia innominata, have been described previously. In contrast the physiological properties of neurons in nucleus basalis, the most posterior nucleus of the basal forebrain, are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we investigate the physiological properties of neurons in adult mouse nucleus basalis. We obtained cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from magnocellular neurons in slices from P 42 - 54 mice and compared cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons, distinguished retrospectively by anti-choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry.

Moreover, the program used here {{is based on}} the assumption that the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave is dominant. Smoothing constraints, the difference between adjacent model parameters as an approximation of a derivative to control solution roughness, were also used (e.g., Menke, 1984). In this study, an initial layered model at each site is first constructed with assigned values of thickness, S-wave velocities, and Poisson’s ratio for each layer. We take a half-space structure with an S-wave velocity, which is the maximum phase velocity divided by 0.92 at the lowest frequency used, as the S-wave velocity in the initial model. Also, the total layer number and the thickness of each layer are designed to be 80 and 30 m. If we are using a <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> of 8 <b>Hz,</b> and assuming a phase velocity of 700 m/s, the minimum expected wavelength is about 90 m. Accordingly, by rule-of-thumb calculation, the highest resolution of thickness can be estimated as being about one-third of the observed minimum wavelength. Therefore, we expect to resolve a 30 -m-thick layer. A damping value of 1.0 is adopted to stabilize the inversion. The inversion process will be terminated when the difference in S-wave velocity for each layer between the adjacent inversions is less than 0.001 km/s. Although the inversion of phase velocity is non-unique, we carefully inspect the rationality of the inverted S-wave velocity and any misfit between observed and theoretical phase velocities for each inversion. Hence, a reasonable velocity model can be obtained. The above inversion process is the differential inversion technique (Herrmann, 1991).|$|R

40|$|PEER) at the University of California at Berkeley have {{developed}} a tool for large-scale simulation of earthquake effects in urban regions. The initial results from this pilot study are described in this paper. We report here results of a pilot project in which we started with three independent components: (1) earthquake ground motion modeling for a prescribed geological structure and earthquake source; (2) structural modeling of dynamic response, parameterized by properties representing typical buildings; and (3) visualization tools for dynamic motion in three-dimensional domains. The goal of the pilot project was to integrate these tools to examine the spatial distribution of damage in a region using simplified models for the ground motion and structures. We chose the hypothetical scenario of an earthquake source modeled as two doublets at 2 -km depth with a prescribed slip function and <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> of 5 <b>Hz</b> in a viscoelastic layer on a half-space measuring 20 -km by 20 -km in plan. The temporal and spatial distribution of ground motion at the surface was used to investigate the behavior of elastoplastic single degree-of-freedom models of different vibration periods, strength, and orientation. Finally, the advanced visualization tools were {{used to examine the}} propagation of earthquake energy, accumulation of structural damage in time, and distribution of structural damage in the 20 -km by 20 -km region. Figure 1 shows the model of the viscoelastic layer on a half-space with the source at the center. To determine the resulting ground motion, we used a parallel elastic wave propagation finite element simulation tool developed for modeling earthquake ground motion in large sedimentary basins (Bao et al, 1998). The wave propagation code is built on top of Archimedes, an environment for solving unstructured mesh finite-element problems on parallel computer...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{control has}} {{generated}} increasing interest {{in recent years}} with increased concerns for environmental protection and industrial safety. The traditional method of noise reduction using absorbing materials and erected barriers works effectively only at middle and high frequencies. Thus, active method {{which is based on}} the principle of destructive interference between the primary noise source and the actively generated acoustic waves is introduced. This approach works best at low frequencies when the wavelength of noise is long compared to the dimensions of its surroundings. In many existing active control methods, noise is reduced in very limited locations or along a single direction. For example, in active noise control inside passenger cars, the system is designed to reduce road noise level at passengers' seat locations; in noise reduction inside a duct, noise is reduced along the path of the duct. However, in most applications, it is desirable to reduce noise in a specific 3 -D region. In view of this, a new model-based adaptive noise control system using loudspeaker array and error sensor array is developed in this thesis. First, open loop system transfer functions are designed using a theoretical propagation model. The transfer functions thus found are regarded as the nominal values for the complete system. Second, to compensate for deviations from the theoretical model, the transfer functions are adapted using error measures from error sensor array by LMS algorithm. In addition, a linear predictor is introduced into the system for feedback control, thus input signal driving the secondary sources is obtained from the error signals. In this study, we concentrated on reduction of broadband noise with a <b>maximum</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1000 <b>Hz.</b> Theoretical and simulation results show that our approach is effective for noise reduction in three dimensional space. Experiments using real-time active noise control system confirms the performance of the designed system...|$|R
