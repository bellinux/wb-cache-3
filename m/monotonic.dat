5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a <b>monotonic</b> curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more <b>monotonic</b> trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that <b>monotonic</b> functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or <b>monotonic</b> than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The two {{principal}} ones still used today are ISO/IEC 8859-7 and Unicode. ISO 8859-7 supports only the <b>monotonic</b> orthography; Unicode supports both the <b>monotonic</b> and polytonic orthographies.|$|E

25|$|Since Modern Greek has {{a stress}} accent {{instead of a}} pitch accent, the {{circumflex}} has been replaced with an acute accent in the modern <b>monotonic</b> orthography.|$|E

25|$|The {{class of}} all preordered sets with <b>monotonic</b> {{functions}} as morphisms forms a category, Ord. It is a concrete category, i.e. a category obtained by adding {{some type of}} structure onto Set, and requiring that morphisms are functions that respect this added structure.|$|E

25|$|Reswitching {{means that}} there is no simple (<b>monotonic)</b> {{relationship}} between the nature of the techniques of production used and the rate of profit.

25|$|Suppose we {{are given}} a <b>monotonic</b> path, which may happen to cross the diagonal. The {{exceedance}} of the path is defined to be the number of vertical edges which lie above the diagonal. For example, in Figure 2, the edges lying above the diagonal are marked in red, so the exceedance of the path is 5.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{the mean}} μ of X to be 0, the median of Y will be 1, {{independent}} of the standard deviation σ of X. This is so because X has a symmetric distribution, so its median is also 0. The transformation from X to Y is <b>monotonic,</b> and so we find the median e0 = 1 for Y.|$|E
25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a <b>monotonic</b> decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued <b>monotonic</b> decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a <b>monotonic</b> decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., <b>monotonic</b> increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|Figure 4 {{illustrates}} the situation forn=3. Each of the 20 possible <b>monotonic</b> paths appears {{somewhere in the}} table. The first column shows all paths of exceedance three, which lie entirely above the diagonal. The columns to the right show the result of successive applications of the algorithm, with the exceedance decreasing one unit at a time. There are five rows, that is,C3=5.|$|E
25|$|A 'flow failure' may {{initiate}} if {{the strength}} of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain equilibrium of a slope or footing of a building for instance. This can occur due to <b>monotonic</b> loading or cyclic loading, and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the Aberfan disaster. Casagrande referred to this type of phenomena as 'flow liquefaction' although a state of zero effective stress is not required for this to occur.|$|E
25|$|Since both {{internal}} energy and entropy are <b>monotonic</b> functions of temperature T, {{implying that the}} internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).|$|E
25|$|Economist Bryan Caplan {{argues that}} many Austrians have not {{understood}} valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, {{causing them to}} overstate their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected {{to the use of}} cardinal utility in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for any <b>monotonic</b> transformation of an ordinal utility function, and do not entail cardinal utility.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is {{any of a}} number of related theorems proving the convergence of <b>monotonic</b> sequences (sequences that are increasing or decreasing) that are also bounded. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum, then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an infimum, it will converge to the infimum.|$|E
25|$|A k-crossing h-layer {{drawing of}} a graph G is a {{placement}} of the vertices of G onto h distinct horizontal lines, with edges routed as <b>monotonic</b> polygonal paths between these lines, {{in such a way}} that there are at most k crossings. The graphs with such drawings have pathwidth that is bounded by a function of h and k. Therefore, when h and k are both constant, it is possible in linear time to determine whether a graph has a k-crossing h-layer drawing.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the laws}} treated {{so far have been}} for {{conjunction}} and disjunction. These operations have the property that changing either argument either leaves the output unchanged or the output changes {{in the same way as}} the input. Equivalently, changing any variable from 0 to 1 never results in the output changing from 1 to 0. Operations with this property are said to be monotone. Thus the axioms so far have all been for <b>monotonic</b> Boolean logic. Nonmonotonicity enters via complement ¬ as follows.|$|E
25|$|As a music genre the coladeira is {{characterized}} by having a variable tempo, from allegro to andante, a 2-beat bar, and in its most traditional form by having an harmonic structure based in a cycle of fifths, while the lyrics structure is organized in strophes that alternate with a refrain. The coladeira is almost always <b>monotonic,</b> i.e. composed in just one tonality. Compositions that use more than a tonality are rare and generally they are cases of passing from a minor to major tonality or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{compatible}} with the mere order relations, functions between posets may also behave well with respect to special elements and constructions. For example, when talking about posets with least element, it may seem reasonable to consider only <b>monotonic</b> functions that preserve this element, i.e. which map least elements to least elements. If binary infima ∧ exist, then a reasonable property might be to require that f(x ∧ y) = f(x) ∧ f(y), for all x and y. All of these properties, and indeed many more, may be compiled under the label of limit-preserving functions.|$|E
25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between high interest rates (or rates of profit) and more capital-intensive techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (<b>monotonic)</b> non-increasing relationship between capital intensity and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A. This problem arises for either a macroeconomic or a microeconomic production process and so goes beyond the aggregation problems discussed above.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the theory}} of {{programmed}} death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing, but the age-dependence of death rates is very smooth and <b>monotonic.</b> However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live longer. It is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.|$|E
25|$|People who stutter {{are trained}} to reduce their {{speaking}} rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, <b>monotonic,</b> but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness {{at the end of}} treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, {{has been shown to be}} effective.|$|E
25|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{dedicated}} to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed {{of a number of}} stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a <b>monotonic</b> fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} {{helps to}} define temperature {{but it does}} not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include {{the existence of a}} unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a <b>monotonic</b> relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined {{on the basis of the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either <b>monotonic</b> loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and <b>monotonic</b> voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists {{worked very hard to}} strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E
25|$|A graph {{property}} {{is the question}} of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a <b>monotonic</b> graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E
