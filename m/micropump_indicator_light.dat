40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is motivated}} and described for representing defaults in specifications. The formalism is called Ordered Theory Presentations. The ability to represent defaults narrows the gap between a customer 's initial requirements and a formal specification, and supports reuse on both a small and a large scale. We illustrate the issues throughout {{with reference to the}} lift example. We also consider the application of the formalism to specification revision. 1 Introduction Imagine specifying a lift system. There is a lift, with n buttons and n <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> inside, and there are doors. The buttons inside the lift are for requesting where the lift goes, and the <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> register such requests. There are floors, each with two buttons and <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> (one for requesting to go up and one for down). The <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> switch on in response to button pressings and off when the lift arrives at a floor; and the lift goes from floor to floor depending {{on the state of the}} ligh [...] ...|$|R
