This can cause instabilities along a bunch train and even instabilities within a single bunch, which are known as head-tail instabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The Large Hadron Collider is very {{prone to}} <b>multipacting</b> {{due to the}} tight spacing (25 ns) of its proton bunches.

40|$|<b>Multipacting</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} of spontaneous electron loading in resonant structures, either normal or super conducting. These electrons interact with the rf field inside the resonant structure and thus cause an abrupt and huge loss of rf field. As a result, <b>multipacting</b> appears as a performance limiting phenomenon of resonant structures, e. g., cavity and waveguide. 　In the case of superconducting cavity, due to cool down to cryogenic temperature from room temperature, residual gas molecules adsorb on the inner surface of cavities and couplers. A common speculation is that these adsorbed molecules enhance the <b>multipacting.</b> In {{the research and development}} of superconducting Crab cavity for KEKB electron-positron collider, a severe <b>multipacting</b> is observed during the first time rf excitation after the cool down at 4. 2 K from room temperature. After processing the <b>multipacting,</b> if the cavity is kept at 4. 2 K, this <b>multipacting</b> is never observed during the following rf excitation. Also, in the case of KEKB superconducting accelerating cavities, <b>multipacting</b> is observed at and around the input coupler during the long time operation of KEKB. This observance of <b>multipacting</b> may be explained as that adsorption of residual gas molecules may cause this <b>multipacting.</b> Being inspired by these experimental hints, we have devoted our effort to understand the <b>multipacting</b> with respect to the adsorbed gas molecules. 　Our study is different from the present trend of <b>multipacting</b> research-simulation of <b>multipacting</b> and study on secondary yield. In our study, we have focused our concentration in the origin of <b>multipacting.</b> What molecules are responsible in <b>multipacting?</b> Is there any difference between monolayer and multilayer of adsorbed molecules in <b>multipacting?</b> In our study, we have tried to find out this kind of fundamental answers in an attempt to trace out the seed of <b>multipacting.</b> 　At first, we have designed and built up a dedicated experimental setup to lean the adsorption and desorption of residual gas molecules on cryo-cooled surface. Most exciting part of our experimental setup is to develop a Gas Flow Control System, by which we have efficiently controlled the number of molecules admitted into the vacuum chamber. This has enabled us to study the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules with respect to monolayer and multilayer. As the experimental surface on which adsorption and desorption has been studied, we have designed a cylindrical vacuum chamber. This vacuum chamber has been fabricated from the thick cylindrical pipe of oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper so that the temperature distribution along the length of vacuum chamber becomes negligible. Since the most dominant residual gas molecule in ultra high vacuum is H 2, we have extensively studied the adsorption and desorption of H 2. We have found that H 2 has a saturated pressure of the order of 10 - 4 Pa at 4. 2 K. Desoprtion of H 2 from monolayer as a function of temperature can be characterized by a broad peak at 14 K. On the contrary, desorption of H 2 from multilayer occurs very sharply at around 5. 6 K. 　Experience of the adsorption desorption experiment has been carried in the experiment of <b>multipacting</b> with respect to adsorbed gas molecules. For this study, we have designed and built up a coaxial type resonant cavity of resonant frequency is 1. 5 GHz. Mode of excitation has been so chosen that different cutting parts, for example, vacuum opening at inner conductor, have been adopted at the places where rf surface current is zero. This mode selection has enabled us to build up a coaxial cavity of rather high unloaded Q from OFHC copper. Another important feature of our design is that the inner and outer conductor can be easily separated from each other. This feature provides different options to study the <b>multipacting.</b> For example, besides the very easy access to the <b>multipacting</b> site, we can change the surface condition at the probable <b>multipacting</b> site. We have also designed and built up the unit coupling input probe, different monitor probes and the cryostat top flange. 　To study the <b>multipacting,</b> we have used three parameters: i) vacuum pressure, particularly, for <b>multipacting</b> at room temperature, ii) current due to <b>multipacting</b> electrons, and iii) reflected and transmitted signals from the cavity. In the study of room temperature <b>multipacting,</b> We have found that after processing of the <b>multipacting</b> observed below the peak electric field of 0. 28 MV/m, these <b>multipacting</b> incidents do not occur during the subsequent rf excitations, if the cavity is not exposed to ambient air. 　<b>Multipacting</b> above the peak electric filed of 0. 28 MV/m occurs during every rf excitation, even if the cavity is not exposed to ambient air. Room temperature <b>multipacting</b> observed above 0. 3 MV/m has been found not to become processed without baking at 100 ℃. This effect of baking hints that water molecule may cause or enhance <b>multipacting.</b> In contrast to room temperature, <b>multipacting</b> levels at 4. 2 K are few and soft. Once processed, <b>multipacting</b> dose not occur if the cavity is kept at 4. 2 K. We have studied the <b>multipacting</b> at 4. 2 K wiht respect to different amount of adsorption of H 2 -form saturated H 2 surface to partial monolayer of H 2. Our experiment has revealed that adsorbed H 2 dose not act as the seed of <b>multipacting,</b> rather suppresses the <b>multipacting.</b> We have also studied the effect of other dominant residual gas molecules CO. We have found that CO too does not act as the seed of <b>multipacting.</b> Also, the development of <b>multipacting</b> in micro-second level has been studied...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{electron}} impacting (<b>multipacting)</b> {{can take}} place in rf fields when the rf components are composed of materials with a secondary electron yield greater than one. In rf gun cavities, <b>multipacting</b> may change {{the properties of the}} vacuum components or even damage them. First systematic measurements of the <b>multipacting</b> occurring in a photocathode rf gun were made at the Fermilab/NICADD Photoinjector Laboratory in 2000.

In this study, we measure the <b>multipacting</b> properties in more detail and model the secondary electron generation for numerical simulation. Measurements and simulations for the photoinjectors at Fermilab and DESY are compared. The <b>multipacting</b> takes place at the photocathode in rf guns and is categorized as single-side <b>multipacting.</b> In a low rf field, the electrons emitted from the cathode area do not leave the gun cavity within one rf cycle and have an opportunity to travel back and hit the cathode.

40|$|<b>Multipacting</b> {{is seen as}} a {{performance}} limiting phenomenon for the superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Numerical simulations are essential to pre-empt the experimentally observed <b>multipacting</b> conditions. Readily available codes(e. g. FISHPACT, MULTIPACT,CST etc.) are widely used to simulate the phenomenon of <b>multipacting</b> in such cases. Most of the contemporary two dimensional (2 D) codes are unable to detect <b>multipacting</b> in the elliptical cavities because they use a simplistic secondary emission model, where a constant value of emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons is assumed. Some three-dimensional (3 D) codes, which use a more realistic and sophisticated secondary emission model (Furman model) by following a probability distribution for the emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons, are able to correctly predict the occurance of <b>multipacting.</b> These 3 D softwares however require large data handling and are slower than contemporary 2 D codes. We have developed a 2 D code for the <b>multipacting</b> analysis for axisymmetric structures, which is based on the Furman model. Since our code is 2 D, it is faster than the 3 D codes. This makes it possible to perform an accurate <b>multipacting</b> analysis of <b>multipacting</b> within a resaonalble computational time, thus achieving an accuracy as good {{as in the case of}} 3 D codes, but requiring significantly less computing time.

40|$|A {{design study}} {{has been carried out}} at CERN to define layout and {{parameters}} of a future neutrino factory. The reference scheme of this neutrino factory incorporates a muon cooling channel, which partly consists of 88 MHz accelerating cavities. In order to reveal possible technical difficulties in achieving the desired gradient of 4 MV/m, a 88 MHz test cavity has been constructed. The present work aimed to test this cavity for <b>multipacting</b> discharges. For this purpose CERN has acquired the <b>multipacting</b> simulation code MultP. In a first step two known examples of <b>multipacting</b> were analysed, to check the functionality of the code. The tests revealed that MultP lacked some means to predict <b>multipacting.</b> Moreover, MultP partly produced erroneous results.

40|$|Effects of {{the beam}} loss, ion and {{electron}} gas desorption on the RHIC vacuum pressure bump have been reviewed. The beam loss and ion desorption are probably not the dominant factors in the RHIC vacuum problem. On the other hand, electron desorption, given the electron <b>multipacting,</b> can cause serious vacuum problem. In general, the electron <b>multipacting</b> was not predicted for the RHIC according to the present understanding of the mechanism. However, beam loss created ions can extend electron lifetime during the bunch gap, and electron <b>multipacting</b> becomes possible at the RHIC. Also, the pres-sure rise in the RHIC Gold beam run was much worse than the usual electron cloud induced vacuum pressure rise, which was observed in many machines. One possibility is that the beam loss created ions have raised the electron density saturation limit and, therefore, con-tributed to further pressure rise.

A programme of studies has been launched since 1999 to study the electron cloud build-up and related instabilities in the SPS and in the PS for the LHC and fixed target beams. The experimental tools and analysis developed so far are presented together with the results of the observations. The countermeasures applied in the PS Complex & SPS against the electron cloud instability are also briefly discussed...|$|E
