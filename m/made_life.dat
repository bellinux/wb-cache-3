5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game. Warlike tribes <b>made</b> <b>life</b> difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This <b>made</b> <b>life</b> easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E

5|$|James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, {{as former}} CIA Director, {{one of the}} few aware of the aliens' {{existence}} due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North. The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki, MGM's head of advertising, who <b>made</b> <b>life</b> unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of Stargate.|$|E
5|$|Stroma is now abandoned, {{with the}} houses of its former {{inhabitants}} unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually through {{the first half of}} the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma's isolation <b>made</b> <b>life</b> on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. Stroma's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze cattle and sheep.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{theme for}} the video is the Chinese legend of Houyi. The video goes on to {{introduce}} King Di-Jun, his ten sons (who are also the Celestial Suns), Queen Xi and Warrior Yi. The video shows one of the King's ten sons being strapped {{to the back of}} the jade dragon, but breaks free and the sons <b>made</b> <b>life</b> on Earth unbearable, so the King send the warrior who was introduced earlier to kill them. He succeeds in finding them, and kills all but one.|$|E

5|$|When unoccupied, the {{children}} tended {{to their own}} needs and played with toy marbles and hobby horses. Some learned to count by playing hide and seek. Play was primarily for inculcating virtuous traits like courage and loyalty, but it also <b>made</b> <b>life</b> more tolerable. Black and white children played together {{before the age of}} ten, but separated afterwards based on the demands of work. Children often helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated into full work responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, limiting their ability to participate in society, and <b>made</b> <b>life</b> difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This <b>made</b> <b>life</b> easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he <b>made</b> <b>life</b> hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, {{the island}} became the {{property}} of Istanbul University's department of Marine Life and Sea Products, which used it for lessons and research.

25|$|Lack of {{employment}} opportunities has increasingly <b>made</b> <b>life</b> in many rural regions difficult, hence the apparent enticement to resettle in urban areas.
