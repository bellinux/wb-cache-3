FCM showed {{that all of the}} <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants had two-fold fluorescence intensity values of the diploid control, indicating that they were tetraploids. SSR and CAPS were used to characterize the compositions of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes of the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants. As for SSR four primer pairs were tried and two showed polymorphisms between the fusion parents. With both primer pairs the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants encompassed DNA bands from both parents, indicating that they were heterokaryonic hybrids. Amplification with some universal primers, followed by digestion with restriction endonucleases, could distinguish the fusion parents from each other. As far as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA compositions were concerned the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants shared the same banding patterns as the embryogenic parents for all of the polymorphic primer/enzyme combinations.

In order to evaluate tetraploid inheritance in a tetraploid interspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> between mandarin and lemon, we performed segregation studies using cytogenetic and single sequence repeat molecular markers. Cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> revealed 11 % tetravalents and 76 % bivalents. Inheritance of the tetraploid hybrid was analyzed by genotyping the triploid progeny derived from a cross between a diploid pummelo and the tetraploid <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid,</b> in order to derive genotypes of the meiospores produced by the tetraploid. A likelihood-based approach was used to distinguish between disomic, tetrasomic, and intermediate inheritance models and to estimate the double reduction rate. In agreement with expectations based the cytogenetic data, marker segregation was largely compatible with tetrasomic and inheritance intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic, with some evidence for preferential pairing of homoeologous chromosomes. This has important implications for the design of breeding programs that involve tetraploid hybrids, and underscores the need to consider inheritance models that are intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic.

Tissue cultures studies were carried out in order to preserve and increase these germplasms. Somatic embryogenesis in both species was obtained and confirmed histologically. In D. cymosa, somatic embryos were induced from leaf and petiole-derived callus. The formation of abnormal embryos, with fused cotyledons, was influenced by the growth regulators used. Embryo maturation was confirmed histochemically through the identification of starch granules in the cotyledons. Regeneration was dependent on the culture media. Somatic embryogenesis in P. hexandrum was achieved through embryogenic cell suspension cultures from root-derived callus. Organogenesis via adventitious bud formation led to plant regeneration in liquid medium. Phenotypically normal plants were recovered. The regenerant showed the somatic chromosome number of 2 n= 2 x= 12, although some chromosomes were morphologically abnormal. The recalcitrance of P. hexandrum towards Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was demonstrated with different strains of both A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes. The presence of cytotoxic lignans in P. hexandrum may have a role in the inactivation of the bacteria. Aryltetralin lactone lignans isolated from rhizomes and roots of P. hexandrum and characterized by spectroscopic methods were used as standards in phytochemical studies of D. cymosa. Enzymic hydrolysis of the lignan glycosides, followed by reverse-phase HPLC, allowed the screening of lignans in leaf tissues, calli and cell suspension cultures.

Híbridos somáticos de laranja doce (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) e limão Cravo (C. limonia L. Osbeck) foram regenerados após a fusão (polietileno glicol) e cultura de protoplastos. Os híbridos somáticos foram confirmados pela análise da morfologia das folhas, determinação do número de cromossomos e marcadores moleculares (RAPD). Todas as plantas analisadas revelaram-se tetraplóides (2 n = 4 x = 36), possuíam folhas de morfologia intermediária e uma combinação do padrão de bandas de RAPD de ambos os parentais. Esta combinação pode se tornar útil como porta-enxerto para a Região Sudeste da indústria citrícola brasileira. Este híbrido somático potencialmente combinará as características de tolerância à seca e o vigor do limão Cravo com a tolerância ao declínio da laranja Caipira...|$|R
40|$|Cultivated {{and wild}} potato species {{synthesize}} {{a wide variety}} of steroidal glycoalkaloids (GAs). During breeding programs, species genomes are often put together through either sexual or somatic hybridization. Therefore, the determination of the GA composition of hybrids is very important in that it may affect either human consumption, or resistance to pathogen and pests. Here, we report the results of GA analysis performed on wild Solanum bulbocastanum, haploids of cultivated potato S. tuberosum and their interspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids.</b> GAs were extracted from tubers and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC Profile of S. tuberosum haploids showed, as expected, the presence of a-solanine and a-chaconine. The profile of S. bulbocastanum extract showed lack of a-solanine and a-chaconine, and the presence of four GAs. The GA pattern of the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> was the sum of their parents profile. This represents a noteworthy tool for their unequivocal recognition. Interestingly, two hybrids produced not only GAs of both parents but also new compounds to be further investigated. This provided evidence that somatic hybridization induced the synthesis of new metabolites. The nature of the probable unidentified GAs associated to S. bulbocastanum and its <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> was ascertained by chemical degradation and spectroscopic analysis of their aglycones and sugar moieties. Our results suggest their close relation with GAs of both wild and cultivated potato species...|$|R
40|$|Summary Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance in sexual hybridiza-tion, plant somatic hybridization allows transfer, mixing and recombination of cytoplasmic genomes. In {{addition to the}} use of somatic hybridization in plant breeding programs, applica-tion of this unique tool should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the roles played by the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes in determining agronomically important traits. The nucleotide sequences of cytoplasmic genomes are much more conserved than those of nuclear genomes. Cytoplasmic DNA composition in <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> is commonly elucidated either by length polymorphism analysis of restricted genome regions amplified with universal primers (PCR-RF) or by hybridiza-tion of total DNA using universal cytoplasmic probes. In this study, we demonstrate that single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a powerful, quick and easy alternative method for cytoplasmic DNA characterization of <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids,</b> especially for mitochondrial DNA. The tech-nique allows detection of polymorphisms based on both size and sequence of amplified targets. Twenty-two species of the subfamily Aurantioideae were analyzed with eight universal primers (four from chloroplastic and four from mitochondrial regions). Differences in chloroplastic DNA composition were scored in 98 % of all possible two-parent combinations, and dif-ferent mitochondrial DNA profiles were found in 87 % of them. Analysis by SSCP was also successfully used to characterize <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> and cybrids obtained by fusion of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. and C. excelsa Wester protoplasts...|$|R

40|$|Segregation of {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci was monitored {{to determine the}} degree of homeologous pairing and recombination in a hexaploid <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid,</b> A 206, the result of protoplast fusion between Solanum tuberosum (PI 203900, a tetraploid cultivated potato) and Solanum brevidens (PI 218228), a diploid, sexually incompatible, distant relative harboring several traits for disease resistance. <b>Somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> A 206 was crossed to Katahdin, a tetraploid potato cultivar, to generate a segregating population of pentaploid progeny. Although the clones of the tetraploid S. tuberosum lines PI 203900 and Katahdin were highly polymorphic, the diploid S. brevidens clone was homozygous at all but two of the tested RFLP loci. Thus, homeologous recombination could be detected only when S. tuberosum and S. brevidens chromosomes paired and the S. brevidens homologs then segregated into separate gametes. A bias toward homologous pairing was observed for all 12 chromosomes. At least four and perhaps six chromosomes participated in homologous pairing only; each of 24 progeny contained all S. brevidens-derived RFLP markers for chromosomes 4, 8, 9 and 10. The remaining six chromosomes paired with their homolog(s) about twice as often as expected if hexaploid pairings were completely random. Where detectable with RFLPs, homeologous recombinations (both single and double) occurred at a frequency of 1. 31 per chromosome. Cytological observations of meiosis I in the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> indicated that homeologous pairing had occurred. Enhanced recombinational activity was observed for chromosome 2. A specific small deletion from chromosome 4 was detected in A 206 and 11 other <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> out of 14 screened. These hybrids represent 13 independent fusion events between the same clones of S. brevidens and S. tuberosum. In one instance, this deletion occurred in one of two plants resulting from the same callus, indicating that the loss occurred in culture after fusion had taken place. It is possible that this deletion contributes to somaclonal variation...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome spatial {{arrangements}} on metaphase {{plates of}} intergeneric intertribal cell hybrids of Nicotiana chinensis and Atropa belladonna {{as well as}} interspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and Nicotiana sylvestris were analyzed. In the metaphases of the first divisions of protoplast fusion products, chromosomes of the two parents were spatially separated (segmented metaphase). In long-term cultured <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids,</b> the topology of genome separation pattern in both callus cells and plants showed changes in form from “segmental” to “radial. ” Growing the hybrid cells {{in the presence of}} colchicine resulted in random chromosome arrangement both in cells directly exposed to different colchicine concentrations and in colchicine-treated cells grown in colchicine-free media. The degree of genome separation calculated for different cell clones remained constant during in vitro propagation of cells but was significantly lower for subclones derived from colchicine-treated cells. Therefore, it is concluded that spatial chromosome arrangement in metaphase is epigenetically controlled...|$|R
