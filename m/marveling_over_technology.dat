With the hope {{this could be the}} end of their captive journey, the Moonbase Alpha staff assigns the planet the code-name 'Terra Nova'—New Earth. As per {{the first phase of the}} Operation Exodus colonisation protocol, Eagle One is sent on a low-altitude reconnaissance. While the staff awaits its return, preliminary data from the on-board computer is processed and confirms the planet has unlimited resources to sustain human life. Astronauts Parks and Bannion check in, <b>marveling</b> <b>over</b> the planet's similarity to Earth; with no sign of intelligent life, it seems to be waiting just for them.|$|R

He requests to know what she is searching for, to which Chitra coyly replies that she is seeking the man of her desires. The two go back and forth until Chitra admits that she is looking for him, which prompts Arjuna to say that he will no longer hold to his vows of chastity. Chitra finds that rather than make her happy, hearing this makes her extremely unhappy since he is not falling for her true self and tells him not to offer his heart to an illusion.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} of [...] "Who Says" [...] was mixed; though most praised the song musically, some were skeptical of Mayer's explicit reference to drug use. Crystal Bell of Billboard magazine gave a favorable review from the song, saying, [...] "'Who Says' balances Mayer's signature velvety tone {{with a more}} stripped-down, folk-inspired arrangement." [...] She added, [...] "Mayer may not be speaking in grandiose terms about changing the world or <b>marveling</b> <b>over</b> a woman's beauty, but maybe that's the point." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said of the single [...] "Mayer channels Cat Stevens, Jason Mraz, and every camp counselor you ever had on this soft-rockin' celebration of women, wild times, and getting stoned." [...] and gave the song a [...] "B".|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} my thought; I {{could have said}} it myself; and indeed it was the thought of all there present. A sort of awe crept over us, to think how that untaught girl, taken {{suddenly}} and unprepared, was yet able to penetrate the cunning devices of a King's trained advisers and defeat them. <b>Marveling</b> <b>over</b> this, and astonished at it, we fell silent and spoke no more. We {{had come to know}} that she was great in courage, fortitude, endurance, patience, conviction, fidelity to all dutiesin all things, indeed, that make a good and trusty soldier and perfect him for his post; now we were beginning to feel that maybe there were greatnesses in her brain that were even greater than these great qualities of the heart. It set us thinking.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{chairlifts}} {{were installed}} at Sun Valley, Idaho in 1936, skiers had relied on tows powered by horses or water wheels. In the early 1930s, the Canadian Alex Foster designed a towing device powered by an automobile engine. Tow ropes and bars could be dangerous, and many skiers found them unpleasant - especially on longer or steeper runs. Curran's chairlift raised skiers {{off the ground}} allowing them to rest and gain an enjoyable view of mountains, ski-runs, and resorts. “People were <b>marveling</b> <b>over</b> how well the chairlifts worked,” and it [...] "hit the sweet spot of cost and comfort," [...] said Kirby Gilbert, a ski historian. A two-person lift was introduced in 1946, followed by three and four skier models of the next twenty years. Today {{it is difficult to}} separate the experience of recreational skiing from riding chairlifts.|$|R
60|$|Long {{after the}} lights were out and the low hum of voices had ceased round the camp-fire Duane lay wide awake, eyes staring into the blackness, <b>marveling</b> <b>over</b> the strange events of the day. He was humble, {{grateful}} to {{the depths of his}} soul. A huge and crushing burden had been lifted from his heart. He welcomed this hazardous service to the man who had saved him. Thought of his mother and sister and Uncle Jim, of his home, of old friends came rushing over him {{the first time in years}} that he had happiness in the memory. The disgrace he had put upon them would now be removed; and in the light of that, his wasted life of the past, and its probable tragic end in future service as atonement changed their aspects. And as he lay there, with the approach of sleep finally dimming the vividness of his thought, so full of mystery, shadowy faces floated in the blackness around him, haunting him as he had always been haunted.|$|R

Over the last decade most schools in developed countries around the world, ranging from pre to secondary schools have adopted the Computer Based Education systems (CBL) for their students.

This comprehensive study reviews previous research based on two basic categories technology adoption by teachers and students and personality in terms of technology adoption. Based on past studies a hypothesis has been developed to determine the influences between them.
