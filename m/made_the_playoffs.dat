5|$|After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> {{for nine}} {{straight}} seasons. They won five straight AFC South titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009, {{the first time}} that has been achieved in the NFL's 90-year history. Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning {{home run}} {{was the only}} hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martínez, who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against a Yankee team ever. Martínez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, {{including}} striking out eight of the final nine batters. The teams finished first and second in their division and both <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees did {{not reach}} the World Series in 1997, but came back {{with one of the}} better seasons in {{baseball}} history in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series.

5|$|Adams {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of becoming {{a free agent after}} the 2007 season, but he resigned with the Roughriders by February 2008. Adams was challenged by Brent Curvey and Ronald Flemons in training camp, but he won the starting role for the 2008 season. Playing in 14 games, he made 11 tackles and two fumble recoveries.

5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach.

They did not appear in the Finals in this time and only won one of the three series they appeared in, beating the Atlanta Flames two games to none in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Both teams <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in 2009. During the ALDS, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Minnesota Twins {{to face the}} Angels who had knocked out the Red Sox at Fenway after being one strike away from losing Game 3, and rallying against Papelbon to take the division series in 3 games. The Yankees beat the Angels and went on defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series, 4–2, to earn their 27th World Series title and their first championship {{in their first year}} in the new Yankee Stadium.

However, the city of Boston would see more success when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX, {{three months after the}} Red Sox won the World Series, giving the greater Boston area its third championship in 12 months, making it the first time since 1980 that any city had two Super Bowl winners and a World Series winner in a period of the same length.|$|E

Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. They <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.|$|E
5|$|Fassel was {{replaced}} by current coach Tom Coughlin who has coached the team since 2004, also to inconsistent results and media scrutiny. The Giants acquired their current starting quarterback Eli Manning via a draft day trade from the San Diego Chargers. Manning had been the quarterback at University of Mississippi, {{and was the first}} pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. During this period standout Giants players include defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record in rushing yards in 2005. The Giants <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> four consecutive seasons, from 2005–2008 (including a Super Bowl victory during the 2007 season), but missed the playoffs in 2009 and 2010.|$|E

The team still <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers (eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993), before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6, a double-overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995. Again he {{struggled}} with injury, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list once for tendinitis in his right shoulder and once for a strained rib cage muscle. In his only year with the club, Jackson posted a team-best 2.39 ERA, while recording 41 strikeouts over 40 games.

5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs.</b> Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.|$|E

50|$|Oklahoma <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoff</b> in <b>the</b> 2015 season, {{and many}} experts {{expected}} them to compete for another playoff berth. However, much like Auburn, the Sooners started 1-2, with both losses coming against nationally-ranked opponents.
