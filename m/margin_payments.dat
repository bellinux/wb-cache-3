5000|$|The county's {{finances}} {{were not}} suspect until February 1994. The Federal Reserve Bank began to raise US interest rates, causing many securities in Orange County's investment pools {{to fall in}} value. As a result, dealers were requesting extra <b>margin</b> <b>payments</b> from Orange County. These extra <b>margin</b> <b>payments</b> were {{funded in part by}} another bond issue made by Orange County; the size of that bond issue was $600 million. However, this fix proved to be only temporary. In December 1994, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) realized {{what was going on and}} blocked the [...] "rolling over" [...] of $1.25 billion in repos ("rollover" [...] essentially means issuing another repo when the previous one ends, but at the new prevailing interest rate). At that point some claim that Orange County was left with no recourse other than to file for bankruptcy. [...] Others would argue that Orange County's decision to enter bankruptcy protection was voluntary.|$|E

50|$|The second {{question}} concerns {{the nature of}} controls. Capital controls can either be structured as detailed microeconomic interventions (e.g. specialised rules about <b>margin</b> <b>payment</b> by foreign investors trading on exchanges) or they can be structured as macroeconomic instruments (e.g. an unremunerated reserve requirement, that discourages short-term flows). Both these alternatives have strengths and weaknesses.|$|R

The five-year Farm Bill contains significant changes that will affect farmers and ranchers throughout the country. The main program in the new Farm Bill that affects dairy producers is the Dairy Margin Protection Program (MPP). This is a new risk management program providing dairy producers with <b>margin</b> protection <b>payments</b> during times when their income <b>margin</b> (milk <b>payment</b> minus feed cost) falls below the protected margin coverage level. The purpose of this Washington State University manual is to describe the MPP and how it functions based on current program definitions, as well as its implications for Washington dairy farms...|$|R
50|$|Using {{the hidden}} five-eights account, Leeson began to aggressively trade in futures and options on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. His {{decisions}} routinely resulted in losses of substantial sums, {{and he used}} money entrusted to the bank by subsidiaries for use in their own accounts. He falsified trading records in the bank's computer systems, and used money intended for <b>margin</b> <b>payments</b> on other trading. As a result, {{he appeared to be}} making substantial profits. However, his luck ran out when the Kobe earthquake sent the Asian financial markets—and with them, Leeson's investments—into a tailspin. Leeson bet on a rapid recovery by the Nikkei, which failed to materialize.|$|E

Gupta, Division Chief SEBI and Co-ordinator of the Group while {{providing}} outstanding administrative support {{did not participate}} in the deliberations of the group and in the drafting of the report. Executive Summary This Executive Summary highlights the principal recommendations of the Group (majority view). As explained in his note of dissent, Dr. R. H. Patil does not concur with some of these recommendations. The group recommends several significant changes in the Revised Carry Forward System (RCFS). The system emerging from these modifications is referred to below as the Modified Carry Forward System (MCFS). The Group recommends abolition of the twin track system of segregating carry forward trades and delivery trades. A uniform margin of 10 % on gross positions with daily marking to market should be applied to both types of transactions. <b>Margin</b> <b>payments</b> to the exchange must be value dated the same day. Over a period of time, exchanges must move towards realization of <b>margin</b> <b>payments</b> before the next day’s trading begins. As a precondition for adopting the MCFS, an exchange should have a well designed software for margin computation and well established governance structures and administrative infrastructure for monitoring and enforcing the margining system...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we examine}} {{a problem of}} convex {{stochastic}} optimal control applied to mathematical finance. The goal is to maximize the expected utility from wealth at close of trade (or terminal wealth) under a regime switching model. The presence of regime switching constitutes a definite challenge, {{and in order to}} keep the analysis tractable we therefore adopt a market model which is in other respects quite simple, and in particular does not involve <b>margin</b> <b>payments,</b> inter-temporal consumption or portfolio constraints. The asset prices will be modeled by classical Ito processes, and the market parameters will be dependent on the underlying Brownian Motion as well as a finite-state Markov Chain which represents the "regime switching" aspect of the market model. We use conjugate duality to construct a dual optimization problem and establish optimality relations between (putative) solutions of the dual and primal problems. We then apply these optimality relations to two specific types of utility functions, namely the power utility and logarithmic utility functions, and for these utility functions we obtain the optimal portfolios in completely explicit and implementable form...|$|E
40|$|New Product Introduction (NPI) {{activity}} has considerably increased due to ever shortening product life cycles. Therefore, cash flow management {{is a vital}} part of NPI, and is based on the cumbersome equation of customers, demand development, product <b>margin,</b> <b>payment</b> programmes, supply lead times and assembly duration. Until today cash flow management of this whole system has been completed with rather primitive methods (e. g., spreadsheets or 'rule of thumb'). However, these alternatives have barely been able to show the most negative cash flow point, or sensitivity of it. In this paper we will introduce a system dynamics model incorporating all of the important elements, which will have an effect on cash flow management of early life cycle products. Based on this, methods to improve cash positions, and also manage cash flow as volumes grow and new investments are needed are being proposed. System dynamics simulation gives more support for e-finance based management, as opposed to inflexible spreadsheet models. supply chain management; SCM; cash flow management; early life cycle products; new product introduction; NPI; system dynamics models; e-finance; electronic finance. ...|$|R

A naïve expectations model was specified, with the results indicating that direct payments are decoupled; however, counter-cyclical are not. Overall, the results indicate that a change in the expected gross <b>margin</b> or counter-cyclical <b>payments</b> would stimulate a supply response in rice production. The lack of a significant amount of time-series data renders results of this analysis as preliminary. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Chile's {{success with}} pension {{reform in the}} early 1980 s and the {{continuing}} financial pressures facing the social security systems of many developing (and some industrial) countries have elicited considerable interest in the mechanics of pension systems {{that are based on}} fully funded individual capitalization accounts. The author sets out the simple(r) algebra of both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. The author notes the following results: (a) unless the real rate of interest exceeds the growth rate of real wages by a significant <b>margin,</b> <b>payment</b> of a reasonable pension rate requires a high contribution rate or a high active worklife ratio (the ratio of working life to retirement life); (b) it is more difficult for a high-growth economy to provide a high pension rate, although the absolute level of the pension could be higher than the pension level in a low-growth economy with a high pension rate; (c) when pensions are indexed to prices, the level of interest rates and growth rates affects positively the level of the pension rate. But when pensions are indexed to wages, only the difference between interest rates and growth rates has an effect on pension rates. In all cases, the active worklife ratio has a positive effect on the pension rate; (d) the timing of contributions, and therefore the pattern of earnings over a person's full career, has a significant but not major effect on pension rates; (e) employer-based, final-salary, defined-benefit plans penalize early leavers and favor late high-fliers; (f) full funding with universal coverage and full lifetime careers would lead to a massive accumulation of capital, especially if the demographic structure resembles a pillar rather than the more traditional pyramid. This would have major implications for the productivity of capital and the functioning of financial systems; (g) a mixed system [...] combining a redistributive first pillar and a fully funded defined-contribution second pillar [...] represents a more prudent, perhaps more equitable, approach to reforming pension systems; (h) variable contribution and pension rates, within specified limits, might be preferable and more consistent with greater reliance on personal choice.

40|$|How best to {{optimize}} the biodiversity gain from agri-environment schemes (AES) has recently {{been identified as a}} key policy-relevant question. Here, the effects of two features of lowland agricultural landscapes on the abundance and diversity of larger moths are contrasted. Although both features bring about positive effects, hedgerow trees have a larger impact than 6 m wide grassy field <b>margins.</b> Whilst AES <b>payments</b> are given to create and maintain grass margins, no financial reward is currently offered for the retention of hedgerow trees. Furthermore, it was only in areas where the amount of land under AES was experimentally increased, by targeting farmers, that the presence of hedgerow trees resulted in a substantially higher abundance (+ 60 %) and diversity (+ 38 %) of moths. Thus, by using larger moths as bio-indicators of landscape-scale quality, it is demonstrated that improvements to the cost-effectiveness of AES could be achieved, firstly, by providing more appropriate financial rewards to farmers for different landscape features, and secondly, through landscape-scale targeting of farmers to encourage participation in AES. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Dr. Richard Boisvert, Dr. Timothy MountThis thesis {{identifies}} {{the conditions under}} which and quantifies how much society gains from integrating demand response directly into wholesale electricity markets and the level of participation that will bring about these improvements. Furthermore, it {{identifies the}} conditions under which the bulk power system is made more reliable through the participation of demand response and the inducements necessary to achieve this improvement. To accomplish these goals, an econometric representation of New York's wholesale electricity markets' supply curves is developed in order to understand exactly how changes in load affect price. Economic demand response is very sensitive to locational differences in the bulk power system. The simulations undertaken illustrate how a significant amount of demand response is needed in Western NY to generate a positive change in net social welfare, under rather extreme conditions, whereas very little must be relied upon in New York City and Long Island, under much more reasonable circumstances. From a reliability standpoint, demand response can {{play a vital role in}} accurately maintaining reserve <b>margins</b> provided the <b>payment</b> or tariff rate is allowed to fluctuate given the quantity of reserves needed. When a fixed rate is instead used, the reliability benefits from load curtailments are almost always less than the costs to achieve them...|$|R
