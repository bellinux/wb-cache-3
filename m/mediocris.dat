5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, <b>mediocris,</b> congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus <b>mediocris</b> {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
25|$|More general airmass {{instability}} in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds. A cumulus cloud initially forms in {{the low level of}} the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species humilis that shows only slight vertical development. If the air becomes more unstable, the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species <b>mediocris,</b> then congestus, the tallest cumulus species which is the same type that the International Civil Aviation Organization refers to as 'towering cumulus'.|$|E
25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus <b>mediocris</b> produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E
500|$|The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature pannus (also called scud) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus <b>mediocris</b> clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus". The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise {{any of the four}} species of cumulus.|$|E

The spot had caught Marden's eye in 1944 {{when he and}} his wife and had been fishing for hickory shad (Alosa <b>mediocris)</b> along the Potomac, near Chain Bridge.

2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the <b>mediocris</b> and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
