5|$|Students {{living on}} campus occupy a {{dormitory}} {{referred to as}} the , although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students <b>must</b> <b>live</b> alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) <b>must</b> <b>live</b> in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E

The Roman military commander, Corbulo, campaigned successfully against the Germanic tribes, For the Chauci and for the Frisii this meant Roman occupation, with the Romans specifying where they <b>must</b> <b>live,</b> with a fort built among them, and forcing a Roman-style senate, magistrates, and constitution upon them.|$|E

25|$|Alongside populism, Herzen is also {{remembered for}} his {{rejection}} of corrupt government of any political persuasion {{and for his}} support for individual rights.

Herzen found greater understanding by not committing himself to an extreme but rather lived impartially enabling him to equally criticise competing ideologies. Herzen believed that grand doctrines ultimately result in enslavement, sacrifice and tyranny.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those whom}} the early Theosophists claimed as Masters were Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus, Asian {{religious}} figures like Gautama Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi, and modern individuals like Jakob Bohme, Alessandro Cagliostro, and Franz Mesmer.

According to Theosophical belief, the Masters approach those deemed worthy to embark on an apprenticeship or chelaship. The apprentice would then undergo several years of probation, during which they <b>must</b> <b>live</b> a life of physical purity, remaining chaste, abstinent, and indifferent to physical luxury.|$|E
