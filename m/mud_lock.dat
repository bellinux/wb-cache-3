50|$|The Cold Springs <b>Mud</b> <b>Lock,</b> {{constructed}} in 1828, is located {{next to the}} old Erie Canal near a stone dust trail {{that leads to a}} small bridge over the lock. The <b>Mud</b> <b>Lock</b> was originally built out of wood, however, was rebuilt in 1836 using stone. The current lock was constructed by the Work relief program in the 1930s. At that time, the footbridge was also added.|$|E
50|$|The Wegmans Good Dog Park was {{the first}} of its kind in Central New York and is located in theCold Springs <b>Mud</b> <b>Lock</b> section of Onondaga Lake Park. It is open from sunrise to sunset, seven days a week year round.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>Lock</b> [...] - [...] A dam and canal {{lock on the}} Cayuga-Seneca Canal at {{the north}} end of Cayuga Lake {{maintaining}} the lake level of Cayuga Lake, in the northwest part of the town on NY-90. The Cayuga-Seneca Canal system connects the two Finger Lakes to the Erie Canal.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{the armies}} of the eponymous bastards, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), face off in a battle for control of Winterfell. The Bolton army defeats most of Jon's force, mostly {{composed}} of Wildlings. Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) arrives with Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen) and the Knights of the Vale who defeat the remaining Bolton army. Ramsay retreats to Winterfell, where Jon beats him into the <b>mud,</b> <b>locks</b> him in the kennels and Sansa feeds him to his hounds. In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) refuses to surrender to the Masters, mounts Drogon and begins burning the Masters' fleet; this forces them to surrender. Yara (Gemma Whelan) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) arrive in Meereen and offer their ships to Daenerys, swearing to help her take the Seven Kingdoms.|$|R
5000|$|Swerve and Avoid: The drivers {{practice}} swerving {{on three}} varying surfaces: mud, gravel, and coated asphalt. Jodi is convinced she failed all three, but actually passed the asphalt (and {{was the only}} driver to do so), while Shannon is the only driver to pass the mud portion. Shannon, however, fishtails horribly after accidentally putting too much gas when attempting to swerve on gravel, although Sean and Michael do so successfully. Henrietta fails all three tests, but worst of all was Colin: it appeared upon closer inspection that he intentionally failed all three courses - he swerved with only {{one hand on the}} wheel in <b>mud,</b> <b>locked</b> up his brakes on gravel, and accelerated when told to brake on the asphalt, causing him to hit the boxes with enough force to shatter the car's windshield.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But you haven't it, Nelly,' {{retorted}} the dwarf, 'and won't have it, and can't have it, until I {{have been}} home, {{so you see}} that to do your errand, you must go with me. Reach me yonder hat, my dear, and we'll go directly.' With that, Mr Quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off the desk until his short legs touched the ground, when he got upon them {{and led the way}} from the counting-house to the wharf outside, when the first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature, rolling in the <b>mud</b> together, <b>locked</b> in a tight embrace, and cuffing each other with mutual heartiness.|$|R
50|$|The {{water level}} is {{regulated}} by the <b>Mud</b> <b>Lock</b> {{at the north end}} of the lake. It is connected to Lake Ontario by the Erie Canal and Seneca Lake by the Seneca River. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.|$|E
40|$|Sharply angular {{boulders}} {{as large}} as 320 kg sit on the Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, California; trails leading to them indicate that the rocks have moved large distances. The process has never been witnessed. Although high winds and a wetted surface seem necessary, controversy persists {{about the need for}} other conditions, especially ice sheets. On the basis of experiments with a wetted Racetrack surface (soft mud ∼ 3 cm deep), we find the effective coefficient of friction to be surprisingly high, ∼ 0. 8. Movement by wind alone of moderate-sized (20 kg) rocks with cubic shape requires sustained winds close to the ground of ∼ 80 m/s (∼ 180 mph). Larger flat-lying rocks require much higher winds. To assess the ice-sheet hypothesis, we mapped a large number of tracks into a precise coordinate system with an electronic theodolite. Certain tracks, separated by 3 ̆c 1 to ∼ 830 m, have nearly identical curving patterns near their starts. The distance between a distinctive bend on one such track and its mate on another matches the distance for another mated pair of bends on these same tracks within several centimetres, even for tracks 830 m apart. As proposed by Stanley (1955), it seems that the rocks, resting on <b>mud,</b> were <b>locked</b> into a single floating ice sheet, in this case at least 850 X 500 m. Final resting places of these rocks are much more widely scattered than their starting points, suggesting that the sheet broke into smaller plates. Large ice sheets can move rocks even with light winds and may explain the gentle curvature of tracks hundreds of metres long, a pattern very unlikely with gusty high winds and no ice...|$|R
