50|$|The general {{principle}} behind morpheme order is the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> (first formulated by Baker 1985), {{according to which}} the linear order of morphemes is the {{mirror image of the}} hierarchy of syntactic projections. For example, in a plural noun like cat-s, the plural morpheme is higher in the hierarchy than the noun: -scat. The <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> dictates that the linear order of the plural morpheme with respect to the noun should be the mirror image of their hierarchy, namely the attested cat-s. The syntactic mechanism responsible for the effects of the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> is head movement: heads raise and left-adjoin to higher heads. Moreover, head movement is subject to the Head Movement Constraint, according to which when a head moves, it cannot skip an intervening head. Left adjunction and the Head Movement Constraint ensure that the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> holds.|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{to mirror}} theory is the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> of the Distributed Morphology {{framework}} that deals primarily {{with issues of}} affix ordering. In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually [...] "leaves" [...] on a syntactic tree. These syntactic [...] "leaves" [...] undergo operations {{that lead to the}} build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The <b>mirror</b> <b>principle</b> surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation with the root of a given word merging lower than all subsequent suffixes that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope; morphemes that have scope over other parts of a words. To generate the proper linear structure, Left-Head Movement is applied recursively to include the morphemes that c-command a given root.|$|E

50|$|Research {{subsequent}} to Baker (1985) {{has shown that}} there are some apparent violations to the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> and that there are more operations involved in the determination of the final linear order of morphemes. Firstly, the left adjunction requirement of head movement has been relaxed, as right adjunction {{has been shown to be}} possible (Harley 2010 among others). Therefore, different heads can have a specification for right vs. left adjunction. We could imagine, for example, that there is a language in which head movement of the noun to the Number head is specified for right adjunction, rather than left adjunction which is the case in English. In that language, the predicted order of the noun and plural morpheme would then be s-cat. Notice, however, that right vs. left adjunction determines whether an affix will be realized as a prefix or a suffix: its closeness to the root will still reflect hierarchical order. Let’s look at a hypothetical example to make this clear. Assuming that Tense is merged higher than Aspect, there are four possible orders for the tense and aspect morphemes with respect to the verb stem, once we allow for variation between left and right adjunction in head movement.|$|E

In particlular, the topology of the S^ 1 -fixed-point components in (E^n) and the S^ 1 -weights {{of the normal}} bundle of these components are worked out. <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle,</b> as developed by three of the current authors in the series of work [L-L-Y 1, I, II, III, IV], is a method for studying certain intersection numbers on a stable map moduli space. As an application, in <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> III, Sec 5. 4, an outline was given {{in the case of}} genus zero with target a flag manifold. The results on S^ 1 fixed points in this paper are used here to do explicit <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> computations in the case of Grassmannian manifolds. In fact, <b>Mirror</b> <b>Principle</b> computations involve only a certain distinguished subcollection of the S^ 1 -fixed-point components. These components are identified and are labelled by Young tableaus. The S^ 1 -equivariant Euler class e_S^ 1 of the normal bundle to these components is computed. A diagrammatic rule that allows one to write down e_S^ 1 directly from the Young tableau is given. From this, the aforementioned intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable maps can be worked out. Two examples are given to illustrate our method. Using our method, the A-model for Calabi-Yau complete intersections in a Grassmannian manifold can now also be computed explicitly.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{theoretical}} and practical implications of the <b>mirroring</b> <b>principle</b> {{to an understanding of}} how best to identify and sustain service brands' values. It does this through a focus on the web design aesthetics used in the web sites of small to large companies, and a comparison of these aesthetics with the preferences of target users. Web design contributes to services branding and a finding of a tendency of the majority of websites to employ what may be termed a ‘male design aesthetic’, and for men and women to have a differential preference as between the male and female design aesthetic, leads to a discussion of the appropriateness of previous service branding models. These earlier models discuss the role of internal staff in developing service branding values but neglect to consider the dissonance that may exist between the values of internal staff and the values of external customers. The article argues that only where the values of internal staff are congruent with those of external customers is it appropriate to model brand values around the preferences of internal staff. In those other cases where the brand values of internal staff do not span the complete range of aesthetic choices available, questions need to be asked about how best these external values can be reflected in the marketing and design of services targeted at customers. There are implications here for recruitment, promotion and training that are not currently reflected in existing services branding models, and which therefore, serve as an important addition to the services branding model...|$|R
40|$|The first {{paper is}} a {{literature}} review which examines how {{women with a}} learning disability experience breast and cervical cancer screening, {{as well as how}} these procedures can be made more acceptable and accessible to them. Fifteen papers are reviewed and critically appraised. Learning disabled women tend to feel anxious at the prospect of these screening tests although for some, it is said to facilitate a feeling of connectedness to a ‘sisterhood’. The presentation of a DVD may be more worthwhile than lengthy classroom interventions in increasing preparedness for screening in this population. Simple adjustments, such as having accessible information, have been shown to make the process of screening more acceptable. Researchers are encouraged to use creative outcome measures which are not knowledge based when conducting research with individuals who have learning disabilities. The second paper is an empirical study which explores what women with a learning disability think makes a good mother. Eight women with a learning disability were recruited and interviewed on a one-to-one basis. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is used to analyse the resulting data into themes. The women spoke about the variety of skills needed to make a good mother, including an ability to show love and provide sensitive discipline. Many themes <b>mirror</b> <b>principles</b> of Attachment Theory, including an appreciation of reciprocity within a mother-child relationship.
