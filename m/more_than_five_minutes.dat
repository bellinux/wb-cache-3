Due to the prospect of worsening rain and the chance that qualifying could be brought to an end by the weather at any point, the teams fought for grid positions early on, with Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo setting the fastest times. Apart from Sainz, both Manor Marussia drivers were eliminated, along with the two Sauber cars of Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr.

The seizures can be of the tonic–clonic type, with a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs, or of types that do not involve contractions, such as absence seizures or complex partial seizures. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening medical emergency particularly if treatment is delayed.|$|E
25|$|One French thrust was {{directed}} at occupying the strategic Hansel-Grund salient, east of Lobau island, which a brigade under Conroux secured towards 22:00. This allowed the French to deploy three pivoting bridges, which had been prepared in advance and on which other elements of Oudinot's II Corps began to cross. Meanwhile, further north, Colonel Sainte-Croix, aide-de-camp to Maréchal Masséna had 1,500 men of IV Corps embarked on landing craft and crossed the river, without meeting any opposition. Sainte-Croix's pontonniers then started work and, making good use of the current, managed to bridge {{the arm of the}} Danube in no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> using another pivoting bridge. This allowed Masséna's divisions to begin crossing, while the division commanded by Legrand, already on the northern bank since 2 July, made a feint towards Aspern and Essling, in a bid to divert Austrian attention from the actual crossing. Several other bridges were finalised towards 02:00, allowing the bulk of II and III Corps, with their respective artillery, cavalry and equipment trains to cross to the northern bank. Napoleon ordered the pontonniers to build three additional bridges and work continued well after dawn on 5 July, after the bulk of the Grande Armée had already crossed the river. The battle had begun.|$|E

The results of these different tests, revised and combined all together, will improve {{the prediction}} of the patients' prognosis, leading to an accurate vital and functional outcome, as they only have been studied separately so far. Anoxia is the third most frequent cause of coma, and {{the most common cause}} of post-anoxic coma in adults is the cardiac arrest. The incidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is not well known, but it is certain that cardiac arrest, {{the most common cause of}} post-anoxic coma, affects approximately 24000 to 50000 Spanish people every year, most of them occuring out of the hospital. A cardiac arrest is the abrupt cessation of normal circulation of the blood due to failure of the heart to contract effectively during systole. It is different from, but may be caused by, a heart attack or myocardial infarction, where blood flow to the still-beating heart is interrupted. Arrested blood circulation prevents delivery of oxygen to all parts of the body. Cerebral hypoxia, or lack of oxygen supply to the brain, causes victims to lose consciousness and to stop normal breathing, although agonal breathing may still occur.

40|$|Factors {{which may}} {{predispose}} to ventricular fibrillation were assessed in 48 consecutive patients who developed ventricular fibrillation outside hospital after {{the arrival of}} a mobile coronary care team. Before the initiation of ventricular fibrillation, late cycle ventricular extrasystoles were recorded in 38 patients (79 %) and R on T extrasystoles in 27 patients (56 %). R on T extrasystoles were relatively infrequent [...] an average of three occurred during a mean monitoring time of 27 minutes. Multifocal extrasystoles occurred in only three patients (6 %), consecutive extrasystoles in 14 (29 %), and self-terminating ventricular tachycardia in three (6 %). Ventricular extrasystoles occurring at <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> a <b>minute</b> were uncommon during this phase. The time from "warning arrhythmias" to the development of ventricular fibrillation in many patients was short, thus limiting the administration of antiarrhythmic agents. There was {{a significant increase in the}} heart rates recorded immediately before ventricular fibrillation when compared with those documented initially. Thus, an increase in heart rate appeared to be a predisposing factor in the initiation of ventricular fibrillation. An R on T extrasystole was the most important factor in the initiation of ventricular fibrillation: it occurred in 33 patients (69 %). In nine (19 %) ventricular tachycardia and in six (12 %) a late cycle extrasystole or idioventricular rhythm initiated ventricular fibrillation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: to {{estimate}} the incidence of dry eye, to identify risk factors and to establish a risk prediction model for its development in adult patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} of a public hospital. Method: concurrent cohort, conducted between March and June, 2014, with 230 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Data were analyzed by bivariate descriptive statistics, with multivariate survival analysis and Cox regression. Results: 53 % out of 230 patients have developed dry eye, with onset mean time of 3. 5 days. Independent variables that significantly and concurrently impacted the time for dry eye to occur were: O 2 in room air, blinking <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> times per <b>minute</b> (lower risk factors) and presence of vascular disease (higher risk factor).

Methods: This was a retrospective study of 76 patients who underwent 78 carotid endarterectomies at a referral center. Perioperative transcranial Doppler monitoring and MRI were performed before and after CEA. The types of MS that occurred during phases of surgery were analyzed and compared with MRI changes. Results: We observed a clinical stroke in one patient (1. 3 %) and ipsilateral small areas of silent ischemic change on seven postoperative MRI studies (9. 0 %). In 95 % of CEAs, MS were detected. Only those MS observed in the recovery room that occurred at a rate of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> per 15 <b>minutes</b> were associated with postoperative MRI ischemic changes (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the events preceding primary ventricular fibrillation (PVF), continuous tape recor-ding was performed in 262 patients consecutively {{admitted to the hospital}} within six hours of infarction in whom antiarrhythmic therapy was withheld. Warning arrhythmias (defined as ventricular ectopic beats oc-curring with a frequency of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> beats per <b>minute,</b> in runs, falling in the vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle or being multiformed) were registered in an equal percentage in patients who did or did not develop PVF. Immediately prior to PVF seven patients showed sinus tachycardia, 10 a sinus rate ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute and two bradycardia due to complete atrioventricular block. The ven-tricular ectopic beat initiating PVF had a late coupling interval (QR'/QT 0. 85) in 11 patients and a left bundle branch block configuration as frequent as a right bundle branch block. Conclusions: 1) Warning arrhythmias are not considered good criteria for institution of antiarrhythmic therapy in order to prevent PVF. 2) In patients with sinus rhythm there may be an association between heart rate and onset of PVF. 3) The malignancy of a ventricular ectopic beat is not determined by its coupling in-terval or its configuration.
