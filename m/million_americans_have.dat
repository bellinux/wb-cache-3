25|$|A 2003 review {{reported}} between 7 and 3,000 {{cases of}} CFS for every 100,000 adults. Ranjith reviewed the epidemiological literature on CFS {{and suggested that}} the wide variance of the prevalence estimates {{may be due to}} the different definitions of CFS in use, the settings in which patients were selected, and the methodology used to exclude study participants with possible alternative diagnoses. The Centers for Disease Control states a 2015 report estimates 836,000 to 2.5 <b>million</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> CFS but most remain undiagnosed. Approximately 250,000 people in the UK are affected with the illness according to the UK Department of Health archives.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{transplantation}} therapies, islet transplantation is also handicapped by {{the limited}} donor pool. The numbers are striking; at least 1 <b>million</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus, {{and only a few}} thousand donor pancreata are available each year. To circumvent this organ shortage problem, researchers continue {{to look for ways to}} [...] "grow" [...] islets—or at least cells capable of physiologically regulated insulin secretion—in vitro, but currently only islets from cadaveric donors can be used to restore euglycemia. Further exacerbating the problem (and unlike kidney, liver, and heart transplants, where only one donor is needed for each recipient) most islet transplant patients require islets from two or more donors to achieve euglycemia. Lastly, the current methods for islet isolation need improvement, since only about half of attempted isolations produce transplant-ready islets.|$|E
