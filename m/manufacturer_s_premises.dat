The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350.

It finds that trade liberalisation is no panacea to developing country problems. In fact, there are only minimal welfare gains largely accruing to the agricultural households. Furthermore, the importance of transfers (both government and inter-household) as well as exchange rate movements in determining differential welfare outcomes are highlighted...|$|R

When small manufacturers represent about 96 percent of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> investigation of JIT implementations in small, as well as large, manufacturers is warranted. This survey study investigates JIT implementation differences between small and large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Ten management practices that constitute the JIT concept are used to examine implementation of JIT manufacturing systems. Odds ratio were constructed to determine if an association exists between implemented versus not implemented and manufacturer size for each JIT practice. Ten changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation are also assessed and examined in the study. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationships between implementation status of each of the JIT practices and of each of the changes in performance in small and large manufacturers. The results of the study show that the frequencies of the 10 JIT management practices implemented differ between the two groups of manufacturer size, and an association exists between the JIT practices implemented and manufacturer size. Moreover, the changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation vary, depending on implementation status of specific JIT management practices and manufacturer size. empirical study, just-in-time manufacturing, performance, manufacturer size, logistic regression...|$|R

40|$|Does the Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{apply to}} private action? Does it {{apply to the}} courts? Does it apply to the common law? The Supreme Court of Canada in Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union v. Dolphin Delivery (1986) 1 has {{addressed}} {{each of these three}} fundamental questions. The facts of the case were these. Dolphin Delivery was a courier company. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represented the employees of another courier company, Purolator Courier, threatened to picket the premises of Dolphin Delivery. The purpose of the picketing was to publicize an industrial dispute between the union and Purolator. Dolphin Delivery was not a party to that dispute, thus the picketing of Dolphin Delivery 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises</b> would have been 2 ̆ 2 secondary picketing. 2 ̆ 2 Dolphin Delivery sought and obtained from the courts of British Columbia an injunction to restrain the union from picketing Dolphin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises.</b> The ground upon which the injunction was granted was that secondary picketing in the circumstances of this case would constitute the common law tort of inducing a breach of contract. There was a prohibition on secondary picketing in the B. C. Labour Code, but this statutory prohibition did not apply, because the applicable labour law was federal (in view of Purolator 2 ̆ 7 s interprovincial operations), and the Canada Labour Code was silent on secondary picketing, leaving it to be regulated by the common law. In the Supreme Court of Canada, the union argued that the injunction ought to be set aside on the ground that it limited freedom of expression, guaranteed under s. 2 (b) of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada, sitting as a seven-judge bench, held unanimously that the injunction should stand. McIntyre J., with the concurrence of Dickson C. J., Estey, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ., wrote the principal opinion, holding that the Charter did not apply to private action of the kind involved in this case.
