40|$|Trisubstituted nitrosoureas {{are very}} stable in aqueous systems. But they are potent genotoxins in Chinese hamster V 79 -E cells, if no {{exogenous}} <b>metabolizing</b> <b>system</b> is added, and {{the mechanism of}} their genotoxic and carcinogenic activity has been largely unknown. This investigation shows that the sister-chromatid-exchange (SCE) -indudng capacity of l, 3 -dimethyl- 3 -phenyl-l-nitrosourea (DMPNU) is eliminated by adding diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) or porcine liver carboxylesterase to the incubation system. These effects are caused by two different mechanisms: (i) DFP inhibits endogenous amidases existing in V 79 -E cells, thus preventing the intracellular decomposition, which means an activation; and (ii) exogenous carboxylesterase cleaves DMPNU extra-cellularly, and the genotoxic decomposition product is obviously too short-lived to reach a critical intracellular target. A second trisubstituted nitrosourea, 3, 3 -diethyl- 1 -methyl-l-nitrosourea (DEMNU), which is mainly activated by monooxygenases, but {{in the absence of}} an exogenous <b>metabolizing</b> <b>system</b> also induces SCEs in V 79 -E cells, was studied in the same way. It was found that the 'direct' genotoxicity of DEMNU may be inhibited by DFP as well, but carboxylesterase decomposes this trialklynitrosourea with a much lower efficiency than DMPNU suggesting a low substrate affinity. The SCE-inducing capacity of both compounds is strongly influenced by the presence of calf serum in the culture medium. The nature of the serum factor is still unknown. Pathways for the amidase catalysis of DMPNU and for the activation of DEMNU by mono-oxygenases and amidases are proposed and discussed with respect to the topical or systemic carcinogenicity of these agents...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Preliminary {{toxicity}} studies of BCNU in rats revealed that significant prolongations of pentobarbital hypnosis {{were associated with}} all doses employed. Investigations were undertaken to determine the underlying mechanism responsible for this observed effect. Studies on the in vitro metabolism of pentobarbital by hepatic microsomes of BCNU-treated animals demonstrated that significant impairment of enzyme activities had occurred as early as 7 days following a single dose. The effect was dose-related, and progressed through 21 days post treatment. Kinetic changes in the microsomal enzymes were characterized by a greatly diminished maximum velocity and an unaltered Michaelis constant. Repeated administrations of phenobarbital for 5 days following a single dose of BCNU greatly increased the pentobarbital metabolizing activity given on the seventh post-BCNU day. These results suggested that the observed prolongation of pentobarbital sleeptime in rats following BCNU treatment could be largely explained by impaired metabolism of the pentobarbital in these animals. The effect of BCNU on microsomal enzyme systems {{was not limited to}} pentobarbital oxidation. Inhibition of ethylmorphine Ndemethylation, hexobarbital oxidation, aniline hydroxylation and p- nitrobenzoic acid reduction were evident at 13 days after a single dose of 30 mg/kg of BCNU. The extent of inhibition was equivalent in all systems considered. Therefore, it was apparent that BCNU affected both oxidation and reduction reactions. Moreover, metabolism of both type I and type II compounds as determined by their characteristic spectral properties upon binding to microsomes was impaired. The general depression of microsomal enzyme activities resulting from BCNU treatment could not be accounted for by deficiencies of cofactors nor actual loss of the enzymes; however, the effect was found to be closely related to significant reductions of the microsomal hemoprotein, cytochrome P- 450, which is known {{to play an important role}} in the final phase of the electron transport chain. Decreases of cytochrome P- 450 levels in BCNU-treated rats were again dose-related and prolonged, as observed through 21 days post treatment. Interestingly, cytochrome b₅, the second of the two hemoproteins in liver microsomes, and total microsomal protein were not significantly affected by BCNU. Parallel temporal effects on pentobarbital metabolizing activity and levels of cytochrome P- 450 gave further evidence that the major effect of BCNU on the hepatic drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>systems</b> was specifically upon cytochrome P- 450. A seven-day starvation in rats resulted in severe impairment of oxidation of pentobarbital by liver microsomes. Alterations of enzyme kinetics, levels of cytochrome P- 450, cytochrome b₅ and total protein were equivalent to rats at 7 days following a single dose of BCNU (30 mg/kg). Despite the fact that BCNU-treated animals exhibited tremendous decreases in food consumption and severe weight losses, the effect of BCNU on drug metabolism was independent of the nutritional status of the animals. BCNU-treated rats which were force-fed with a nutritional liquid diet were capable of maintaining their body weights at the same level. Furthermore, no significant difference was noted with respect to kinetics of pentobarbital oxidation and concentrations of cytochrome P- 450 between the force-fed BCNU-treated rats and the BCNU-treated rats without the nutritional supplement. Therefore, although the same apparent effects on drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>systems</b> were observed with either starvation or BCNU treatment, they were thought to act by different mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Fluoren- 9 -ol and fluoren- 9 -one {{were used}} as model {{substrates}} to study microsomal metabolism of alcohols and carbonyl compounds. It was {{found that there was}} an oxidoreductase(s) present in the microsomalpreparation that catalyzed interconversion of this alcohol and ketone using pyndine nucleotides as cofactors. The alcohol could also be oxygenated to the ketone by microsomes and NADPH. It required molecular oxygen. This oxygenation was inhibited by SKF 525 -A and CO, suggesting the involvement of P- 450 oxygenase. Using highly purified P 450 oxygenase components, It was shown that fluoren- 9 -ol was oxygenated by the complete system to fluoren- 9 -one. Exclusion of cytochrome P 450 or fts reductase resulted In no oxygenation. Dllauroylglyceryl- 3 -phosphorylcholine was without ef-feet on the reaction. Fluoren- 9 -one, on the other hand, was reduced to fluoren- 9 -ol by NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase and NADPH. It is suggested that other alcohols and carbonyl compounds are similarly metabolized. The question of whether an alcohol can be oxygenated to its carbonyl compound by P- 450 oxygenase had been a subject of prolonged debate. The oxygenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by liver microsomes was first described by Orme-Johnson and Ziegler (I) and Lieber and DeCarli (2). The reaction was later attributed to P- 450 oxygenase. Other investigators have suggested that alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase/H 202 were exclusively responsible for hepatic ethanol oxidation (3, 4). The monograph ofa Johnson Research Foundation Colloquium on “Alcohol and Aldehyde <b>Metabolizing</b> <b>Systems</b> ” (5) best summarizes views on this subject. In brief, Lieber, Lu, Miwa, and their associates presented evidence that P- 450 oxygenase is capable of oxidizin...|$|R

Active compounds are weak direct-acting mutagens. Only derivatives bearing a nitro group on the phenyl ring linked to the oxyiminic function and lacking halogenated substituents show mutagenk activity. Metabolism by bacterial enzyme systems {{is important to the}} expression of genotoxicity. The reductive activation of nltro-benzimidazoles and nitroindoles carried out by the 'classical' nitroreductase of Salmonella, whkh is defective in TA 98 NR, is required of mutagenkity. Similarly, the 0 -acetyltransferase defective in TA 98 / 1, 8 -DNP 6 is required for the efficient production of the ultimate electrophilic nitrogen species, which react with DNA. The role of bacterial metabolism in mutation induction needs careful consideration to assess the potential risk to humans from nitrobenzimidazole and nitroindole antimycotics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenotoxic {{effects of}} Mimosa tenuifl ora (Willd.) Poir, Fabaceae, were {{investigated}} by using both micronucleus test and bacterial reverse mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA 97, TA 98, TA 100, TA 102 respectively. In respect of Ames test {{results show that}} the extract does not induce mutations in any strains of Salmonella typhimurium tested since the mutagenicity index is less than 2. In the antimutagenic effect was observed that the extract at the concentrations tested signifi cantly decreased the mutagenicity index of all strains tested which characterized the extract as antimutagenic in these conditions. In the micronucleus test in vivo, we observed that the concentrations used did not induce an increase in the frequency of micronucleus in normochromatic erythrocytes of mice. Therefore, we concluded that the extract of M. tenuiflora is not mutagenic in the absence of exogenous <b>metabolizing</b> <b>system</b> and does not induce an increase in the frequency of the micronucleus characterized as an agent not mutagenic in these conditions. Further studies of toxicity need to be made to the use of this plant in the treatment of diseases to be stimulated...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the ability of cimetidine to inhibit the oxidative metabolism and hence haemotoxicity of dapsone in vitro, using a two compartment system in which two Teflon chambers are separated by a semi-permeable membrane. Compartment A contained a drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>system</b> (microsomes prepared from human or rat liver +/- NADPH), whilst compartment B contained human red cells. Preincubation (30 min) of human liver microsomes with cimetidine (0 - 1000 microM) and NADPH prior to the addition of dapsone (100 microM) and NADPH (1 mM) resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the concentrations of dapsone hydroxylamine (from 179 +/- 47 to 40 +/- 6 ng) in compartment B. This reduction of hydroxylamine metabolite {{was reflected in the}} concentration-dependent reduction in methaemoglobin measured (from 7. 1 +/- 0. 7 to 3. 5 +/- 1. 5 %) in parallel experiments. Preincubation of microsomes with cimetidine in the absence of NADPH had no effect. The effect of cimetidine pretreatment on dapsone-dependent methaemoglobin was confirmed using microsomes prepared from a further three sources of human liver, as well as from rat liver...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{search for}} an optimal {{experimental}} model in pharmacology is recently focused on (mini) pigs as they seem not only to be an alternative source of cells and tissues for xenotherapy but also an alternative species for studies on drug metabolism in man due to similarities between (mini) pig and human drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>systems.</b> The purpose of this work is to characterize minipig liver microsomal cytochromes P 450 (CYPs) by comparing their N-terminal sequences with corresponding human orthologs. Results The microsomal CYPs exhibit similar activities to their human orthologous enzymes (CYP 3 A 4, nifedipine oxidation; 2 A 6, coumarin 7 -hydroxylation; 2 D 6, bufuralol 1 '-hydroxylation; 2 E 1, p -nitrophenol hydroxylation; and 2 C 9, tolbutamide hydroxylation). Specific minipig CYP (2 A, 2 C and 3 A) enzymes were partially purified and proteins identified by immunostaining (using antibodies against the respective human CYPs) were used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. From comparisons, {{it can be concluded}} that the sequence of the first 20 amino acids at the N-terminus of minipig CYP 2 A is highly similar to human CYP 2 A 6 (70 % identity). The N-terminal sequence of CYP 2 C shared about 50 % similarity with human 2 C 9. The results on the minipig liver microsomal CYP 3 A yielded identical data with those obtained for amino acid sequences of the pig CYP 3 A 29 showing 60 % identity with human CYP 3 A 4. Conclusions Thus, our results further support the view that minipigs may serve as model animals in pharmacological/toxicological studies with substrates of human CYP enzymes, namely, of the CYP 3 A and CYP 2 A forms. </p...|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} results {{obtained}} {{within the framework of}} an EU funded project aimed to develop and validate alternative metabolic activating systems to be used in short-term mutagenicity assays, {{in order to reduce the}} use of laboratory animals for toxicology testing. The activating systems studied were established cell lines (Hep G 2, CHEL), genetically engineered V 79 cell lines expressing specific rat cytochromes P 450, erythrocyte-derived systems, CYP-mimetic chemical systems and plant homogenates. The metabolically competent cell lines were used as indicator cells for genotoxic effects as well as for the preparation of external activating systems using other indicator cells. The following endpoints were used: micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges, mutations at the hprt locus, gene mutations in bacteria (Ames test), unscheduled DNA synthesis and DNA breaks detected in the comet assay, All metabolic systems employed activated some promutagens. With some of them, promutagens belonging to many different classes of chemicals were activated to genotoxicants, including carcinogens negative in liver S 9 -mediated assays. In other cases, the use of the new activating systems allowed the detection of mutagens at much lower substrate concentrations than in liver S 9 -mediated assays. Therefore, the alternative <b>metabolizing</b> <b>systems,</b> which do not require the use of laboratory animals, have a substantial potential in in vitro toxicology, in the basic genotoxicity testing as well as in the elucidation of activation mechanisms. However, since the data basis is much smaller for the new systems than for the activating systems produced from subcellular liver preparations, the overlapping use of both systems is recommended for the present and near future. For example, Liver S 9 preparations may be used with some indicator systems (e. g., bacterial mutagenicity), and metabolically competent mammalian cell lines may be used with other indicator systems (e. g., a cytogenetic endpoint) in a battery of basic tests...|$|R
40|$|Choline is an {{essential}} nutrient {{that seems to be}} involved {{in a wide variety of}} metabolic reactions and functions in both humans and rodents. Various pathophysiological states have been linked to choline deprivation (CD). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of CD upon biochemical, histological and metabolic alterations induced by drugs that affect hepatic functional integrity and various drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>systems</b> via distinct mechanisms. For this purpose, paracetamol (ACET) or phenobarbital (PB) were administered to male Wistar rats that were fed with standard rodent chow (normally fed, NF) or underwent dietary CD. The administration of ACET increased the serum aspartate aminotransferase levels in NF rats, while CD restricted this increase. On the other hand, ACET suppressed alkaline phosphatase levels only in CD rats. Moreover, CD prevented the PB-induced increase of the mitotic activity of hepatocytes. The administration of ACET down-regulated CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 B 1 expression in CD rats, while up-regulating them in NF rats. The administration of PB suppressed CYP 1 A 2 apoprotein levels in CD rats, whereas the drug had no effect on NF rats. The PB-induced up-regulation of CYP 2 B, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 1 A 1 isozymes was markedly higher in CD than in NF rats. In addition, PB increased glutathione-S-transferase activity only in CD rats. Hepatic glutathione content (GSH) was suppressed by ACET in NF rats, whereas the drug increased GSH in CD rats. Our data suggest that CD has a significant impact on the hepatic metabolic functions, and in particular on those related to drug metabolism. Thus, CD may modify drug effectiveness and toxicity, as well as drug-drug interactions, particularly those related to ACET and PB...|$|R
