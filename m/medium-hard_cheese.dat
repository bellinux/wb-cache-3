Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as [...] "eyes". Swiss cheese without eyes is known as [...] "blind". (The term is applied to cheeses of this style made outside Switzerland, such as Jarlsberg cheese, which originates in Norway).|$|E
