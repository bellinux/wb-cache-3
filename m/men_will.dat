5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue <b>men</b> <b>will</b> attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

Of course, I don't know that any of these <b>men</b> <b>will</b> apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E

Applying this theory to the situation of the African-Americans, Douglass remarks: [...] "Give the negro fair play and let him alone. If he lives, well. If he dies, equally well. If he cannot stand up, let him fall down." [...] (p557) ...|$|R

25|$|More than 80% of <b>men</b> <b>will</b> develop {{prostate}} cancer {{by the age}} of 80. However, in the majority of cases, it will be slow-growing and harmless. In such men, diagnosing {{prostate cancer}} is overdiagnosis—the needless identification of a technically aberrant condition that will never harm the patient—and treatment in such men exposes them to all of the adverse effects, with no possibility of extending their lives.|$|E
