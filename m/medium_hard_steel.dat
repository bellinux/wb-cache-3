50|$|The {{standards}} for armor-piercing rifle bullets aren't clear-cut, because the penetration of a bullet {{depends on the}} hardness of the target armor. However, {{there are a few}} general rules. For example, bullets with a soft lead-core and copper jacket are too easily deformed to penetrate hard materials, whereas rifle bullets manufactured with very hard core materials, like tungsten carbide, are designed for maximum penetration into hard armor. Most other core materials would have effects between lead and tungsten carbide. Many common bullets, such as the 7.62Ã—39mm M43 standard cartridge for the AK-47 rifle, have a steel core with hardness rating ranging from Rc35 mild steel up to Rc45 <b>medium</b> <b>hard</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the game}} is paused players can scroll across the playing area, but places not under their control will not display enemy {{buildings}} and unit commands may not be issued. There are three difficulty levels - easy, <b>medium</b> and <b>hard.</b> <b>Steel</b> Soldiers has no tutorial, however the CD-ROM contains a 59-page game manual. The background music was designed to heighten the game's intensity. The game has a high score table {{and the ability to}} load and save games. There are options for changing the screen resolution, a gamma correction level setting and mouse sensitivity sliders. A free single-player demo is available for download. Skirmish mode is a customisable secondary play mode based on a series of separate maps to the missions. Multiplayer games occur on another twenty additional maps.|$|R

A mathematical model will also developed to determine the surface roughness in terms of machining time and cutting tool wear function in terms of the four independent variables: the cutting depth (d), the cutting feed (f), the cutting speed (Vc) and the cutting duration (t). The results application of MQL technique will significantly helps to obtain better performance in compare to dry condition. The purpose of cutting fluid in a machining operation is to cool the work piece, reduce friction, and wash away the chips. The cutting fluid contributes significantly toward machining cost and also possesses environmental threats...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in shot peening technology {{have resulted in}} the development of a two stage process to maximize the beneficial surface residual stresses induced in hardened, carburized steel, such as SAE 8620, a material commonly used for gears. Steel samples with an effective case depth of 0. 72 mm (0. 029 in) were used. Shot peening conditions investigated included: a) single shot peening with: regular hardness steel shot (HKC 45 - 55), <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> shot (HRC 55 - 62), and b) dual peening, first with <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> shot followed by either smaller diameter <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> shot at a lower intensity, or smaller diameter glass beads at lower intensities.

40|$|Hardness {{of water}} had {{significant}} effect on the acute toxicity of cadmium to common carp, Cyprinus carpio. The 96 h LC sub(50) and safe application rate increased from 43. 17 and 22. 77 mg 1 super(- 1) in soft water (0. 9 mM Ca super(2 +) l super(- 1)) to 310. 48 and 177. 66 mg l super(- 1), respectively, in very hard water (6. 0 mM Ca super(2 +) l super(- 1)). In <b>medium</b> <b>hard</b> and hard water, 96 h LC sub(50) values were 48. 39 and 116. 45 mg l super(- 1). When sediments were included in the <b>medium</b> <b>hard,</b> hard and very hard water treatments, the 96 h LC sub(50) were 111. 20, 133. 71 and 334. 47 mg l super(- 1), respectively. Among these values, the one for <b>medium</b> <b>hard</b> water with sediment treatment was significantly higher than <b>medium</b> <b>hard</b> water treatment; values for the other two treatments were non-significant when compared with respective water treatments. Sediment was able to reduce the acute toxicity of cadmium mainly due to the complexation of cadmium with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). At the lower hardness level, cadmium complexed with DOC and the acute toxicity was reduced significantly. At higher hardness, most of the DOC sites were occupied by calcium and the acute toxicity of cadmium was not significantly reduced in hard water with sediment and very hard water with sediment experiments in comparison to respective water treatments...|$|R

50|$|Before the mid 19th {{century when}} cheap mild steel became {{available}} due to {{new methods of}} steelmaking, knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a strip of steel on to the piece of iron {{that was to be}} formed into a knife, or sandwiching a strip of steel between two pieces of iron. This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes laminated, but for a different reason. Since the <b>hardest</b> <b>steel</b> is brittle, a layer of <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service.|$|R

50|$|The common blacksmith's anvil is made {{of either}} forged or cast steel, forged wrought iron with a <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> face or cast iron with a <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> face. Cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are {{incapable}} of {{standing up to the}} impact and will crack and dent. Also, cast iron anvils without a <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> face do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith. Historically, some anvils have been made with a smooth top working face of hardened steel welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body, though this manufacturing method is no longer in use. At one end, the common smith's anvil has a projecting conical bick (beak, horn) used for hammering curved work pieces. The other end is typically called the heel. Occasionally, the other end is also provided with a bick, partly rectangular in section. Most anvils made since the late 18th century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools, such as the anvil-cutter or hot chisel, can be inserted and held by the anvil. Some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes, to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels. An anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work.|$|R
