40|$|This paper {{describes}} the economic module {{used in the}} IIASA/UNFPA <b>Mauritius</b> <b>Project.</b> The Project developed a population-development-environment (PDE) model which includes a demographic, an economic, a land use, and a water module. The economic is an input-output model, a choice which reflects the need to distinguish {{a larger number of}} economic sectors when looking at the interaction of the economy with the population and the environment. The model is set up to function for a small, open economy. It seeks a household consumption and income equilibrium, and an investment and savings-plus-loans equilibrium. It distinguishes three income groups by level of education with different consumption patterns depending on the level of income. It includes labor productivity changes resulting from a changing educational structure of the labor force...|$|E
40|$|Criteria for {{sustainable}} development in terms of managing a nation's water resources include the availability of water in required quantity and appropriate quality. This paper presents a set of water models developed for the IIASA/UNFPA <b>Mauritius</b> <b>Project</b> for use {{as an integral part}} of a system of models including demographic, economic, and land use models. The paper identifies the most important factors determining the available freshwater resources in Mauritius (climate, geology, hydrology), and presents a simple approach to modelling water supply. Based largely on Mauritian data sources, the most important components of freshwater use are also identified and a model with appropriate linkages to demographic and economic processes is presented. Next, a dynamic model of water quality in the lagoons is discussed. Finally, possibilities to test various water management strategies with the model and the related scenario development procedures are presented...|$|E

Population estimates of about 400 birds in seven subpopulations (six in the national park and one on Ile aux Aigrettes) in 2015 have resulted from Jones' leadership in the intervention, following similar methods to the <b>Mauritius</b> kestrel <b>project.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim {{to enhance}} {{economic}} co-operation by stimulating intra-regional trade and investment, synergising competitive advantages in commodities, manufacturing and services, collection, classification {{and distribution of}} data and information, establishing a network among Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries and promoting standardisation and harmonisation in data, statistics and procedures. Formed in 1997, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation (IOR-ARC) came into being thanks to a joint initiative of South Africa, India, Australia and <b>Mauritius.</b> <b>Projecting</b> an ambitious vision, {{the aim was to}} enhance economic co-operation by stimulating intra-regional trade and investment, synergising competitive advantages in commodities, manufacturing and services, collection, classification and distribution of data and information, establishing a network among Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries and promoting standardisation and harmonisation in data, statistics and procedures. Unlike organisations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the AsiaPacific Economic Co-operation Forum (APEC), the proposed IOR-ARC did not, however, rest upon an existing record of economic interaction among the foreseen members. Furthermore, the sheer diversity in geography, culture and economic development made it appear an unrealistic and unwieldy entity. Almost 15 years later, in 2012, the IOR-ARC looks set for a revival. India and Australia are back in the leading seats as Chair and Vice-Chair respectively and, from a number of quarters, both from within and external to the Indian Ocean Region, there appears to be renewed interest in its potential...|$|R
50|$|Cooperation {{between the}} two {{countries}} include cultural exchanges, trade in goods, financial assistances and capacity building in various sectors. Currently, Malaysia has assist Mauritius on its country development such as the providing of places in training centres and institutions of higher learning for students from the country under the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme (MTCP). There are currently six Malaysian companies investing in Mauritius, some of it are in the banking sector with a joint venture with the Mauritius local banks. Other Malaysian investors has keen to invest in <b>Mauritius</b> with some <b>projects</b> concentrated on the construction of textile factory, hotel, and palm oil refinery. Some agreements such as the establishment of a joint commission on economic and technical research and forging of the cultural links were also signed. Beside that, Mauritius has ready to co-operate in the trade of sugar with Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|Raine {{received}} his bachelor's degree in experimental psychology from Oxford University in 1977. He {{received his}} D.Phil. in psychology from the University of York in 1982. Raine {{spent four years}} in two high-security prisons in England working as a prison psychologist. He was appointed lecturer in Behavioural Sciences in the Department of Psychiatry at Nottingham University in 1984 and in 1986 became director of the <b>Mauritius</b> Child Health <b>Project,</b> a continuing longitudinal study of child mental health following a group of 1795 people form Mauritius {{from the age of}} three onward. Raine moved to the United States in 1987 to become assistant professor in psychology at the University of Southern California. He was promoted to associate professor in 1990 and became the associate chair of the Psychology Department. In 1994 he was promoted to professor of psychology, and in 1999 was given the endowed chair of Robert G. Wright Professor of Psychology. In 2007, he made the move to serve as Richard Perry University Professor of Criminology & Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. He also serves as the University's fourth Penn Integrates Knowledge professor.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, Integrated Science {{curricula}} and courses have mushroomed {{all over the}} world. Likewise the <b>Mauritius</b> Integrated Science <b>Project</b> came into existence in 1976. Implied is that this 'new' science course is also a 'better' course. Is it and can it be improved? After retracing the history of Mauritian education and showing how the education system was shackled to the powers that be, mention is made of how the wind of change started blowing over the education system. The birth of M. I. S. P is hailed; its aims and objectives are then discussed. This centres {{on the meaning of}} Integrated Science, its composition and where M. I. S. P stands with regard to it. Philosophical concerns for the nature of science, the relevance of science education as well as the social implications of science education,all these concepts are treated at length. It is the thesis of this author that if these three concerns are not taken into consideration in curriculum development work for a science course at primary and secondary education levels, then we would only be scratching the surface. In consequence, an in-depth analysis of the scientific method is called for. How far the M. I. S. P teaching approach diverges from this scientific method is then exposed. Time dichotomy between the process of science and the product of science is fully discussed. It is suggested that school science, based essentially on the product of science, despite teaching approaches to the contrary i. e guided discovery method, will do more harm than good. It is proposed that the process is the all important factor in science education. Learning through science rather than learning Science is upheld to be the goal of science education. Scientific thinking should predominate over scientific knowledge at the level of education under consideration. This is said to have survival value and is viewed as the Education for Tomorrow. Proposal for changes in the structure and contents of M. I. S. P is made. The implementation issue is emphasised, especially in terms of teacher training, and examinations. These two factors are considered essential to the success of M. I. S. P. Otherwise a new orthodoxy will set in...|$|R
