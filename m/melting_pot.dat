Over that time, these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and religious and ethnic influences {{have resulted in a}} culinary <b>melting</b> <b>pot.</b> Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE, {{in the days of the}} kings of ancient Israel.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were the}} {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments.

5|$|The United States is a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> {{consisting}} of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music.

5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas {{is placed in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and {{scrambled}} eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> of cultures from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E

5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from the <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger {{was born}} the second of seven sons in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco to German {{immigrants}} August Pflueger and Ottilie Quandt who had met in Los Angeles and married. Other Quandt relatives lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood, and, in 1904, the Pflueger family moved closer, to 1015 Guerrero Street in the Mission District, a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> neighborhood of blue-collar workers. At age 11, Pflueger took his first job working for a picture-framing firm near his home.|$|E
5|$|The Creoles are a {{community}} with varied non-Anglo ancestry, mostly descendant {{of people who}} lived in Louisiana before its purchase by the U.S. The Cajuns are a group of Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada.

The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun music and Creole music.|$|E
40|$|For direct {{measuring}} of {{the maximum}} gas outlet cooling temperature in the flowing core of the pebble-bed reactor AVR Juelich there were used flattened graphite spheres (moderator spheres). These spheres, also called gas temperature measuring elements, contained 34 or 68 thin wires of different metals and metalalloys,which melt reaching their melting point. The wires itselves were in little Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$ or graphite <b>melting</b> <b>pots</b> or they were melted in quartz ampules. <b>Melting</b> <b>pots</b> and ampules were admitted in a holder. The gas temperature measuring element was supplied with cooling Channels for a better cooling gas flow through the sphere. For {{the determination of the}} hold-up time of the balls in the core and and for the estimation of their way through the core the spheres were caught in a special collecting tank with a spiral chute and a counter. At the same time the behaviour of quartz under high radiation dose and under high temperatures wasinvestigated. To save time and money a new radiographic method of post-investigation was developed. With the aid of their residual activity the melted or on-melted indicators were made visible on a special film. A comparison was made for theoretical calculated and with the aid of the test balls measured temperatures...|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, decentralised frequency controllers were developed. A decentralised controller, presented in [46], regulated the set-points of {{the temperature of}} refrigerators according to the variation in frequency deviation and its power consumption was controlled. A dynamic decentralised controller was developed in [45] to change the aggregated power consumption of refrigerators in a linear relationship with a frequency change. The controller planned to abstain from influencing the primary cold supply function of refrigerators. Similar controllers were developed to provide a frequency response from industrial bitumen tanks [41] and <b>melting</b> <b>pots</b> [50].|$|R
5000|$|The Polonization {{process of}} Germans who had settled since the 13th century in Poland, in towns like Kraków ( [...] , Cracow) and Poznań (...) {{in the midst}} of Polish lands, lasted about two centuries. They {{constituted}} a patriciate which was not able to continue its isolated position without a continuation of newcomers from German lands. The Sorbs over time also assimilated German settlers in their midst, yet at the same other Sorbs were themselves assimilated by the surrounding German-speaking population. Many Central and Eastern European towns remained for some centuries multi-ethnic <b>melting</b> <b>pots.</b>|$|R
5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing <b>melting</b> <b>pot,</b> and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and <b>Melting</b> <b>Pot).</b> Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5000|$|The {{culture of}} Colombia {{lies at the}} {{crossroads}} of Latin America. Thanks partly to geography, Colombian culture has been heavily fragmented into five major cultural regions.

50|$|In Argentina, {{the word}} Tango {{seems to have}} first {{been used in the}} 1890s. In 1902 the Teatro Opera started to include tango in their balls. Initially tango {{was just one of the}} many {{available}} local dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as theatres and street barrel organs spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European immigrants. The development of Tango had influences from the cultures of several peoples that came together in these <b>melting</b> <b>pots</b> of ethnicities. For this reason Tango is often referred to as the music of the immigrants to Argentina.|$|R
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai is the financial, {{commercial}} and entertainment capital of India. It {{is also one}} of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of India's GDP and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT), and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy. The city houses important financial institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India, the SEBI and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Nuclear Power Corporation of India, Indian Rare Earths, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Atomic Energy Commission of India, and the Department of Atomic Energy. The city also houses India's Hindi (Bollywood) and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, attract migrants from all over India, making the city a <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> of many communities and cultures.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E
40|$|Power {{generation}} {{from the}} {{renewable energy sources}} is usually intermittent and uncontrollable which challenges the grid frequency stability. The smart control of loads is an effective means to mitigate the challenge. A decentralized control of heating loads [...] industrial <b>melting</b> <b>pots</b> (MPs), was developed which dynamically changes the power consumption of loads in response to grid frequency. A thermodynamic model of MPs was developed and validated based on site measurements by Open Energi.

5|$|The United States {{is often}} {{said to be a}} {{cultural}} <b>melting</b> <b>pot,</b> taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music {{can be traced back to}} specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{culture has}} been {{influenced}} by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India, Although a strong Punjabi Influence {{can be seen in}} language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a <b>melting</b> <b>pot.</b> This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. Delhi is also identified as the location of Indraprastha, the ancient capital of the Pandavas. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1200 heritage buildings and 175 monuments as national heritage sites. In the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama MasjidIndia's largest mosque built in 1656 and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sitesthe Red Fort, Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tombare located in Delhi. Other monuments include the India Gate, the Jantar Mantaran 18th-century astronomical observatoryand the Purana Qilaa 16th-century fortress. The Laxminarayan temple, Akshardham temple,Bangla Sahib the Bahá'í Lotus temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities. New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of British colonial architecture, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb {{is an example of the}} Mughal gardens style. Some regal havelis (palatial residences) are in the Old City.|$|E

50|$|Glitch hop and wonky music evolved {{following}} {{the rise of}} trip hop, dubstep and intelligent dance music (IDM). Both glitch hop and wonky music frequently reflect the experimental nature of IDM and the heavy bass featured in dubstep songs. While trip hop {{has been described as}} being a distinct British upper-middle class take on hip-hop, glitch-hop and wonky music have much more stylistic diversity. Both genres are <b>melting</b> <b>pots</b> of influence. Glitch hop contains echoes of 1980s pop music, Indian ragas, eclectic jazz and West Coast rap. Los Angeles, London, Glasgow {{and a number of other}} cities have become hot spots for these scenes, and underground scenes have developed across the world in smaller communities. Both genres often pay homage to older and more well established electronic music artists such as Radiohead, Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada as well as independent hip hop producers like J Dilla and Madlib.|$|R
