In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect is a <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E

The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert.

5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E

40|$|Men with BRCA 2 {{mutations}} {{have been}} found to be at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. There is a recent report that BRCA 2 carriers with prostate cancer have poorer survival than noncarrier prostate cancer patients. In this study, we compared survival of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation and prostate cancer <b>with</b> that of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation and prostate cancer. We obtained the age at diagnosis, age at death or current age from 182 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer from families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation and from 119 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer from families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation. The median survival from diagnosis was 4. 0 years for <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation vs 8. 0 years for <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation, and the difference was highly significant (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Association {{recommends}} that <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA>  10  ng ml− 1 undergo prostate biopsy to detect PCa. 7 However, <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA of higher than 10 ng ml− 1, {{in countries with}} low PCa incidence (such as China), may still have a very low probability of harboring PCa. 8 To investigate the usefulness of PSAD for detecting PCa in Chinese men, we analyzed two groups of Chinese men undergoing screening for PCa. The first group included <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA of 2. 5 – 10. 0  ng ml− 1, in the traditional PSA “gray zone, ” while the second group included <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA above this range (PSA 10. 1 – 20. 0  ng ml− 1)  - a hypothetical Chinese PSA “gray zone ” - using multicenter data.
