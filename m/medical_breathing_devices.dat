40|$|Background: Positive expiratory {{pressure}} (PEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are {{two forms of}} resistance breathing used in spontaneously breathing patients. With a threshold resistor or a flow resistor, both PEP and CPAP provide a positive (elevated) pressure level during the expiratory phase. With PEP, inspiratory pressure is negative, i. e. lower than ambient air pressure, as during a normal inspiration, but with CPAP, the inspiratory pressure is positive, i. e. higher than ambient air pressure. Methods: This thesis is based on four separate studies in which four different <b>breathing</b> <b>devices,</b> a PEP-bottle (threshold resistor device), a PEP-mask (flow resistor device), a threshold resistor CPAP and a flow resistor device were investigated. Paper I, II and III are based on studies in healthy volunteers. Paper IV is a bench study performed in a hypobaric chamber. Paper I examined differences between two PEP devices, the PEP-bottle and the PEP-mask. Paper II evaluated {{the performance of a}} flow resistor CPAP device, (Boussignac CPAP). Paper III investigated the effect of two PEP-devices, a PEP-bottle and a PEP-mask and two CPAP devices, a threshold resistor CPAP and a flow resistor CPAP, on inspiratory capacity (IC). In paper IV, the effect of changes in ambient pressure on preset CPAP levels in two different CPAP devices was compared. Results: With the PEP bottle, both expiration and inspiration began with a zero-flow period during which airway pressure changed rapidly. With the PEP-mask, the zero-flow period was very short and the change in airway pressure almost non-existent (paper I). During normal breathing with the Boussignac CPAP, changes in airway pressure were never large enough to reduce airway pressure below zero. During forced breathing, as airflow increased, both the drop in inspiratory airway pressure and the increase in expiratory airway pressure were potentiated (paper II). IC decreased significantly with three of the <b>breathing</b> <b>devices,</b> the PEP-mask and the two CPAP devices (paper III). With the threshold resistor CPAP, measured pressure levels were close to the preset CPAP level. With the flow resistor CPAP, as the altitude increased CPAP produced pressure levels increased (paper IV). Conclusion: The effect on airway pressure, airflow, IC and the effect of changes in ambient air pressure differ between different kinds of resistance <b>breathing</b> <b>devices.</b> These differences in device performance should be taken into consideration when choosing the optimal resistance <b>breathing</b> <b>device</b> for each patient...|$|R

500|$|Freediving precludes {{the use of}} {{external}} <b>breathing</b> <b>devices,</b> and relies {{on the ability of}} divers to hold their breath until resurfacing. The technique ranges from simple breath-hold diving to competitive apnea dives. Fins and a diving mask are often used in free diving to improve vision and provide more efficient propulsion. A short breathing tube called a snorkel allows the diver to breathe at the surface while the face is immersed.

5000|$|The Royal Navy used {{a similar}} device, the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, {{but it was}} clumsy to use. The Royal Navy later adopted the {{practice}} of blow and go, in which the sailor would exhale continuously during ascent to avoid air expanding in the lungs, which could cause them to rupture. Postwar, submariner Walter F. Schlech, Jr., among others, examined submerged escape without <b>breathing</b> <b>devices</b> and discovered ascent was possible from as deep as 300 ft: [...] "in one sense, the Momsen Lung concept may have killed far more submariners than it rescued".|$|R
50|$|Other {{techniques}} can involve breathing through a straw and panting, which widens {{the opening of}} the throat by activating the Posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle. Endoscopic feedback {{can also be used to}} show a patient what is happening when they are doing simple tasks such as taking a deep breath or speaking on an inspiration. This provides the client with visual information so that they can actually see what behaviours help to open the throat and what behaviors constrict the throat. Respiratory muscle strength training, a form of increased resistance training using a hand-held <b>breathing</b> <b>device</b> has also been reported to alleviate symptoms.|$|R
500|$|In some occasions, {{the oxygen}} levels are {{persistently}} too low (oxygen saturations below 90%).

If this too is ineffective in increasing oxygen levels, the addition of oxygen therapy may be necessary. As a last resort, tracheostomy may be necessary; this involves making a surgical opening in the trachea to bypass obesity-related airway obstruction in the neck. This may be combined with mechanical ventilation with an assisted <b>breathing</b> <b>device</b> through the opening.|$|R
50|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{also known as}} chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) or chronic airflow limitation (CAL), {{is a group of}} illnesses characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible.

The term COPD includes the conditions emphysema and chronic bronchitis although most patients with COPD have characteristics of both conditions to varying degrees. Asthma being a reversible obstruction of airways is often considered separately, but many COPD patients also have some degree of reversibility in their airways.|$|R
