5|$|In 1986, {{the success}} of A Real American Hero lead <b>Marvel</b> <b>to</b> produce a second title: G.I. Joe: Special Missions which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist {{for most of the}} run, with Dave Cockrum {{providing}} pencils on several issues. Spinning out of G.I. Joe #50 and set in the same continuity, the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title, and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra. Each issue usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on a small group of Joes.|$|E
5|$|Soon after this, Hasbro {{hosted a}} meeting with Hama, Jim Shooter, Tom DeFalco, Archie Goodwin, and Nelson Yomtov to discuss {{the future of the}} property. It was at this meeting that Goodwin {{suggested}} the idea of Cobra Command as a recurring enemy for G.I. Joe to fight (similar to the HYDRA terrorist organization - recurring enemies to the aforementioned S.H.I.E.L.D. organization). Prior to this, Hasbro had not considered giving G.I. Joe an enemy. Based on the results of this meeting, Hasbro contracted <b>Marvel</b> <b>to</b> produce a comic book series featuring the toys.|$|E

25|$|Marvel Super Action was {{originally}} {{designed as a}} bi-monthly publication, but the economic recession of the mid-1970s forced <b>Marvel</b> <b>to</b> scale back their plans and the magazine was published as a one-off.
