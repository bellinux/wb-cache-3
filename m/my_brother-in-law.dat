25|$|Bob Summers, <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Binoche {{returned}} to the screen in a big-budget adaptation of Jean Giono's The Horseman on the Roof directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as {{it was at the}} time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema. The film was a box-office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to color the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s. In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role since <b>My</b> <b>Brother-in-Law</b> Killed My Sister a decade before; A Couch in New York was directed by Chantal Akerman and co-starred William Hurt. This screw-ball comedy {{tells the story of a}} New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Three Colors: Blue, The Horseman on the Roof and A Couch in New York all gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors she had turned down during the prolonged shoot of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} see," [...] said Endymion; [...] "I candidly tell you, I hope the Jesuits will have as little {{influence}} in <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> kingdom as {{in my own}} country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A captive has {{no choice}} save to listen,' {{returned}} Eleanor; 'but as to speaking of terms, <b>my</b> <b>brothers-in-law,</b> the Dauphin and the Duke of Brittany, {{may have something to}} say to them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After lunch, however, <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> natural {{buoyancy}} reasserted itself by degrees. He rallied a little. [...] "Seymour," [...] {{he said to}} me, [...] "you've heard, of course, of the Bertillon system of measuring and registering criminals." ...|$|R
2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|In the Northrop News, March 27, 1981, Stephens is {{described}} as [...] "one {{of the founders of}} Northrop Corporation." [...] Stephens said, [...] "Tom Ellsworth was talking to <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> Wesley LeFevre. He said, 'It's a shame for that fellow Northrop to be working for other people. He should head his own company.'" [...] In 1939, Stephens used his lawyerly skills to scout the countryside for a site to erect Northrop Aviation's first buildings. He was {{one of the men who}} brought John K. [...] "Jack" [...] Northrop together with Gage H. Irving [...] and La Motte Cohu. Stephens was appointed to the board as secretary and was chief of the flight division. As chief test pilot, he flew the first flying wing, the Northrop N-1M, prototype of today's B-2 bomber.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Binoche was {{nominated}} for her first César for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the film. Following Rendez-Vous, she was unsure of what role to take next. She auditioned unsuccessfully for Yves Boisset's Bleu comme l'enfer and Robin Davis's Hors la loi, but was eventually cast in <b>My</b> <b>Brother-in-Law</b> Killed My Sister (1986) by Jacques Rouffio opposite the popular French stars Michel Serrault and Michel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure. Binoche has commented that Rouffio's film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based {{on the quality of}} the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members. Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli in Leos Carax's Mauvais Sang. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César nomination. Mauvais Sang is an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief. Binoche has stated that she, [...] "discovered the camera", while shooting this film.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] remarked Mr. Gladman, licking his lips, {{which were}} dry, [...] "you won't get anything, Mr. Clodd--no, not even your three-hundred pounds, clever {{as you think}} yourself. <b>My</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> money {{will go to the}} lawyers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charles {{gazed at}} him steadily. I could see by the furtive gleam in <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> eye he was {{distinctly}} frightened. [...] "Where is the fellow?" [...] he asked. [...] "Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{incumbent}} of Lady Whittlesea's chapel {{smiled and}} bowed to him. [...] "You do not recognise me, sir; I {{have had the}} honour of seeing you in your public capacity in the City, when I have called at the bank, the bearer of <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> generous----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean as to relationship. Are you <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> {{or are you}} not?" [...] This was a {{question}} which in very truth the schoolmaster {{found it hard to}} answer. He did not answer it at all, but remained silent. [...] "Are you <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> or are you not? You call her Mrs. Peacocke, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But where's <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> Sir Mulberry?' inquired Mrs Nickleby. 'I shouldn't be {{here without}} him. I hope he's coming.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What friends?" [...] {{said the}} {{astonished}} General D'Hubert, completely off the track. [...] "I am staying with <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> over there." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{rose from}} my seat and stared solemnly at <b>my</b> misguided <b>brother-in-law.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned to}} me. [...] "Dr. Perrin {{will be here}} this afternoon, David, and he will have you dressed. Between five and six if all goes well, we shall start for Les Iles. And in the meantime, gentlemen," [...] he added with a stateliness that was natural to him, [...] "I have {{business}} which takes me to-day to <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's,</b> Monsieur de Beausejour's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me, I am sure, for {{bringing}} a spectator, Bounderby," [...] he said. [...] "Major Kosuth, whom I have the honor to present--Major Kosuth, Sir William Bounderby--is {{high up in}} the diplomatic service of a country with whom we must feel every sympathy--the young Turks. The Count von Hern, who takes <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> place, is probably known to you by name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Barbara. [...] "You {{need not}} be diffident. In your case there were the dollars of which <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> plundered you." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{knocked down}} half the wall, and never found {{so much as}} a four- penny bit. <b>My</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> {{did not know what to}} think.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill? When you say Bill, do {{you mean}} Bill? Your brother Bill? <b>My</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> Bill? Jolly old William, the son and heir of the Brewsters?" ...|$|E
60|$|I did so, {{making my}} own {{likeness}} quite a pleasant {{relief to the}} ugliness of <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's.</b> It was <b>my</b> intention to send both portraits to the Royal Academy Exhibition, to get custom, and show the public generally what I could do. I knew the institution with which I had to deal, and called my own likeness, Portrait of a Nobleman.|$|R
6000|$|That night {{again we}} {{spent at the}} Lakeside Hotel. In the small hours of the morning, as I lay awake and meditated, a thought broke across me. I was so excited by it that I rose and rushed into <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> bedroom. [...] "Charles, Charles!" [...] I exclaimed, [...] "we have taken too much for granted once more. Perhaps Elihu Quackenboss carried off your dispatch-box!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I like it well enough! I {{have been}} working very hard--at least, pretty hard--so I haven't had time to feel it dull; and of course I know all the {{officers}} in <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> regiment. But I shall be very glad, indeed, of a cruise; especially as we are likely presently, by all they say, to be cut off here--some say for months, some say for years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a great pity you couldn't {{have brought}} <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> with you. It's a great shame {{he should be}} in New York in these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Twould be better, {{that the}} estate of <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> {{should be kept in}} sight, judicious François, than to be sent adrift on the high seas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may have}} noticed that he never comes when <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> is not here, and then he brings {{drawings}} or estimates of some kind with him." ...|$|E
60|$|Isaac. For Heaven's sake, now, <b>my</b> dear <b>brother-in-law,</b> don't be in a rage! I'll {{recollect}} {{as well as}} I can.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am grieved, though, I confess, not {{surprised}} by this information, Mr. Lydgate. For my own part, I regretted your alliance with <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> family, which has always been of prodigal habits, and which has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its present position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that instead of involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a doubtful struggle, you should simply become a bankrupt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Richard went on, [...] "I'm groping about a bit. I don't understand. Forgive me if I {{run off the}} track. I'm not forgetting our friendship, Maderstrom, or what I owe to {{you since}} you came and found me at Wittenburg. But for all that, you have served in the German Army and are an enemy, and I {{want to know what}} you are doing here, in England, in <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's</b> house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Acidly.] My dear, you {{sometimes}} say things which {{explain to me}} why <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> so frequently abandoned his own fireside for the platform of Exeter Hall.|$|E
60|$|It {{moved into}} the moonlight, and then <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> {{saw that it was}} the figure of a wizened little old man, in knee-breeches and a pig-tail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{though we}} only {{discovered}} it afterwards, {{you knew that}} Saxton was scheming against <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> and bought up the timber-rights to extort money from him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Isaac. No {{more she}} is, <b>my</b> dear <b>brother-in-law.</b> I'faith I {{would not be}} angry about her; she is not worth it, indeed.|$|R
6000|$|Barbara {{thrust the}} papers into the case. [...] "I am sorry I didn't think of that," [...] she said. [...] "Even if you don't {{appreciate}} my thanks {{you will have}} to put up with <b>my</b> <b>brother-in-law's,</b> and he is a man who remembers. It might have cost him a good deal if anybody who could not be trusted had seen those papers--and now no more of them. Take that canvas chair, and don't move again until I tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For shame, Albinia, I have {{so often}} {{told you about}} Ellen. I'm sure you can't forget. Her husband is <b>my</b> sister's <b>brother-in-law's</b> cousin.' ...|$|R
