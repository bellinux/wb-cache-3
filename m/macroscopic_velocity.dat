A so-called coarse time stepper can then be constructed for these macroscopic variables, only using appropriately initialized molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, we define lifting and restriction operators to initialize the microscopic system using the macroscopic information and vice versa. The restriction is defined by means of a kernel density estimation, combined with spline interpolation to obtain a smooth low-dimensional macroscopic representation. The proposed lifting procedure initializes the microscopic degrees of freedom of the molecular dynamics simulation consistently with a given <b>macroscopic</b> density and <b>velocity</b> profile, including local temperature information.

40|$|Abstract. The {{particle}} level set method (PLSM) and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{have been}} two major physics-based liquid simulation techniques used in computer graphics to generate splendid and dynamic visual effects. PLSM suffers from a high computational cost which arises from the global pressure correction step whereas LBM requires {{a large amount of}} memory to store distribution functions. In this work, we propose a hybrid lattice Boltzmann method (HLBM), which integrates PLSM and LBM, to visualize realistic liquid motion with emphasis on the behavior of the liquid-gas interface. HLBM first runs the LBM solver, com-putes <b>macroscopic</b> <b>velocities,</b> and extrapolates the velocity field to the gas region. Subsequently, the level set function and particles are advected by the extrapolated velocity field, and advected particles are used to correct errors in the level set function based on PLSM. Finally, the den-sity difference between LBM and PLSM solvers is added to the distribution functions to cor-rect the errors of LBM. We test the method for the broken dam and the water drop simula-tions. The results show that HLBM improves the quality of the fluid simulation without in-creasing the number of grids. Compared to the simulation using LBM with a grid resolution of 350, the mean of the geometrical distance from the ground truth is 21. 70 % and 13. 02 % less using HLBM with the same number of grids, for the water drop and the broken dam simulations...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} ground state {{properties}} and the excitation spectrum of bosons which, {{in addition to}} a short-range repulsive two body potential, interact through the exchange of some dispersionless bosonic modes. The latter induces a time dependent (retarded) boson-boson interaction which is attractive in the static limit. Moreover the coupling with dispersionless modes introduces a reference frame for the moving boson system and hence breaks the Galilean invariance of this system. The ground state of such a system is depleted linearly in the boson density due to the zero point fluctuations driven by the retarded part of the interaction. Both quasiparticle (microscopic) and compressional (<b>macroscopic)</b> sound <b>velocities</b> of the system are studied. The microscopic sound velocity is calculated up the second order in the effective two body interaction in a perturbative treatment, similar to that of Beliaev for the dilute weakly interacting Bose gas.
