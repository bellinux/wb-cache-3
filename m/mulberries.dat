40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the quality characteristics of <b>mulberry</b> cultivated under greenhouse and open field conditions. Quality characteristics such {{as the number of}} aerobic bacteria, pH, acidity, soluble solid content, and contents of free sugar, polyphenol, and anthocyanin were investigated. The number of aerobic bacteria in <b>mulberry</b> cultivated in open fields was higher than that of <b>mulberry</b> cultivated in the greenhouse. The average pH was significantly higher in greenhouse <b>mulberry</b> whereas acidity was higher in <b>mulberry</b> grown in open fields. The average soluble solid content of <b>mulberry</b> cultivated in open fields was slightly higher than that of <b>mulberry</b> cultivated in the greenhouse, although the difference was not significant.

25|$|Human {{settlements}} {{are marked}} by lush fields and trees, all irrigated with water from glacial streams, springs, and rivers. Higher altitude villages grow barley, peas, and vegetables, and have one species of willow (called Drokchang in Ladakhi). Lower villages also grow wheat, alfalfa, mustard for oil, grapes, and {{a greater variety of}} vegetables. Cultivated trees in lower villages include apricots, apples, <b>mulberries,</b> walnuts, balsam poplars, Afghan poplars, oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and several species of willow (difficult to identify, and local names vary). Elms and white poplars are found in the Nubra Valley, and one legendary specimen of white poplar grows in Alchi in the Indus Valley. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), Himalayan cypress and horse chestnut have been introduced since the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely {{on being able to}} {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the <b>Mulberries</b> were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: breakwater, piers, roadways etc.|$|E
25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), <b>mulberries</b> (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E

25|$|Barolos {{tend to be}} rich, deeply {{concentrated}} full bodied wines with pronounced tannins and acidity. The {{wines are}} almost always lightly colored varying from ruby to garnet in their youth to more brick and orange hues as they age. Like Pinot noir, Barolos are never opaque. Barolos {{have the potential for}} a wide range of complex and exotic aromas with tar and roses being common notes. Other aromas associated with Barolos include camphor, chocolate, dried fruit, damsons, eucalyptus, leather, licorice, mint, <b>mulberries,</b> plum, spice, strawberries, tobacco, white truffles as well as dried and fresh herbs. The tannins of the wine add texture and serve to balance Barolo's moderate to high alcohol levels (Minimum 13% but most often above 15% ABV). Excessive extraction from prolonged maceration periods and oak aging can give the wines an over-extracted bitterness.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{made from}} Nebbiolo are {{characterized}} by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for aging {{and some of the}} highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can continue to improve in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with aromas of tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, <b>mulberries,</b> spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{is also a}} very vegetated place. In the {{beginning}} Pierre-Paul Riquet planted trees to stabilize the banks of the canal especially where it overlooked the surrounding lands. The willow was widely used for its rapid growth. The engineer also planted irises {{on the side of the}} canal to reduce subsidence of its banks. In the 18th century the trees planted along the canal become a source of income. So <b>mulberries</b> were planted for rearing silkworms. Then, with the end of the silk culture in 1772, the mulberry trees were replaced by the poplar from Italy which was the most productive wood. Structures and lock-keepers' houses were decorated with fruit trees. At the Revolution plantations around the canal had approximately 60,000 trees when there were only 45,000 at {{the beginning}}. It was under the First Empire that Plane trees began to be planted to replace the cut trees, which are today the dominant variety along the canal.|$|E
