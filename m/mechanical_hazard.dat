It was carried out by obtaining time series statistical data of 7 years from hazard identification and risk assessment report of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Apapa, western port headquarters. The variables considered are the associated risks of various types of occupational and workplace hazards to which seaport workers were exposed from 2009 - 2014. The overall level of associated risks of occupational and workplace hazards represent the cumulative of various hazards and were treated as the dependent variable ‘Y’. The exposures to the risks of mechanical hazards, ergonomic hazards, physical hazards, noise/environmental hazards were symbolized as X 1, X 2, X 3, and X 4 respectively and treated as independent variables. The method of multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the time series data. T-test was used to test the hypotheses. It was found that risks associated to <b>mechanical</b> <b>hazard,</b> ergonomic hazards, noise/vibration hazard, physical hazards, all have significant impact on the overall level of risk of exposure to occupational and workplace hazards in Nigerian seaport environment.

Furthermore, manufacturing technology has succeeded to decrease the risk of machinery and work surrounding whichcause bad effect to human. However, this change becomes ineffective when the human have bad behaviour in workplace. Many research have shown that the human error have caused the majority of accident in workplace. This human error resulted from bad behaviour which has been implemented by worker. University as the place to form the behaviour of educated people in the world, has had the responsibility to promote safety and health in workplace. But, the fact describe that the university does not promote safety and health in university surrounding. This was proven by many accidents like fire, body injuries and sick related to work happened in university surrounding. As the result, many educated people who were graduated from university have bad behaviour in workplace. This research was taken in laboratory under industrial engineering department. Laboratory as the place to practice the theory which learned in the class has many potential hazard. Based on the preliminary research, many students did not realize the potential hazard.

40|$|Gastric mucus {{is thought}} to protect the {{underlying}} mucosal cells from <b>mechanical</b> <b>hazards</b> and back-diffusion of luminal H+. In health, a pH gradient exists across the mucus layer from the variable low pH of the lumen to a pH approaching neutrality at the epithelial cell surface. By current hypotheses this gradient is maintained by the combined effects of an unstirred layer, restricted or slowed diffusion of H+ in the mucus, and the epithelial cell secretion of bicarbonate, which is confined to the cell surface by the mucus layer. These mechanisms do not explain how H+ is secreted through mucus in the first place. Using a modified diffusion chamber we have shown that pig gastric mucus facilitates a low-efficiency Na+/H+ exchange - a property that helps to clarify some previously unexplained components of H+ secretion. When a solution containing Na+ was separated by a layer of fresh pig gastric mucus from a solution of similar pH containing a much lower concentration of sodium, the sodium-rich solution was electrically negative relative to the sodium-poor solution and its pH decreased significantly with time. A similar pH gradient developed when the barrier was a synthetic cation-exchange membrane, and one of opposite sign when it was an anion exchanger; no pH gradient developed across neutral barriers. It is suggested that similar electrical coupling of H+ diffusion to active Na+ transport might in vivo ensure that secreted H+ moves into the gastric lumen. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This study developed an observation-based methodology for systematically evaluating occupational health and safety hazards in agriculture, and pilot-tested this on several small-scale Hmong farming operations. Each observation assessed of range of safety and health hazards (e. g., musculoskeletal hazards, dust and pollen, noise, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>hazards),</b> as well as on factors such as type of work area, presence of personal protective equipment, and weather conditions. Thirty-six observations were collected on nine farms. The most common hazards observed were bending at the back and lifting 50 pounds were also common.

The results of this assessment agreed well with a parallel study of perceived safety and health hazards among Hmong agricultural workers. This study suggests that small-scale Hmong farming operations involve a variety of hazards, and that occupational health interventions may be warranted in this community.

The adaptation of the epidermis to a permanent life outside of the water was an essential step {{in the evolution of}} reptiles, birds, and mammals. The common ancestral origin of these terrestrial vertebrates is reflected in the shared presence of a gene cluster called the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC), which controls the formation of the cornified layers of the epidermis. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize novel factors and processes that contribute to the protective functions of the epidermis in reptiles and birds (Sauropsida). Comparative studies of genome and transcriptome sequences led to the first description of the EDC and its protein products in turtles, crocodilians and snakes. In each of these reptilian clades 50 - 100 epidermal differentiation genes were characterized at the sequence level. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments, turtle EDC genes were confirmed to be expressed in the skin or specifically in the scutes of the turtle shell. A newly generated antibody was used to demonstrate the expression of an avian EDC protein in feathers. Furthermore, specific features of the epidermal barrier, such as the defense mechanisms against microbes and the molecular cross-linking of corneous beta proteins (beta-keratins), were investigated in vitro. Reptilian skin-specific peptides were tested for their antimicrobial activities on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Disulfide bonds of corneous beta proteins were studied by exposure to reduction and alkylation or oxidation followed by western blot analysis.

Once the invading microorganisms have been brought under control, the skin proceeds to heal itself. The ability of the skin to heal even after considerable damage has occurred is due to the presence of stem cells in the dermis and cells in the stratum basale of the epidermis, all of which can generate new tissue.|$|R
