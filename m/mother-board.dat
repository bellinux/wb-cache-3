40|$|Time-of-flight (TOF) {{detectors}} {{are mainly}} used for both particle identification and triggering. Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors are becoming widely used {{because of their}} excellent TOF capabilities and reduced cost. The new ESTRELA* RPC wall, which is being installed in the HADES detector at Darmstadt GSI, will contain 1024 RPC modules, covering an active area of around 7 m 2. It has excellent TOF and good charge resolutions. Its Front-End electronics {{is based on a}} 8 -layer <b>Mother-Board</b> providing impedance matched paths for the output signals of each of the eight 4 -channel Daughter-Boards to the TDC...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{application}} from DNA information organization for providing {{the next generation}} super-computers has been proposed by lessons learned from nature. Thus, molecular environment of reserving information was considered as succeeding generation of a <b>mother-board</b> project containing some subcategories with various applications. MERI, constructed based on the binary coding system using DNA synthesizer machine, enables retrievable reading of molecular structures using DNA sequencer machine. It has high capacity for reservation of information about 1. 212 × 1011 Kb/cm 2 with long-term stability.

40|$|Abstract: Experimental {{measurements}} and numerical modeling {{were used to}} study the EM 1 performance of a module-on-backplane connector for various configurations of signal-return pin-outs. A commercially available open-pin-field connector was used in these results to connect between the <b>mother-board</b> and the daughter-card. The experimental techniques, based on measuring I&J, included both common-mode current {{measurements and}} monopole near-field probe measurements. The FDTD method was used to provide numerical support of the near-field measurements and generally agreed with the measured results for frequencies up to 3 GHz. The FDTD method was also used to investigate {{the relationship between the}} radiated EM 1 at 3 m and the connector pin-out configurations. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a high-speed, low-cost, generic {{analogue}} preconditioning system, which is capable of interfacing {{with a wide variety}} of transducers, is described. A multi-purpose, configurable data acquisition module, which is also capable of data generation, is presented. Software support is provided by advanced signal analysis and innovative presentation algorithms that are implemented on a powerful embedded digital signal processor. Precision voltage-feedback and high-speed current-feedback operational amplifiers are combined to form adaptable, front-end multi-stage composite amplifiers. These distinctive composite amplifiers retain the individual qualities of their incorporated parts. The amplifier’s output voltage range is designed to match a standard ADC input voltage range. Easy to implement data converter circuitry and front-end signal amplification components were implemented on a detachable printed circuit daughterboard. A resourceful method of interfacing allows a series of Texas Instruments DSP <b>mother-boards</b> to be accessible. The PCB features single and dual input channel operation, adjustable input voltage ranges and sampling rates under software control. Bi-directional capability adds diagnostic functionality to the already versatile highperformance data acquisition system. The high-speed preconditioning and data converter element’s vulnerability to inconsistent and non-ideal real world effects such as noise, signal interference, parasitics, proximity effects and other layout problems is discussed. Real-time digital filtering, spectrum and phase analysis sub-routines form codeintensive multi-functional programmes that simultaneously display visually and record numerically the input signal properties in a comprehensive fashion. A user directed, automated, calibration software programme was developed to correct for precision-based errors caused by the signal conditioning instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|Year 2007 was {{crowned with}} {{the test of}} a {{complete}} RPC sector equipped with 400 FEE channels [1]; a very important mile-stone, indeed, in order for HADES to explore extreme heavy ion collisions in the years 2009 - 2010. Despite the success, specially regarding the overall detector performance, there were nevertheless concerns regarding the minimum threshold, grounding, system stability, discharge protection and FEE production yield, so efforts were driven to introduce modifications in the FEE design in order to overcome these potentially troublesome limitations. The FEE of the HADES RPC wall consists of two boards: the DB (Daughter-Board) performing the amplification and digitization of 4 channels, and the MB (<b>Mother-Board)</b> providing the DBs with the regulated power, test signals, a fast sum signal for trigger, threshold setting an...|$|E
40|$|Multichip modules (MCMs) {{containing}} {{power components}} need a substrate with excellent heat spreading capability both to avoid hot spots {{and to move}} dissipated heat toward the system heat sinks. Polycrystalline diamond is an excellent MCM heat spreading substrate but remains several orders of magnitude too expensive and somewhat more difficult to process than conventional <b>mother-board</b> materials. Today`s power MCMs concentrate on moderately priced silicon wafers and aluminum nitride ceramic with their improved thermal conductivity and good thermal expansion match to power semiconductor components, in comparison to traditional alumina and printed wiring board materials. However, even silicon and AlN substrates are challenged by designers` thermal needs. We report on the fabrication of micro-heat pipes embedded in silicon MCM substrates (5 {times} 5 cm) {{by the use of}} micromachined capillary wick structures and hermetic micro-cavities. This passive microstructure results in more than a 5 times improvement in heat spreading capability of the silicon MCM substrate over a large range of power densities and operating temperatures as compared with silicon alone. Thus diamond-like cooling is possible at silicon prices...|$|E
40|$|The {{lead-free}} Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC 305 / 405) solder that {{replaced the}} tin-lead eutectic solder {{tends to be}} more brittle in nature due to high stiffness and excessive solder interfacial reactions. This leads to higher occurrences of solder joints failure during surface mount assembly and handling operations as a result of PCB bending, shock impact and drop. In this work, mechanical tests simulating the shock impact were conducted on lead-free SAC of different weight percentages. These SAC materials were prepared for use in the solder joints of fine pitch ball grid array (BGA) components which were mounted onto the <b>mother-board.</b> After the mechanical shock tests, strain measurements were performed on the BGA components to gauge the solder joint integrity, which was shown to be related with the formation of intermetallics in the bulk and at the interface of the SAC solder. The ball pull tests were conducted to determine both the bulk and interfacial strength and the solder joint fracture, which was classified as either mode 1, 2 or 3. A correlation was made between the silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) weight percentages with the metallurgical reactions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
