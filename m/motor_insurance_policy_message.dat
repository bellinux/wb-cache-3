This paper illustrates AXA and their securitization of French <b>motor</b> <b>insurance</b> in 2005 as an example.

As a consequence we develop motor loss rate bonds using the structure of synthetic CDOs. The coupon payments of each tranche depend on the level of the loss rates of the underlying <b>motor</b> <b>insurance</b> pool. We show the integral formulas for the loss tranche contract where the loss distribution is modelled with discounted compound Poisson process.

40|$|Insurance is a fi nancial {{service in}} which {{consumption}} is highly {{affected by the}} characteristics of the potential buyer and his perceptions about the offered product. <b>Motor</b> <b>insurance</b> with its two components – the Motor Third Party Liability Insurance (MTPL) and the <b>Motor</b> Damage <b>insurance</b> – constitutes the largest line of business of the non-life insurance sector in Europe. The present study models the voluntary <b>motor</b> damage <b>insurance</b> consumer behaviour using discrete choice models, hypothesizing a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical decision. The sample consists of 311 car owners from Cluj County, Romania. The econometric estimations use binary logit, multinomial logit and nested logit models. The predictive power of these models is compared by means of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for discrete choice models. The results reveal that the main factors affecting the purchase of a voluntary <b>motor</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> are risk preference/aversion, the distance travelled by car, the driver’s education level and the ratio between the driver’s income and the car price. In contrast to previous studies who estimated the risk profi le only through proxy variables without accounting for any behavioural aspects, our study has successfully integrated the risk profi le of the policyholders as a self-standing explanatory variable. Since the explanatory variables are representative not only for a particular geographical area, the highlighted behaviour may be applied to all cases where <b>motor</b> damage <b>insurance</b> is voluntary...|$|R

The coverage is mainly obtained to prevent theft, which has the major significance. Insurance companies have been trying since a long time to curtail the cost of theft, which is the major cause for higher premium rates. To achieve the objectives of this study Non Probability Technique known as Purposive Sampling is applied, based upon questionnaire survey from a representative sample of tracker and insurance service users. This research revealed that blending the <b>motor</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies,</b> with tracker devices, have successfully attracted the major chunk of market and have gained access to a larger segment of the market, offering packaged policies with discounted premium rates and hence the loss ratio has declined with the use of these devices, which ultimately affects the premium rates.

The Italian insurance market appears weak with regard to non life and non motor insurance: Italy ranks only 18 th in Europe in terms of the ratio between non life and non motor premiums and GDP.

Regardless of their wealth, families subscribing to a non life and non <b>motor</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> show a significantly lower propensity for financial liquidity. This relationship suggests an opportunity: selling insurance products to high liquidity families offers financial industry the possibility to sell them new financial assets too.
