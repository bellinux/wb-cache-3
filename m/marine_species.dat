40|$|<b>Marine</b> {{invasive}} <b>species</b> incursions {{can cause}} significant ongoing damage to marine environments, aquaculture, biodiversity, infrastructure, and social amenity. They represent {{a significant and}} ongoing economic burden. Marine pests can be introduced by several vectors, including aquaculture, aquarium trading, commercial shipping, fishing, floating debris, mining activities, and recreational boating. Despite the inherent risks, there is currently relatively little routine surveillance of <b>marine</b> pest <b>species</b> conducted {{in the majority of}} countries worldwide. Accurate and rapid identification of <b>marine</b> pest <b>species</b> is central to early detection and management. Traditional techniques (e. g., physical sampling and sorting) have limitations, which has motivated recent progress towards the development of molecular surveillance tools. This chapter highlights the importance of effective sampling and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction strategies and describes developments in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based and ecogenomic methods for the detection and surveillance of <b>marine</b> invasive <b>species.</b> Recent advances provide a platform for the development of practical, specific, sensitive, and rapid diagnosis and surveillance tools for <b>marine</b> invasive <b>species</b> for use in effective prevention and control strategies...|$|R

5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment.

5|$|On the {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} island, many <b>marine</b> <b>species</b> are found. Starfish are abundant, as are sea urchins and limpets.

5|$|The more <b>marine</b> <b>species,</b> such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants.

5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a <b>marine</b> <b>species,</b> both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the <b>marine</b> <b>species</b> had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the <b>marine</b> <b>species</b> producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to <b>marine</b> <b>species,</b> led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E

5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and <b>marine</b> <b>species</b> are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E
5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some <b>marine</b> <b>species,</b> like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of <b>Marine</b> <b>Species</b> (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification.|$|E
