25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{important}} {{structural changes}} {{eventually led to}} the breakdown of international <b>monetary</b> <b>management.</b> One change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence. The stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to convertibility of the Western European currencies at the end of 1958 and of the Japanese yen in 1964. Convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions, which deepened monetary interdependence.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} indexes {{of central}} bank autonomy (CBA) for 163 central banks as of end- 2003, and comparable indexes for a subgroup of 68 central banks {{as of the}} end of the 1980 s. The results confirm strong improvements in both economic and political CBA over the past couple of decades, although more progress is needed to boost political autonomy of the central banks in emerging market and developing countries. Our analysis confirms that greater CBA has on average helped to maintain low inflation levels. The paper identifies four broad principles of central bank autonomy that have been shared by the majority of countries. Significant differences exist in the area of banking supervision where many central banks have retained a key role. Finally, we discuss the sequencing of reforms to separate the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies.
