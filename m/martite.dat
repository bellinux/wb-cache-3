In addition to the large ore bodies there is a substantial area of thin fragmental ore deposits in the form of four surficial deposits. The main hematitic ore is medium- to fine-grained and displays a variety of massive, banded and porous textures. It occurs in lenses and sheets, within the Awband Formation. The thickness of the lenses has been indicated by drilling to be up to 100m, while the depth of mineralisation is untested 180m below surface. There are two main ore groups: unoxidised primary ores and semi-oxidised ores. The primary ores occur below 100 m and consist of magnetite and pyrite, and up to 5% chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The oxidised ores, extending up to 130m below ground surface, consist mainly of magnetite, <b>martite</b> and hydrogoethite.

A chemometric analysis based on the concentrations of the different minerals as determined with a combination of conventional methods (chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, light-reflected microscopy, and magnetic susceptibility) and the principal components derived from the diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible range was performed.

The ore petrographic studies of the lodestone reveal the presence of primary Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, ulvospinel, pleonaste, hematite and pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and secondary Ti-maghemite, <b>martite</b> and goethite as well as secondary covellite. These layers contain Ti-magnetite (60 %) and ilmenite (30 %) with silicates (< 5 %) exhibiting granular mosaic texture with well-defined triple junctions and are classified as adcumulus rocks. The grain-boundary relationships in the ores indicate considerable postcumulus growth and readjustment due to combined effects of sintering and adcumulus growth. Intergrowth textures (ulvospinel, ilmenite and pleonaste in Ti-magnetite and hematite in ilmenite) reflects exsolution features crystallized from solid-solutions compositions under different conditions of oxygen fugacities.

The textures of typical BIF categories are also presented as the only sedimentary feature. Two types of BIF facies are present at Njweng: the oxide and silicate facies. These facies show two stages of phase transformations. The first is the transformation of the original magnetite mineral into <b>martite</b> by oxidation resulting in trellis texture; the second is a simultaneous trans formation by hydration into goethite and dehydration into <b>martite.</b> The samples typically show LREE depleted patterns relative to HREE, a characteristic similar to that of modern seawater. Also the strong positive Eu anomalies from the samples indicate the involvement of hydrothermal plumes of volcanic origin such as at mid ocean ridges (MOR). Yt trium (Y) has a strong positive anomaly pointing to the transportation of REEs as aqueous complexes within these ancient seas. The BIF samples have no positive Ce anomalies, suggesting that the oceans at that time were more reducing with no Ce fractionation than in present day oceans. The martite-goethite mineralization rather shows a positive Ce anomaly that derived from the enrichment in REE during the weathering of REE-bearing minerals.

40|$|Rock {{magnetic}} properties and petrological {{investigations of the}} magnetite-bearing Variscan Soultz granite from the EPS- 1 borehole (Upper Rhine Graben) provided a significant contribution for {{the understanding of the}} “old” (Middle Carboniferous to Permo-Triassic) hydrothermal alteration history. This alteration history is generally subdivided into two stages. Stage I alteration is related to processes during magma cooling and solidification of the plutonic body in Middle Carboniferous times. Stage II alteration is associated with post-emplacement tectonics from Late Carboniferous to Permo-Triassic, such as exhumation of the plutonic body to a paleo-erosion surface, near surface processes beneath the paleo-surface and the influence of the overlying Permo-Mesozoic sedimentary cover. This study focuses on two main scopes: (i) chronological succession of the alteration history of the Soultz granite, and (ii) modification of the {{magnetic properties}} in relation to the different geological processes mentioned above. During the stage I alteration the plutonic body solidified, which {{led to the formation of}} first permeable fault zones at temperatures ~ 300 °C, obtained from chlorite-geothermometry. The formation of permeable zones allowed the circulation of O 2 -rich fluids, which caused the oxidation of magnetite into <b>martite</b> (hematite) within discrete zones. Granites, which are situated further away from a fault zone remained unaffected, and thus are called “fresh” from the magnetic point of view (magnetic susceptibility, k > 10 x 10 - 3 SI). The k(T) measurements revealed thermomagnetic behavior typical for multi-domain magnetite in fresh granite and an irreversible thermomagnetic behavior in altered granite reflecting the oxidation degree of magnetite. Such degree is related to an alteration index (Al-index) obtained from the difference between k of the heating and the cooling run at room temperature. The AMS (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibilty) fabric in fresh granites is related to the subhorizontal primary magmatic fabric indicating emplacement within a decelerating flow regime. Along with the oxidation of magnetite k was decreased to values < 1 x 10 - 3 SI. The primary horizontal magnetic fabric changed to a steeply dipping and NW-SE trending magnetic fabric in the altered granite due to a microcrack-controlled oxidation. This oxidation caused elongated and aligned small magnetite relics within the host mineral <b>martite.</b> Paleomagnetic investigations revealed that this first faulting event took place during Middle Carboniferous. During Late Carboniferous, probably until Perm, the plutonic body was affected by unloading and exhumation. The initial fault zones were reactivated and k(T) curves revealed the formation of pyrite and Fe-carbonates. The AMS fabric in wall rocks of the fault zones evolved from a normal to an inverse fabric due to decreased (single-domain) grain sizes of the magnetite relics. At the same time, the AMS fabric in the cataclastic granites was destroyed by brittle deformation. The exhumation of the plutonic body to a paleo-erosion surface resulted in near surface processes within the upper borehole section. These processes caused an oxidation of pyrite, which led to the circulation of strongly acidic fluids. Such acidic fluids led to the decomposition of Fe-carbonates and <b>martite</b> until they were neutralized by mixing with meteoric fluids, which in turn caused the precipitation of abundant fine-grained hematite. This event led to a widespread hematitization of the upper borehole section. The fine-grained hematite shows paleofield vectors typical for Permo-Triassic. In contrast, fault zones at the bottom of the borehole remained unaffected by this near surface processes. Granites from these fault zones display a reduction of <b>martite</b> back to magnetite caused by the infiltration of organic matter from the overlying Permo-Mesozoic sedimentary cover. In such granites, no relevant paleomagnetic information could be obtain...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe banded iron {{formation}} of the Bababudan Group (Western Dharwar Craton, India) is composed of millimetric to centimetric alternating quartz and grey to red Fe-oxide bands. Major phases are quartz and <b>martite</b> (hematized magnetite) with minor Fe-sulfides and Ca-Mg-Fe-carbonates. Micrometric Fe-oxide spherules fill cavities in discontinuous micrometric layers of Fe-oxides {{that occur in the}} massive quartz layers and at the interface of massive Fe-oxide and quartz layers. The spherules are composed of micrometric radial plates of hematite intergrown with nanometric magnetite. These spherules contain carbonaceous matter (CM) with nanometric Fe-particles and have low N contents (∼ 900 ppm; CM 1). The spherule formation is attributed to a low temperature hydrothermal process (150 - 200 °C) at around 2. 52 Ga, possibly favored by the presence of CM. These hydrothermal fluids dissolved diagenetic interstitial sulfides or carbonates creating cavities which, provided space for the spherule precipitation. Carbonaceous matter of semi-anthracite maturity is encapsulated in quartz grains adjacent to the Fe-oxide spherules (CM 2) and it is thus concluded that CM 1 and CM 2 are most likely contemporaneous and of the same origin, either incorporated at the time of BIF formation or during the hydrothermal event at 2. 52 Ga from the underlying phyllitised black shales. Carbonaceous matter (CM 3) was also found around the Fe-oxide spherules and the <b>martite</b> grains. CM 3 has much higher N contents (> 5000 ppm), is of a lower maturity than CM 1 and CM 2, and is related to weathering, which is also indicated by the presence of goethite and kaolinite.

40|$|Variable mineral {{chemistry}} and textures of basal Negaunee iron ores mined in the Main Tilden Pit {{have led to}} metallurgical difficulties. Core-logging and detailed petrography supported by microprobe investigations, identify three upward fining lithofacies within the Main Pit Carbonate and overlying <b>Martite</b> ore domains: 1) Basal Clastics; 2) Medial BIF; and 3) Granular Iron Formation. Growth fault related subsidence controlled deposition of the Basal Clastics, comprised of detrital quartz dispersed in a matrix of chlorite, cemented by ferri-hydrite, chert and Mg-siderite. Subsequent starvation of any clastic input led to cyclic iron-silica precipitation throughout the deposition of Medial BIF. Increasing wave action accompanied marine transgression caused deposition of granular rip-up clasts to form the Upper Granular Iron Formation. These domains are cross-cut by numerous chloritized feeder dykes and are capped by a greenstone Pillar, indicating overlapping mafic magmatism. Low grade regional metamorphism attending the 1850 Ma Penokean arc-continent collision led to magnetite growth, carbonate grain coarsening and chlorite crystallization. Metamorphic fluids facilitated <b>martite</b> replacement of magnetite and deformation led to developing local platy specularite schists.

This complex paragenetic history accounts for the unpredictable geometallurgical response of the basal Negaunee iron ores. Treatment difficulties relate to: 1) variable silica-iron separation occurs due to liberation from detrital quartz versus massive mosaic and granular textured chert; 2) the bulk iron content is expressed not only in iron oxide but in iron carbonate and iron chlorite; and 3) the intense late IOCG overprint proximal to the Signal Hill Fault...|$|E
40|$|Three giant {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} - Mt. Whaleback, Mt. Tom Price and Paraburdoo occur in deformed {{parts of the}} southern Hamersley Province, where banded iron-formation (BIF) of the Dales Gorge Member has been has been converted to <b>martite</b> and microplaty hematite. The genesis of these high-grade hematite ores has remained controversial, in part because no study has systematically documented variations on the chemistry and mineralogy of stratigraphically equivalent rocks from undeformed and unmineralized strata in the north, through deformed but unmineralized strata in the south, and into the ore deposits. This study examines the powder colour, chemistry, mineralogy and petrography of 270 samples of the Dales Gorge Member and surrounding shales from several locations across the southeastern Hamersley Province, including Mt. Whaleback. On {{the basis of these}} analyses, samples of BIF and shale can each be categorized into four groups. Unaltered BIF consists of sub-equal portions of SiO₂ and Fe₂O₃ and moderate amounts of MgO, CaO and loss on ignition (LOI). Compared to these rocks, weathered BIF has significantly higher SiO₂, but lower MgO, CaO and LOI. Likewise, oxidized BIF from Mt. Whaleback has lower MgO, CaO and LOI, but interestingly it has higher Fe₂O₃ than unaltered BIF. In striking contrast to all BIF, iron are is relatively enriched in Fe₂O₃ and depleted in all other major elements particularly SiO₂. As for chemistry, the mineralogy of BIF varies significantly across the Hamersley Province. Unaltered BIF is largely composed of fine-grained chert and euhedral magnetite, although fine-grained siderite, stilpnomelane, ankerite, dolomite, minnesotaite, and riebeckite are significant in some samples. Weathered BIF contains hematite instead of magnetite (<b>martite)</b> and goethite pseudomorphs of carbonates and silicates. Chert remains unaltered. Oxidized BIF from Mt. Whaleback similarly consists of <b>martite</b> and chert, however it does not contain any goethite. Instead these rocks contain abundant microplaty hematite nucleated on <b>martite</b> euhedra or within small voids left by the dissolution of gangue. In comparison to all BIF, iron ore lacks chert and is composed entirely of <b>martite</b> in a porous network of microplaty hematite. Profound differences in chemistry also occur between shales. Unaltered black shale predominantly consists of SiO₂ and Fe₂O₃ with relatively high contents of Al₂O₃, MgO, CaO, K₂O and LOI. Compared to these rocks altered black shale at Mt. Whaleback has slightly lower SiO₂ and Fe₂O 3 and significantly higher Al 2 O₃. Red shale from Mt. Whaleback contains less SiO₂, MgO, and CaO and higher Fe₂O₃ and Al 2 O₃ than all black shales. In striking contrast to these rocks two Mt. McRae Shale samples from core located deep within the Mt. Whaleback pit are significantly enriched in MgO and CaO and depleted in SiO₂. Unaltered black shales have highly variable mineralogies, consisting of very finegrained stilpnomelane, K-feldspar and quartz with subordinate amounts of siderite, dolomite, ankerite, muscovite, biotite, pyrite and chlorite. Altered black shales contain abundant chlorite and muscovite instead of stilpnomelane, K-feldspar and carbonates. Red shales are entirely composed of very fine hematite plates and kaolinite. The two shale samples from deep within the Mt. Whaleback pit consist predominantly of fine- to medium-grained dolomite cut by numerous chlorite and ferroan-dolomite/ankerite veins. Spatially associated with many of these veins are large porphyroblasts of finegrained ferroan-dolomite and ankerite. Profound chemical and mineralogical changes between unaltered rocks and their altered equivalents suggest that after early diagenesis, low-grade metamorphism converted clays in black shales to stilpnomelane and talc. Coincident with, or following these changes, reduced metamorphic fluids altered phyllosilicates and K-feldspar in these rocks to chlorite and muscovite around Mt. Whaleback. These metamorphic fluids did not significantly affect BIF. However, subsequent acidic and oxidizing fluids around Mt. Whaleback converted magnetite to <b>martite</b> and dissolved carbonates and silicates from BIF. In black shales, these fluids also dissolved quartz and converted chlorite and muscovite to hematite and kaolinite respectively. Late in the paragenetic sequence, oxidized BIF was converted to highly porous high-grade hematite are by the dissolution of silica. Mass and volume change calculations coupled with detailed thickness measurements indicates ore genesis was a process not requiring iron addition. However, the significant increase in mieroplaty hematite growth between oxidized BIF and iron ore suggests mm- to em-scale (or m-scale?) mobilization and precipitation of iron. The paragenetie sequence for mineralization is probably more complicated as carbonate-rich, silica-poor shales deep within Mt. Whaleback and previously described magnetite-siderite rich assemblages at Mt. Tom Price suggest a stage involving carbonate replacement of silica prior to oxidation. During or after ore genesis weathered BIF developed from the interaction of unaltered BIF with acidic, oxidizing fluids associated with typical supergene weathering. An internally consistent and testable model that explains rocks at both deposits, as well as the limited geochemical and mineralogical data at Paraburdoo, can be proposed. Rocks at all three deposits experienced regional metamorphism, although the grade was less at Mt. Tom Price and Paraburdoo. Hydrothermal fluids followed by heated meteoric fluids then locally affected rocks at all three deposits, forming carbonate-rich "BIF and shale" and, ultimately, high-grade hematite ore. Substantial northward flow of acidic, oxygenated fluids sometime during or after mineralization converted BIF, including carbonate-rich "BIF" to altered martite-rich BIF. The distinct lack of abundant carbonate-rich silica-poor rocks at Mt. Whaleback compared to Mt. Tom Price and similarities between oxidized BIF from Mt. Whaleback to equivalent sequences outside the deposit suggest this oxidation was more pervasive in the southeast. It is possible, and likely that formation of these particular giant, martite-microplaty hematite rich deposits was dependent on both a phase of silica loss and a phase of oxidation during or soon after extensional deformation at ca. 2200 Ma. Initial access of deepseated silica undersaturated fluids to parts of extensional faults triggering silica loss, may have created initial chemical porosity that subsequently allowed focusing of oxidized, surface-derived fluids...|$|E

The genesis of these high-grade hematite ores remains controversial, in part because no study has systematically documented variations on the chemistry and mineralogy of stratigraphically equivalent rocks from undeformed regions into the deposits. In this study, we examine the powder colour, chemistry and mineralogy of 177 samples of the Dales Gorge Member and surrounding shales from the type section near Wittenoom and the Mt. Whaleback mine near Newman. Profound chemical and mineralogical changes suggest that after early diagenesis, low-grade metamorphism converted clays in black shales to stilpnomelane and talc.

Whaleback converted magnetite to <b>martite</b> and dissolved carbonates and silicates from BIF. In black shales, these fluids also dissolved quartz and converted clinochlore and muscovite to hematite and kaolinite, respectively. Late in the paragenetic sequence, BIF or altered BIF was converted to highly porous high-grade hematite ore by the dissolution of Si, a process not requiring iron addition. Our observations in and around Mt. Whaleback suggest that BIF was oxidized prior to silica removal so we infer {{that the bulk of}} this oxidation was related to ore formation. However, regionally, this sequence is probably more complicated because rocks previously described at Mt.

40|$|Abstract. The {{content of}} {{carbonate}} minerals in Dong Anshan iron ore was increasing in recent years, which deteriorated reverse flotation indices or even resulted in unclear separation between concentrate and tailing. In dodecylamine and sodium oleate systems, reverse flotation tests were undertaken with artificial mixed minerals of <b>martite,</b> quartz and siderite. Based on mineral flotation tests, the effect mechanism of siderite on reverse flotation were investigated {{in terms of}} SEM and EDS. Results showed that siderite was weakly depressed by starch, and the adsorption of siderite on hematite and quartz was the main cause for reverse flotation difficulties. In reverse flotation in dodecylamine system, the adverse effect of siderite on reverse flotation could be reduced when the amount of starch increased, and iron minerals and quartz were separated effectively. Therefore, the reverse flotation in dodecylamine system could be considered to realize separating effectively iron minerals and quartz of Donganshan iron ore containing carbonates, but which had high requirements on pH. Other methods were siderite being separated prior to reverse flotation or inventing flotation agents capable of effectively activating or depressing siderite...|$|E
40|$|Microscope {{studies of}} a wide range of ores and fresh, oxidized, or partly iron-enriched, banded iron-formation (BIF) have shown a {{consistent}} sequence of alteration of the primary constituents, chert, magnetite with or without hematite, carbonates, and silicates, leading to the formation of martite-(hematite) -goethite ores which form the bulk of the reserves of the Hamersley Iron Province. Primary hematite survives with little change: magnetite oxidizes to hematite (<b>martite)</b> or in part to lacunar phases between magnetite and maghemite (kenomagnetite), which in turn commonly is altered by hydration to goethite. Subsequent leaching of this goethite in preference to martitc leads to a variety of skeletal textures which lnay help identify the original magnetite, despite destruction of martire lamellae by recrystallization. Chert, carbonates, and silicates are either replaced by goethite or leached froin the system, resulting in thinning of the orebodies with respect to their parent banded iron-formations. Preser-vation of macroscopic features, such as mesobanding, and microscopic features, such as pseudomorphs, is compelling evidence of superõene enrichment which, together wit...|$|E
40|$|Högbomite, a rare exotic mineral, {{is found}} to be {{associated}} with the vanadiferous–titaniferous (V-Ti) bearing magnetite bands at Bhakatarhalli, Nuggihalli greenstone belt, western Dharwar Craton, India. We report on a second occurrence of högbomite from the Dharwar craton in Karnataka, which is the sixth documented occurrence of this mineral from India. We evaluate the chemical characteristics of högbomite and associated Fe-Ti-minerals in an attempt to identify its formation as a primary hydrothermal mineral in a metamorphosed magnetite layer. We report here the presence of högbomite as a complex oxide of Fe, Mg, Al and Ti with accessory of Zn, V and Sn. Petrographic studies suggest the (V–Ti) bearing magnetite (Mt) contain spinel, högbomite, chlorite, <b>martite,</b> ilmenite (Il) and minor amounts of diaspore. The högbomite displays euhedral to subhedral textures, and is up to 250 μm along the grain boundaries of magnetite and ilmenite. In the samples studied, högbomite is prismatic, irregular and elongated in shape. The genesis of högbomite in veins between magnetite and ilmenite implies its precipitation from fluids without involving complicated reactions. Several models were proposed for the formation of högbomite; however, the subject is still debatable. DST and SHORE (CSIR). [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The Iron Range {{iron oxide}} {{occurrence}} in south eastern British Columbia consists of massive lenses and veins of hematite and <b>martite</b> with lesser magnetite that pinch and swell along the Iron Range fault zone. It is hosted within the Proterozoic Aldridge Formation and Moyie Sills and forms a central massive iron-oxide corridor flanked by albite-quartz iron-oxide breccia. The most common alteration assemblage is albite-chlorite-hematite-magnetite +/- silica, which is locally overprinted by later iron-oxide, silica, sericite or carbonate alteration. Oxygen isotope analyses {{in conjunction with}} fluid inclusions indicate precipitation temperatures for the mineralized zones in the range 340 to 400 °C and 1750 to 4500 bars. The Iron Range iron oxide mineralized rock shares many characteristics of major IOCG deposits and alkali porphyry systems, however the exposed rocks lack economic Cu (+-Au) -concentration. Magnetite trace element chemistry is consistent with IOCG and porphyry mineralization worldwide and recent drilling intersected minor sulphide (chalcopyrite and pyrite) and gold mineralization at 200 m and 20 m depths, respectively.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{diamonds}} from Serra do Espinhaço in Diamantina region (State of Minas Gerais) and in Chapada Diamantina, Lençóis region (State of Bahia) remains uncertain, even {{taking into account}} the ample research carried out during the last decades. The lack of typical satellite minerals in both districts makes a kimberlitic source for these diamonds uncertain. In mid 18 th century the occurrence of a metamorphosed igneous rock composed of <b>martite,</b> sericite and tourmaline was described in Diamantina region and named hematitic phyllite, considered by some researchers as a possible diamond source. Similar rocks were found in Lençóis and examined petrographically and their heavy mineral concentration was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Petrographic analyses indicated an igneous origin for these rocks and SEM analyses showed the discovery of microdiamonds. Geochronological studies using the Ar/Ar technique in muscovites yielded minimum ages of 1515 ± 3 Ma, which may correlate with 1710 ± 12 Ma from U-Pb method in igneous zircons from the hematitic phyllites. Both rock types also have the same mineral and chemical composition which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} intrusive rocks were protolith of the hematitic phyllites.

40|$|Iron ore occurrences are {{situated}} on the south-eastern slopes of the Medvednica Mountain. They occur as discontinous, decameters long and 2 - 3. 5 m thick bedded, poorly mineralized (15 - 35 % Fe) lenses. A narrow, 6 km long, ore zone strikes NE-SW from Tisova Peć to Pustodol-Adolfovac. It is spatially and genetically bounded to the basic volcanogenic-sedimentary series (SEDEX-type), metamorphosed in greenschists during Cretaceous under P 3 - 3. 5 kbar and T 350 - 400 °C. The main minerals of the paragenesis are: quartz, chlorite, hematite, magnetite, stilpnomelane, <b>martite.</b> Similar types of Neo-Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic iron deposits were found in eastern Bosnia - western Serbia, western Macedonia and in the Serbo-Macedonian Mass. In the Triassic period of the Dinarides, magnetite-hematite deposits occur only as iron skarns or as short veins and small sized bodies of pneumatolytic-hydrothermal origin genetically bounded to gabbro-diorite or syenite stock and dykes. In the Triassic vulcanogenic-sedimentary complexes pointing occur only bedded deposits of red hematite, siderite, as well as locally with Mn-oxide ores. The arguments for the Paleozoic age of the Mt. Medvednica iron deposits are more convincing than those proposing theoretically possible Triassic age. The structures, textures and parageneses of the Mt. Medvednica magnetite-hematite occurrences are very similar only to the iron ores situated in the Early Paleozoic metamorphic complexes...|$|E
40|$|Muro Banded Iron-Formation {{occurs in}} the Proterozoic Toto Schist Belt, central Nigeria. It {{consists}} preponderantly of oxide facies and minor carbonate facies. The oxide facies {{is made up of}} alternating bands of quartz (metachert) with those of hematite + magnetite + <b>martite</b> ± goethite, chlorite, pyrrhotite and garnet. The carbonate facies consists of quartz (metachert) + siderite ± goethite. In the oxide facies the total iron content (Fe 2 O 3 t) ranges from 33. 95 % to 48. 08 % and the SiO 2 content from 50. 33 % to 64. 50 %. In the case of the carbonate facies, the Fe 2 O 3 t content varies from 15. 42 % to 20. 66 % and SiO 2 content from 66. 84 to 72. 86 %. The Al 2 O 3 content is generally low ranging from 0. 1 % to 0. 54 % in the oxide facies, and 0. 24 % to 0. 31 % in the carbonate facies. Chemically, the Muro Iron-Formation is similar to the Lake Superior-type iron-formations in terms of the distribution of the major and trace elements. This taken together with similarities in lithological associations indicates its deposition in similar environments i. e. shallow intra-continental or restricted/barred marine basin.

40|$|Supracrustals of the 2. 76 - 2. 71 Ga Mary River Group {{form the}} northeastern {{segment of the}} Committee Bay Belt. Field mapping has {{determined}} that this succession is preserved in structural keels marginal to high-grade gneiss domes and is characterized by lower metasedimentary rocks and an upper BIF-komatiite-quartzite succession. Algoma-type BIF sited at the dome/keel boundary is host to bodies of high-grade iron ore, the largest being Deposit 1 which has an estimated reserve of 500 mt averaging 64 wt % Fe. Field mapping, petrography, and EMPA indicates 3 main stages of ore formation. Stage 1 was characterized by {{the formation of the}} dome-and-keel tectonic style during the regional Paleoproterozoic Transhudson overprint. Juxtaposition of cold greenschist facies supracrustals against hot amphibolite facies gneiss domes resulted in dehydration of supracrustals. Dehydration of komatiites and amphibolitic wacke provided a fluid reservoir for an alkaline Mg-Fe-Ca-rich brine, and accounts for massive desilication and massive chlorite retrogression at the boundary. Stage 2 involved ascent of this hot (400 - 500 °C) fluid leaching silica, stabilizing Mg-Fe-Ca carbonate within enriched BIF. This was followed by prograde thermal metamorphism resulting in porphyroblastic growth of numerous Fe-Mg(-Ca) species. Stage 3 postdates the thermal peak and involved a shift to lower pH and cooling to below 300 °C, causing the oxidation of magnetite to <b>martite.</b> This fluid leached remnant carbonate, and release of CO 2 formed retrograde replacement of relict carbonate by talc, serpentine, sericite, and minor chlorite within the massive magnetite bodie...|$|E
40|$|Basaltic lavas {{from the}} {{southern}} Alborz, an area about 40 km northeast of Tehran, Iran, have been paleomagnetically investigated. The lavas are of Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous age, and belong to the basal member of the Geirnd Formation. At 11 sites a total of 80 cores was drilled. Detailed analyses by means of progressive demagnetization of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) were made both by the application of alternating magnetic fields and by heating. Also, {{on a number of}} specimens a study was done both with thin sections and with polished sections. There proved to be general agreement between the properties of the characteristic NRM and the kind of Fe-Ti oxides in the lavas. In the case of specimens containing magnetite only the characteristic NRM was entirely removed at temperatures just below 600 °C, or in alternating fields up to 1500 / 2000 Oe peak value; on the other hand, in specimens containing both magnetite and a substantial part of hematite (<b>martite)</b> the final part of the characteristic remanence was removed at temperatures above 600 °C, and this remanence resisted alternating fields above 2000 Oe peak value. From the characteristic site-mean directions of 5 sites an average paleomagnetic direction is computed with D = 210. 8 °, 1 = 66. 9 °, and c 95 = 3. 9 °. This result might be taken as an indication that at the Devono-Carboniferous transition {{the southern part of the}} Alborz was located in the present Indian Ocean off the Arabian coast...|$|E

They consist of primary Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, ulvospinel, pleonaste, hematite and pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrohtite and secondary Ti-maghemite, <b>martite</b> and goethite. They exhibit granular mosaic texture with well-defined triple junctions characteristics of adcumulus rocks. The host ultramafic-mafic rocks show compositional igneous layering and cumulus texture. Pleonaste and ilmenite in Ti-magnetite become lensoid or rounded in outline due to deformation and regional upper amphibolite to lower granulite facies metamorphism. The ultramafic - mafic rocks and the assocd. V-Ti magnetite ores reveal an alkali poor tholeiitic trend with high degree iron enrichment. Ultramafic rocks fall in peridotite field and the gabbro-anorthosite rocks show tholeiitic trend and the V-Ti magnetite ores fall nearer to the tholeiitic field indicating their co-genetic relationship. MgO vs F plot exhibits a neg. correlation throughout the crystn. process. MgO decreases from 38. 42 to 21. 51 wt. % in ultramafic rocks and from 9. 55 to 2. 92 wt. % in gabbro-anorthosite suite of rocks and 0. 62 to 1. 40 in V-Ti magnetite ores indicating early crystn. of chromite, olivine, pyroxene, minor plagioclase followed by late crystn. of plagioclase and clinopyroxene giving rise to gabbro-anorthosite suite of rocks followed by ilmenite-rich magnetite.

A detailed microscopic analysis of the ores revealed that initially a compact magnetite/quartzite layer, detrital in character (the magnetite occasionally showing chromite cores), was deposited by entrapment in near shore lagoons where rivers debouched, {{rather than in the}} open sea.

40|$|The Lake Superior Region {{has been}} a {{producer}} of iron ore for over 150 years. Early mining operations concentrated on direct shipping ores, which {{are the result of}} post-depositional upgrading principally by deep weathering. As direct shipping ore reserves became depleted, the focus changed to the production of iron ore pellets from taconite. The post-depositional processes responsible for upgrading taconite are regional metamorphism, contact metamorphism and hydrothermal processes (Clout and Simonson, 2005). While these processes are important in iron ore genesis they can also contribute to liberation problems and in some instances reduced pellet quality (Han, 2004). Low-grade metamorphic mineral assemblages can negatively impact liberation and pellet quality. Low-grade iron formation may contain a suite of carbonate minerals including ankerite, dolomite, kutnohorite, siderite and magnesiosiderite. Variation in the distribution and composition of siderite and magnesiosiderite makes controlling the MgO content of pellets difficult. Carbonate minerals also require calcination in the pellet induration process, which requires additional heat {{to be added to the}} system, slowing down the induration process and reducing throughput. Prediction of carbonate mineralogy and carbonate mineral chemistry is an important goal of ore characterisation for pelletising properties. Contact metamorphism causes changes in mineralogy and grain size (Klein, 1973; Gunderson and Schwartz, 1962). Increasing the grain size of magnetite should improve its liberation characteristics. However, plant grinding targets may not allow the coarse-grained, more easily liberating magnetite ores to increase throughput and can actually result in decreased throughput due to recirculation. While magnetite and <b>martite</b> ores are well understood (Lukey, Johnson and Scott, 2007) late open-space filling microplaty haematite ores are not. These ores, while composed of similar minerals, have a unique genesis that results in fine grain size and complex textures that present liberation challenges and often make interpreting laboratory metallurgical test results more difficult...|$|E
