50|$|A {{specific}} {{sequence of}} tasks and start times (genes) represents one genome in our population. To {{make sure that}} our genome is a feasible solution we must take care that it obeys our precedence constraints. We generate an initial population using random start times within the precedence constraints. With genetic algorithms we then take this initial population and cross it, combining genomes along {{with a small amount of}} randomness (mutation). The offspring of this combination is selected based on a fitness function that includes one or many of our constraints, such as minimizing time and minimizing defects. We let this process continue either for a pre-allotted time or until we find a solution that fits our minimum criteria. Overall each successive generation will have a greater average fitness, i.e. taking less time with higher quality than the preceding generations. In scheduling problems, as with other genetic algorithm solutions, we must <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not select offspring that are infeasible, such as offspring that violate our precedence constraint. We of course may have to add further fitness values such as minimizing costs; however, each constraint that we add greatly increases the search space and lowers the number of solutions that are good matches.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the issues that}} the ongoing revolution in biosciences and biotechnology pose to social science. A convenient frame for examining these issues is the framework of ?thematic priorities? established by the British funding agency for social science, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). These ?thematic priorities? are used to identify major challenges and opportunities that currently confront social research. Though not constructed {{as part of a}} futures exercise, this framework proved useful for organising the issues that were generated from literature review and brainstorming, provided a stimulus to identify new issues, and was a useful filter for presenting results to the ESRC, which sponsored the study. This range of issues does not just call for interaction between natural and social scientists: there is also need for the sharing of knowledge and perspectives across diverse fields of social science. In order to help inform future research priorities, we need to move beyond the perspectives of single disciplines, and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not simply emphasise those areas where social scientists have already been actively engaged. The study concludes clearly that there is a huge range of vital questions that social science needs to address if we are to understand, let alone bring more social intelligence to bear on shaping, the scientific and technological revolutions that are under way, and their broader social implication...|$|E
40|$|Rail {{is a very}} {{expensive}} component of the railway track. Therefore, research methods extending rail life have great economic importance. During {{the past thirty years}} and, particularly during the past ten years there has been an increasing awareness throughout most rail networks {{in the world of the}} need to introduce improved design criteria, better construction techniques and higher standard track generally. This implies that quality control at all levels is mandatory if these objectives are to be achieved. With the improved understanding of degradation of track, a more complete comprehension of the costs associated with different operating and infrastructure conditions should also be developed, aiding in the determination of efficient maintenance costs and their contribution to access charges. Track and structures together account for 60 % of maintenance costs, with 50 % of the total being track. The UIC has done a lot of work on comparative performance indicators, and these show what potential savings much be out there for the taking, just by adopting current best practice. The old wisdom is that it's not enough o do things rights; we have to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the right things. These developments have largely resulted from the demand for higher speeds particularly in passenger services and the demand to accept heavier axle loads of freight traffic. Whilst the conventional railway track structure is not likely to change significantly over the next ten years there will be a requirement over that period for better quality track infrastructure. This means less rail surface defects, less internal defects and less wheels irregularities. The presence of rail surface defects generally increases the roughness of the track leading to a poor passenger ride and increased safety risk with freight traffic. In addition, rail surface defects will generally increase the degradation rate of other track components; however, not all defects will produce visible track deterioration. Dynamic impacts produced by the rollingstock running over rail surface defects, such as poor welds, will, over time, create continuous rail defects, loosening of fastenings, abrasion and skewing of sleepers, crushing of ballast and loss of formation geometry. It is only in the recent years that the importance of poor welds in track has been identified. Dips and peaks must be recognised as a severe track irregularity that needs to be addressed and removed. Current maintenance activities have little effect on removing misaligned welds in track and the improvement obtained after the maintenance works is generally short lived. On the other hand, straightening operations have proven to solve the problem and maintain the results following 7 months of traffic. As part of this project, a six kilometre test section was selected on the Mt Isa Line and all welds located in this region were monitored for over 9 months to increase the understanding of the effect of individual maintenance activities on the track roughness. Three 2 km Divisions were established; each Division had different maintenance activities and levels of intervention completed over the duration of the project. Over 15, 000 readings were recorded and analysed. The following conclusions were drawn. The effect of cycle tamping was clearly identified when comparing the means of weld located in Division 1, 2 to the mean of welds in Division 3. Cycle tamping showed to have a significant positive effect on the dipped welds geometry and an increase in severity of peaked welds prior to their correction. Straightening operations completed in Division 1 and 2 reduced the overall mean of weld misalignments. These Divisions were subjected to different levels of straightening intervention however they produced similar results. Division 1 all dips were straightened and Division 2 only dips > 0. 3 mm were straightened. This means that no additional benefit, in terms of overall misalignment of welds, can be gained when straightening operations target dips with a misalignment smaller than 0. 3 mm. Cycle grinding proved to have little effect on the removal of both dips and peaks. In fact, due to the configuration of the grinding machine, grinding operation produced a slight worsening of the dips misalignments and only a minor improvement of peaks. Although long term monitoring of the site may show minor variations in weld geometry performance, after approximately 3. 9 Mgt of traffic the mean of dipped welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening. Furthermore, the mean of peaked welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening...|$|E
40|$|Protecting {{commercial}} poultry farms Cue: When avian flu first {{broke out in}} Africa, the outbreaks occurred not in backyard birds, but in {{commercial poultry}} flocks. For the owners of large poultry farms, the impact of an avian flu outbreak is devastating. Not only are all their birds slaughtered, but often the public loses confidence in poultry products and the whole poultry sector is affected. Keeping commercial poultry farms free of disease, by tight controls and good hygiene practices is therefore essential. In Malawi the government has established three avian flu rapid response teams, for the three regions of the country. It has also run training workshops for those involved in rearing poultry. Mr Jampa Banda, owner of Tiyanjane Poultry farm near Blantyre, has attended several such workshops. He told Patrick Mphaka about what he is now doing to prevent the disease affecting his farm. IN:		?In general, avian flu can be prevented ?? OUT:		??and that will be terrible. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Jampa Banda, a commercial poultry farmer, was telling Patrick Mphaka about the measures {{that have been taken}} to protect his farm from the risk of avian flu. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Banda	In general, avian flu can be prevented through general cleanliness starting from the infrastructure itself, that?s the cages, as well as the personal hygiene involving all those individuals working in the poultry farm. Mphaka	What changes can I see now if I am to visit and see some of the cages around, see how the chicks are doing? Banda	There are several things which have been implemented. One is the change in the strategy in terms of raising the flocks. Initially we used to have a single flock mixed with the other flocks, may be younger ones, but now, we have to sell one lot before we introduce another one. That?s a major change which is obviously affecting our production, since now we are taking much longer to produce one lot of a flock. Again, we have improved the general hygiene around the poultry farm whereby cleanliness is now taken as a priority to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not contaminate the flocks. And another measure which has been implemented is making sure that the individuals working in the poultry farm don?t keep any poultry at their homes. Now it is like a serious measure which has to be checked. So it?s a general consensus that each worker who is involved in taking care of the flocks should never keep any poultry at his home. And we are also restricting any passers-by {{to make sure that they}} do not contaminate our flock or the farm at large. So it?s like a restricted site, much more serious these days than ever before. Mphaka	It must be a big challenge, I suppose, for the workers whom you have because I have seen that as a big poultry farmer, you have some of your workers who stay within the farm itself, they have their houses there, and most of them must have been keeping some poultry themselves. Was there a party where they had to slaughter all their chickens? Banda	Not necessarily a party, but it was a general understanding that if we do not implement these measures, then we both lose; I as the farmer, as well as the workers themselves, eventually we were going to end up both losers. Mphaka	I suppose it must be very hard to follow such rules when you know that avian flu is just something we hear about, it has not hit Malawi yet. How faithful or committed can people be getting such instructions for something they have not seen? Banda	Knowing how dangerous this avian flu can be, then no chances can be spared. As such, each one of us understands that once we are hit, then there will be no escape, that is why we have taken this disease very seriously and we do not want to take any chances. Mphaka	When we were coming in here, before entering, you made sure that I removed my shoes outside and then you disinfected me. How can that help, knowing that there are birds all over around and if any one of them is contaminated or infected, they can come right inside your farm? Banda	There are some measures by which we make sure that the disease never gets into the farm. Some of them are obviously to make sure that our flocks are always kept enclosed in their cages. And we also keep on checking if at all there are any intruding birds coming in; and those are obviously chased out before they can even have a chance to contaminate our flock. But if at all we see any suspicious bird, maybe being weak, or whatever, we make sure that it is immediately quarantined and a veterinary officer called to make sure that he assists and check whatever is happening. Mphaka	Do you believe it will ever come to Malawi, looking at the measures which some of you have taken up and have instituted? Banda	It?s a tricky situation. We definitely do not want to take things for granted and we can not cheat ourselves by saying it will never come here. It was introduced in other areas, therefore, it can as well be introduced in Malawi. That is why we are taking every opportunity to prevent it from coming whilst making sure that if possible, even if it comes, but at least my farm should not be affected by making sure that we implement that advice which has been given by the government. If it ever comes, then it can definitely be a disaster because apart from losing the market, obviously the economy will be affected since people will definitely be terrified and they would not buy even those chickens which are not affected, and that will definitely be very bad for everyone, loss of jobs, loss of business, and that will be terrible.
