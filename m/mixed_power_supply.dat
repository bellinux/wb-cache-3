40|$|For {{a secure}} {{integration}} of weather dependent renewable energies in Germany's <b>mixed</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> precise forecasts of expected wind power are indispensable. These in turn are {{heavily dependent on}} numerical weather prediction (NWP). With this relevant area of application, NWP models need to be evaluated concerning new variables such as wind speed at hub heights of wind power plants. This article presents verification results of the deterministic NWP forecasts of the global ICON model, its ICON-EU nest, the COSMO-EU, and the COSMO-DE {{as well as of}} the ensemble prediction system COSMO-DE-EPS of the German National Weather Service (DWD), against wind mast observations. The focus is on the diurnal cycle in the Planetary Boundary Layer as wind power forecasts for Germany exhibit pronounced systematic amplitude and phase errors in the morning and evening hours. NWP forecasts with lead times up to 48 hours are examined. All considered NWP models reveal shortcomings concerning the representation of the diurnal cycle. Especially in summertime at onshore locations, when Low-Level Jets form, nocturnal wind speeds at hub height are underestimated. In the COSMO model, stable conditions are not sufficiently reflected in the first part of the night and the vertical mixing after sunrise establishes too late. The verification results of the COSMO-DE-EPS confirm the deficiencies of the deterministic forecasts. The deficiencies are present in all ensemble members and thus indicate potential for improvement not only in the model physics parameterization but also concerning the physical ensemble perturbations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> noise, {{which is}} the {{variation}} in the supply voltage across the on-die supply terminals of VLSI circuits, is a serious performance degrader in digital circuits and mixed analog-digital circuits. In digital VLSI systems, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise causes timing errors such as delays, jitter, and false switching. In microprocessors, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise reduces the maximum operating frequency (FMAX) of the CPU. In <b>mixed</b> analog-digital circuits, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise manifests as the substrate noise and impairs {{the performance of the}} analog portion. The decrease in the available noise margin with the decrease in the feature size of transistors in CMOS systems makes the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise a very serious issue, and demands new methods to reduce the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise in sub-micron CMOS systems. In this thesis, we develop a new method to determine optimal time-delays between the switching of input/output (I/O) data buffers in digital VLSI systems that realizes maximum reduction of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise. We first discuss methods to characterize the distributed nature of the Power Delivery Network (PDN) in the frequency-domain. We then develop an analytical method to determine the optimal delays using the frequency-domain response of the PDN and the supply current spectrum of the buffer units. We explain the mechanism behind the cancellation of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise by the introduction of optimal buffer-to-buffer delays. We also develop a numerical method to determine the optimal delays and compare it with the analytical method. We illustrate the reduction in the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise by applying the optimal time-delays determined using our methods to two examples of PDN. Our method has great potential to realize maximum reduction of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise in digital VLSI circuits and substrate noise in mixed analog-digital VLSI circuits. Lower <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise translates into lower cost and improved performance of the circuit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Supply {{noise is}} a {{significant}} problem in RF systems where it can mix with RF signals, degrading signal/noise ratios and potentially causing violation of spectral masks. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} supply rejection properties of RF amplifiers. We extend a conventional Volterra-series formulation to treat multiport systems and use it to describe the <b>mixing</b> products between <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise and the RF carrier. It is shown that a multiport Volterra formulation can be used to treat weak nonlinearities in the system and that the nonsymmetric cross terms accurately predict low-order mixing phenomenon. We demonstrate the validity of our hand analysis through the design and fabrication of a power amplifier in 180 -nm CMOS, operating between 900 MHz– 2. 4 GHz with a maximum output power of 15 dBm. Spectral regrowth of singletone and EDGE modulation waveforms is shown to match within 1 - 3 dB across frequency and input signal power. Importantly, this analysis provides insight into the circuit-level mechanisms for susceptibility to <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> noise and can help designers improve the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> rejection ratio robustness of system-on-chip wireless blocks and transmitter architectures.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{proposes a}} AC and DC <b>mixed</b> output VPS(vehicle <b>power</b> <b>supply).</b> It is {{composed}} of a two-stage circuit with the input stage and the output stage. The input stage contains a single-phase PWM inverter, a HFT (high-frequency transformer) and an uncontrolled rectifier. The single-phase PWM inverter adopts the open-loop control strategy to convert the low DC voltage into a high-frequency one with square wave. The HFT enhances the voltage and insulates the low-voltage side from the high-voltage side. The uncontrolled rectifier transforms the square voltage into DC voltage. In the output stage, one output uses single-phase PWM inverter and the other uses a DC chopper, both of which adopt the double-loop PWM control mode. The mode consists of an outer voltage loop and an inner current loop to produce desirable voltage and power. With the two-stage control strategy, ideal output currents and the output voltages are obtained, and the input power factor is controllable. The VPS model is established on MATLAB/SIMULINK, and this system is also implemented in laboratory based on DSP TMS 320 F 28335.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor.

Microfiche. xii, 147 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} alternative approach for determining the optimal mix of Japan's electric power sources through a multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. The present priority of Japan's electric power industry is to attain the optimal <b>mix</b> of <b>power</b> sources. In determining such an optimal <b>mix,</b> the electric <b>power</b> industry recognizes the significance of an approach that considers security of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{in the future and}} environmental aspects, but the emphasis has still been placed on economic aspects only. Most of the fuels used for generating power in Japan are imported from overseas. In other words, future <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> depends heavily on overseas sources. Emissions from the thermal power plants have caused the "greenhouse effect" and "acid rain. " Recently, the agitation against nuclear power development is accelerating throughout the country, concerning the safety of nuclear power plants. Therefore, the electric power industry should consider security of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (strategic aspect), emission problems (environmental aspect), and public opinion on safety (social aspect) in addition to the economic aspects in determining the optimal <b>mix</b> of <b>power</b> sources. In this study, a multi-objective programming model is developed for the determination of optimal <b>mix</b> of <b>power</b> sources with special attention to economic, technological, and institutional conditions. Since it is difficult to predict future conditions due to uncertainties such as changes in technology, natural disasters, changes in values, and other unforeseeable changes, scenario analysis is utilized in this study. As this problem belongs to the domain of public decision making which contains a wide range of interest groups (decision makers), it is desirable that the optimal solutions satisfy the conditions of equity as well as efficiency. In this study, the Rawlsian equity criterion and the utilitarian equity criterion are considered to attain the optimal <b>mix</b> of <b>power</b> sources.
