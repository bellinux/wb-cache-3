Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case}} of EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E

Later in 2006 former United States Ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci agreed with this position; however, the succeeding ambassador, David Wilkins, stated that the Northwest Passage was in international waters.|$|E

25|$|Evans {{continued}} to use his Ojibwe orthography in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had {{a large number of}} syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> awkward for his students to use.|$|E
25|$|In January 1965, Secretary McNamara {{asked the}} Air Force to {{consider}} a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and close air support to replace several types like the F-100 Super Sabre and various light bombers then in service. Two basic designs could fill this role; the Navy favored designs like the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II, pure attack aircraft, while the Air Force {{was more interested in}} fighters like the Northrop F-5, fighters with a secondary attack capability. The former were more capable in the attack role, while the latter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> so but could defend themselves. If the Air Force did choose an attack design, maintaining air superiority would be a top priority. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to obsolete MiG-15s or MiG-17s on 4 April 1965.|$|E

Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon at RapReviews gave the {{production on}} the album a perfect 10 of 10 rating, particularly praising tracks like [...] "So Many Tears" [...] and [...] "Temptations". Jon Pareles of the New York Times remarked that the production had a [...] "fatalistic calm, in a commercial mold". He compared the album's production and synthesized hooks to that of Dr. Dre's G-funk style, stating that [...] "while 2Pac doesn't sing, other voices do, providing smooth melody". James Bernard at Entertainment Weekly was not quite as enthusiastic about the album's production, remarking that Shakur's [...] "vocals are buried deep in the mix.

500|$|The author goes on {{to explain}} how {{individuals}} were attracted to Dianetics, the precursor to Scientology. Wallis notes, [...] " [...] offered a rationale for failure in social mobility and in social interaction. It provided an explanation in terms of traumatic incidents {{in which the individual}} had been unwittingly involved, and thereby relieved him of responsibility for his failure." [...] Scientologists who participated in a questionnaire for Wallis' research identified areas of their life that they hoped Scientology would improve, including: loneliness, financial difficulties, marital issues, other interpersonal relationships, psychological problems, and physical illness. Wallis describes Hubbard's thought process to turn his methodology of Dianetics into a religion, noting, [...] "Hubbard's theory and techniques had been moving increasingly in this direction". Wallis notes how Scientology became a focus for those previously involved in the Dianetics movement. Wallis points out that Hubbard instructed members of Scientology not to immediately tell new followers about methodologies that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> familiar to some, such as belief in the existence of prior lives.|$|E

I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> likely to return for the sequel.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{commented on}} the {{differences}} between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as [...] "heavier, darker, more experimental {{and a lot more}} consistent" [...] than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as [...] "downright commercial in a way that none of the duo's previous projects have been". He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced". Although not considering Free to be as [...] "enthralling" [...] as Head Control System, he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|E
500|$|As {{the dual}} sex naming of {{tropical}} cyclones {{started in the}} Northern Hemisphere, the NZMS considered adding ethnic Pacific names to the naming lists rather than the European names that were currently used. As {{a result of the}} many languages and cultures in the Pacific {{there was a lot of}} discussion surrounding this matter, with one name, [...] "Oni," [...] being dropped as it meant [...] "the end of the world" [...] in one language. One proposal suggested that cyclones be named from the country nearest to which they formed; however, this was dropped when it was realized that a cyclone <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> destructive in its formative stage than later in its development. Eventually it was decided to combine names from all over the South Pacific into a single list at a training course, where each course member provided a list of names that were short, easily pronounced, culturally acceptable throughout the Pacific and did not contain any idiosyncrasies. These names were then collated, edited for suitability, and cross-checked with the group for acceptability. It was intended that the four lists of names should be alphabetical with alternating male and female names while using only ethnic names. However, it was not possible to complete the lists using only ethnic names. As a result, there was a scattering of European names in the final lists, which have been used by the Fiji Meteorological Service and NZMS since the 1980–81 season. During October 1985 the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center had to request an additional list, after the names preselected for that season was used up. As a result, the names Xina, York, Zelda, Xavier, Yolanda, Zeke were subsequently added to the naming lists, while a contingency plan of using the Greek alphabet if all of the names were used up was introduced.|$|E

2500|$|Lionfish have {{successfully}} pioneered the coastal {{waters of the}} Atlantic {{in less than a}} decade and pose a major threat to reef ecological systems in these areas. A study comparing their abundance from Florida to North Carolina with several species of groupers found [...] they were second only to the native scamp grouper and equally abundant to the graysby, gag, and rock hind. This could be due to a surplus of resource availability resulting from the overfishing of lionfish predators like grouper. Although the lionfish has not expanded to a population size [...] currently causing major ecological problems, their invasion in the United States coastal waters could lead to serious problems in the future. One likely ecological impact caused by Pterois could be their impact on prey population numbers by directly affecting food web relationships. This could ultimately lead to reef deterioration and could negatively influence Atlantic trophic cascade. Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than desirable.|$|E
2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into invasive cancer.|$|E
2500|$|If the Dutch Republicans {{wanted an}} example of a Prince who fomented trouble by foreign {{military}} adventures {{to the detriment of the}} common good, they only had to point across the English Channel to the uncle of the Prince of Orange, Charles II of England. Charles had been restored to the throne of his father in 1660, after first apparently making his peace with the Dutch regents, who had treated him so scornfully after 1654. The end of the Protectorate in [...] England had given the Dutch regents hope that the new English regime <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> bellicose than the Commonwealth. To ensure the good graces of Charles he was extensively fêted during his stay in the Netherlands before his triumphant return to England. It was hoped that the Dutch Gift would further mellow his feelings toward the Dutch, maybe even persuade him to rescind the Navigation Acts. Charles took the opportunity to further the interests of his sister Mary and nephew William (now ten years old) by emphasizing his great affection for both. The Orangists, of course, needed little encouragement to add this to their quiver of arguments in favor of dynastic preferment. But also many opportunistic States-Party regents, discerning a change in the wind, started to make pro-Orange noises, especially in the Amsterdam vroedschap. This disturbed De Witt no end, as he feared that this would undermine the position of his party.|$|E
