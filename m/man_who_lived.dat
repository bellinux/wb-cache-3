5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Tanner {{told the}} police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man {{carrying}} a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine's bedroom, heading east, away {{from the front of}} apartment 5A. In {{the early days of the}} investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first arguido.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} continues investigating {{leads into}} the Adena Watson case, including an interrogation of a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> {{within walking distance}} of the scene and was previously charged with murdering a 14-year-old girl. All of the leads turn into dead ends. While investigating the Adena Watson scene, police find coagulated blood and hair on a piece of metal. Battel witnesses the find, but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it, as long as she gets the story first. She also tells Bayliss about a carry-out store owner who claims to know who the murderer is. The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson's funeral.|$|E

25|$|From March 1943, British Intelligence {{had been}} trying to find Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's {{headquarters}} in France. Part of the brief looked at creating a timetable for Rommel, to assess how easy it would be to kill him. Much as though he had been against the plan pre-D-Day, with manpower losses escalating Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery approved the plan post D-Day, even though they still didn't know where Rommel's base was. In a bizarre coincidence, on 9 June SAS Lieutenant General was heading for a meeting with a French Resistance unit. Resting in a barn, he was approached by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in La Roche-Guyon, asking for assurances that as Rommel's headquarters was in the village, that the Royal Air Force would not bomb them.|$|E
25|$|The Paviland {{limestone}} caves of the Gower Peninsula {{in south}} Wales {{are by far}} the richest source of Aurignacian material in Britain, including burins and scrapers dated to about 28,500 years ago. The first remains of modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens to be found in Wales was the famous Red Lady of Paviland. This was a human skeleton dyed in red ochre discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland caves. Despite the name, the skeleton is actually that of a young <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> about 33,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} Upper Paleolithic Period (old stone age). He is considered to be the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe. The skeleton was found along with fragments of small cylindrical ivory rods, fragments of ivory bracelets and seashells.|$|E

The Red Lady of Paviland, a human skeleton dyed in red ochre, was discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland limestone caves of the Gower Peninsula in Swansea, South Wales.

25|$|Burwell {{became more}} {{important}} than Reach when T. T. Ball opened the Burwell Chemical Works, which was built between 1864 and 1865. Fertilizer was produced from coprolites, ancient fossilised dung extracted from the newly drained fens, using a process which had been developed by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> locally. The works became the Patent Manure Works in the 1890s, and following a partnership, was owned by Colchester and Ball, who ran a fleet of three steam tugs {{and a large number}} of lighters, which were carrying around 10,000 tons a year by the early 20th century, {{despite the fact that the}} works had been served by a railway siding since 1900. Richard Ball had opened a brickworks nearby, which was served by a channel which became known as Factory Lode.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{began playing}} guitar {{at the age}} of 12. He learned how to play from an elderly <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> down the road, who died before he moved. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from Huntington Beach, California to Claremont. His playing began {{improving}} by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown and Paul Gilbert. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007–2008.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the legend}} {{said that there}} was a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> under the reign of King Wu of Zhou; his name was Zhang Fu De.

When he was 7 years old, he already learned old Chinese Classics and empathized the poor. Zhang Fu De became a {{government}} tax officer when he was 36 and he was a wise and good officer and people loved him.

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|Qiao Xuan {{later became}} the Chancellor (相) of the Qi State (齊國; in present-day Shandong). He once {{committed}} an offence and was stripped off his post and sent to perform hard labour. After serving his sentence, {{he was allowed to}} rejoin the civil service and appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shanggu Commandery (上谷郡) and later as the Administrator of Hanyang Commandery (漢陽郡). While he was in office, Qiao Xuan heard that Huangfu Zhen (皇甫禎), the Prefect (令) of Shanggui County (上邽縣), was guilty of corruption. He had Huangfu Zhen arrested, flogged, and head shaved bald. Huangfu Zhen later died in Ji County (兾縣). This incident shocked everyone in the region. Around the time, Qiao Xuan heard of Jiang Qi (姜岐), a famous <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in Shanggui County, and wanted to recruit him to join the civil service. Jiang Qi claimed that he was ill and declined. Qiao Xuan was angered, so he sent Yin Yi (尹益) to pressure Jiang Qi into agreeing. He threatened to make Jiang Qi's mother marry another man if he refused again. Yin Yi conveyed Qiao Xuan's threat to Jiang Qi but Jiang still declined and claimed that he was sick. The Counsellors (士大夫) in the commandery came to see Qiao Xuan and managed to persuade him to stop forcing Jiang Qi. This incident became the subject of jokes at the time. Qiao Xuan resigned on the grounds that he was ill. Shortly after, he joined the civil service again as a Chief Clerk (長史) to the Excellency of Works (司徒). He was subsequently promoted to Court Architect (將作大匠).|$|E
500|$|Later in 1948, six {{courses were}} led {{by members of the}} {{national}} BSA staff, with one at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation and another at Philmont Scout Ranch.

Schuck, was a training enthusiast. He felt Wood Badge would be a great opportunity to train selected men who could return to their local councils and train others. Schuck was so enthusiastic about the Wood Badge course that he was responsible for sending invitations using his signature from his office to every participant.|$|E

500|$|S {{director}} J. T. Petty {{originally intended}} {{the film to}} focus on a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> near his childhood home; the man often spied on, and filmed, his neighbors. The footage led to an indictment towards [...] "the peeper", who recorded 191 videotapes of Petty's childhood neighborhood. The indictment implied the footage should be viewed in court, but the people in the neighborhood opposed this owing to privacy concerns. Petty said of the 191 videotapes, [...] "I admired the peeping tom; he had made movies that were frightening and titillating and real." [...] The idea of using a camera to record his neighbor's house for hours fascinated him so much that he decided to direct a film about it. Although he had already secured funding, Petty was left without a subject since [...] "the peeper" [...] {{wanted nothing to do with}} the film. Petty decided to focus on three directors, who did not direct films aimed at the general public; they directed simulated snuff films, involving murder and sexual assault. Petty found the directors— Zebub, Vogel, and Marcisak, Petty's friend who played the fictional director Rost— at the Chiller Convention, an underground horror event.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 9:30p.m., on {{the night}} of August 29, 2002, Corporal Arnaud and Deputy Magruder arrived at the residence of James Ramiah Logan, a 23-year-old <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> at his parents' single-story rambler house at 9332 Lynmont Drive in Adelphi, Maryland, near the Buck Lodge Middle School. According to departmental protocol, they were to arrive at the house with a third deputy, however, none were available at the time. They were to serve a petition to have an emergency psychiatric evaluation performed on Logan. Earlier in the day, Logan's wife, Valencia Flood, fearing for her safety and the safety of her children, filed the petition with the judicial system to have her husband receive treatment, saying that Logan was [...] "paranoid" [...] and that he [...] "needs to be hospitalized immediately" [...] as [...] "his condition was worsening". The petition entailed the deputies taking Logan to a hospital, where he would have his psychiatric health examined by medical personnel. A few days earlier, on August 26, Logan had been examined by a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and recommended that he be admitted to a medical institution to receive treatment for his mental health. Logan adamantly believed that he was in sound mental health and refused to consent to any such treatment, and as such, he was not admitted to such an institution and was released.|$|E
