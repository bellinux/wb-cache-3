40|$|Electron {{transfer}} (ET) {{reactions are}} essential for life since they underpin oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis, processes leading to the generation of ATP, and are involved in many reactions of intermediary metabolism 1. Key to these roles is the formation of transient inter-protein ET complexes. The structural basis for the control of specificity between partner proteins is lacking since these weak transient complexes have remained largely intractable for crystallographic studies 2, 3. Inter-protein ET processes are central {{to all of the}} key steps of denitrification, an alternative form of respiration in which bacteria reduce nitrate or nitrite to N 2 via the gaseous intermediates nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) when oxygen concentrations are limiting. The one electron reduction of nitrite to NO, a precursor to N 2 O, is performed by either a heme- or copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) where they receive an electron from redox partner proteins a cupredoxin or a c-type cytochrome 4, 5. Here we report the structures of the newly characterized three-domain hemec-Cu nitrite reductase from Ralstonia pickettii (RpNiR) at 1. 01 Å resolution and its M 92 A and P 93 A <b>mutains.</b> Very high resolution provides the first view of the atomic detail of the interface between the core trimeric cupredoxi...|$|R
