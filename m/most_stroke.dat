40|$|Atherosclerosis, {{the primary}} {{pathological}} condition accounting for <b>most</b> <b>stroke</b> syndromes, {{has been the}} intense focus of epidemiological, basic, and clinical investigations. Since these studies have direct bearing on the prevention of atherothrombotic brain infarction, this review emphasizes those advances in treatment resulting from their findings. The two most prominent theories on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis relate to aberrations in lipoprotein metabolism and to enhanced proliferation of smooth muscle cells; likely, the theories are complementary. As a practical guideline for preventive therapy, the importance of using the total cholesterol level is stressed, although finer distinctions must rely on the low-density and high-density lipoprotein concentrations and their normalization. Since prevention of stroke may ultimately be its most effective therapy, consideration of cholesterol level, akin to strategies for preventing coronary heart disease, and efforts to avert platelet adhesion or aggregation and coagulation are warranted...|$|E
30|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} the remaining classes of stroke treatment medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor (AGTR 2) antagonists, and statins are also affected by genetic variation in metabolic genes, {{as well as in}} genes encoding the drug’s main targets and proteins involved in the signaling cascades (Table  3). <b>Most</b> <b>stroke</b> patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors for blood pressure control and the anti-inflammatory effects that reduce the risk of stroke recurrence [21, 60]. ACE inhibitors have known ADRs, including hypokalemia and drug-induced dry cough and can be substituted with AGTR 2 antagonists. Occasionally, administration of ACE or AGTR 2 blockers even at the maximal therapeutic doses is insufficient to control hypertension. In such cases, additional medication is prescribed alongside a high dose of ACE or angiotensin II receptor blockers.

40|$|Objective. Despite {{widespread}} {{interest in}} many jurisdictions in monitoring {{and improving the}} quality of stroke care delivery, benchmarks for <b>most</b> <b>stroke</b> performance indicators have not been established. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop data-derived benchmarks for acute stroke quality indicators. Design. Nine key acute stroke quality indicators were selected from the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Performance Measures Manual. Participants. A population-based retrospective sample of patients discharged from 142 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 (N = 3191) was used to calculate hospital rates of performance and benchmarks. Intervention. The Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC™) methodology was used to create benchmarks based on the perform-ance of the upper 15 % of patients in the top-performing hospitals. Main Outcome Measures. Benchmarks were calculated for rates of neuroimaging, carotid imaging, stroke unit admission, dys-phasia screening and administration of stroke-related medications. Results.

40|$|Background: Patients who wake {{up having}} {{experienced}} a stroke while asleep represent around 20 % of acute stroke admissions. According to international {{guidelines for the}} management of acute stroke, patients presenting with wake-up stroke are not currently eligible to receive revascularization treatments. In this study, we aimed to assess the opinions of stroke experts about the management of patients with wake-up stroke by using an international multicenter electronic survey. Method: This study consisted of 8 questions on wake-up stroke treatment. Results: Two hundred invitations to participate in the survey were sent by e-mail. Fifty-nine participants started the survey, 4 dropped out before completing it, and 55 completed the full questionnaire. We had 55 participants from 22 countries. Conclusions: In this study, <b>most</b> <b>stroke</b> experts recommended a recanalization treatment for wake-up stroke.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the stroke records of consecutive patients admitted to the SRU between May-November 2002 and April-November 2004 was performed applying the UK National Sentinel Audit of Stroke (NSAS) tool. RESULTS: The results of the study reveal that while SRU processes of care was 74 % compliant with standards; compliance with stroke service organisational standards was only 15 and 43 % in the RGH and SRU, respectively.

30|$|Transcranial {{color-coded}} sonography (TCCS) is a feasible, fast, and non-invasive bedside {{method for}} the evaluation of cerebral arteries in acute stroke, and it is a routine tool in <b>most</b> <b>stroke</b> units. Particularly when contrast agents are applied, TCCS is valid compared with computed tomography (CT) angiography [14] and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [15] for the diagnosis of arterial occlusions in patients with acute ischemic stroke, especially in middle cerebral artery (MCA) obstructions [16]. According to the ‘Neurosonology in Acute Ischemic Stroke study’, TCCS is an independent predictor for stroke patient's outcome [17]. Assessment of vascular pathology and hemodynamics in patients with acute stroke is thought to enable early judgment of functional outcome and thrombolytic efficacy and could identify patients who might benefit from interventional treatment [18 – 20]. In our study, we focused TCCS examination on the detection of middle cerebral artery occlusion in its proximal segment (M 1 -MCA occlusions) - the most common site for cerebral artery occlusions - since we hope to shorten time from symptom onset to beginning of therapy with a very early diagnostic approach.|$|E
