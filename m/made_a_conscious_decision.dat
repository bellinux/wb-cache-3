5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|West <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> {{to abstain}} from the {{widespread}} recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E
50|$|The early Tudor {{concern with}} {{traditional}} history was Arthurian, {{as evidenced by}} the name chosen for Arthur, Prince of Wales. Henry VIII <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> political <b>decision</b> of 1533 to identify instead with the Constantine figure. The Constantine connection with the Tudors had been laid out by John Rous, in work taken up by Robert Fabyan and then John Rastell. As a consequence Polydore Vergil was allowed to publish his Historia Anglicana in 1534, a work dismissive of the Arthurian matter, but supporting the British origins of Helena. He also imported a tradition linking Claudius Gothicus with the Constantinian dynasty, significant for Tudor hereditary claims.|$|R
40|$|The vote to Leave {{is usually}} {{explained}} {{along the lines}} of voters’ socio-economic background. But by focussing on their circumstances it is as if we see voters as a manipulated group rather than as individuals who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> free and <b>conscious</b> <b>decision,</b> explains Alexis Papazoglou. Regardless of how one chooses to explain the result, key Leave campaign promises were false, and so a general election, where parties set out detailed and costed plans for citizens to decide on, must be the next step...|$|R
5000|$|From the start, Hill {{envisioned a}} more improvisational film than he'd ever before created. [...] "The story is {{traditional}} urban thriller: two terrible guys {{are out there}} {{and have to be}} brought down," [...] he said. [...] "But even though I enjoy working in genres, the point is always to explode them or give them a transfusion. So I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> very <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to go with the elements of personality of the two players, rather than be overly genuflective to the narrative. Thrusting a white policeman and a black convict together carries so much gravity that we didn't have to beat the white-black thing to death. If it works, it's because of the actors' personalities." [...] Hill's first choice after Richard Pryor was Gregory Hines. When he was not available, Hill's then-girlfriend Hildy Gottlieb recommended her client, Eddie Murphy, then best known for his work on Saturday Night Live. The character of Reggie Hammond was originally named Willie Biggs, but Eddie Murphy felt that was too stereotypical of a black man's name and changed it to Reggie Hammond.|$|R

Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided {{to create a new}} line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients. It commissioned Executive Chef Andrew Selvaggio to create the Deluxe line of burgers including the Fish Filet Deluxe, Grilled Chicken Deluxe, Crispy Chicken Deluxe, and the flagship Arch Deluxe.|$|E

In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum. During that time, she was reunited with her youngest brother Kim, who had fled Cambodia to Thailand and was brought to France via Germany {{with the help of}} his Aunt Heng in 1985.

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Red Army {{pushed the}} Eastern Front towards Lithuania. The Soviets invaded and {{occupied}} Lithuania {{by the end of}} 1944. As forced conscription into Red Army and Stalinist repressions intensified, thousands of Lithuanians used forests in the countryside as a natural refuge. These spontaneous groups became more organized and centralized culminating in the establishment of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters in February 1948. In their documents, the partisans emphasized that their ultimate goal is recreation of independent Lithuania. As the partisan war continued, {{it became clear that the}} West would not interfere in Eastern Europe (see Western betrayal) and that the partisans had no chance of success against the far stronger opponent. Eventually, the partisans <b>made</b> <b>an</b> explicit and <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> not to accept any new members. The leadership of the partisans was destroyed in 1953 thus effectively ending the partisan war, though individual fighters held out until the 1960s.|$|R
500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> very <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|R
25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to use Holinshed more {{frequently}} during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why {{he may have}} done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major {{difference between the two}} that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

In 423, a defence line over 2,000 li (...) long {{was built to}} resist the Rouran; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia. In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing, passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng, and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River.

500|$|Streep <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> not to {{play the}} part as a direct {{impression}} of Wintour, right down to not using an accent and making the character American rather than English ("I felt it was too restricting"). [...] "I think she wanted people not to confuse the character of Miranda Priestly with Anna Wintour at all," [...] said Frankel. [...] "And that's why {{early on in the}} process she decided on a very different look for her and a different approach to the character."

500|$|The Super Furry Animals <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> {{to make a}} commercial-sounding [...] "pop jukebox" [...] {{record with}} 1999's Guerrilla.

The band blamed their record label, Creation, for the relative failure of the singles—particularly [...] "Northern Lites", which they felt [...] "could have been bigger" [...] if the label had produced a better music video and conducted a more successful marketing campaign. As a result, the group became tired of playing [...] "chart games" [...] and went on [...] "pop strike", deciding to release music just [...] "for the joy of it", with no agenda.|$|E

I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{conceived}} as a [...] "rowdy pop record", both in response to Rough Trade's request for [...] "one of those pop records like you used to make" [...] {{and as a result}} of the [...] "very different atmosphere" [...] the band encountered at shows on the Love Kraft tour when the 'slow' songs from that album were played. In contrast with many Super Furry Animals albums, no samplers were used during recording of Hey Venus! as the group <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to create a [...] "simple record" [...] which [...] "capture the spirit of the band playing live in a room". Dave Newfeld took over production duties from Mario Caldato Jr., who had worked on both Phantom Power and Love Kraft, as the band didn't want to [...] "repeat [...] past two records". As with Love Kraft, all members of the band contributed songs at the recording stage but, besides chief songwriter Gruff Rhys, only guitarist Huw Bunford ("Battersea Odyssey") and keyboard player Cian Ciaran ("Carbon Dating") ended up with their tracks on the finished album.|$|E

At just over 36 minutes, the album is the shortest full-length release by the band. Some of the songs left off the record were [...] "really heavy and raw" [...] {{as a result of}} which Gruff Rhys feels Hey Venus! is [...] "more consistent with our back catalogue". Both lead single [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] and [...] "Suckers!" [...] were originally cut from the album, for being [...] "too generic" [...] and too [...] "obvious ... melodically" [...] respectively, until the band were persuaded to reconsider. Rough Trade Records boss Geoff Travis told the group that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] was his favourite song and, following the tracks reworking to include a French horn part, it was reinstated.

500|$|Some {{hardcore}} punk bands <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> {{to avoid}} putting Reagan in their lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, [...] Washington, D.C. musician Ian MacKaye, {{who was in}} the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi during the Reagan years, has said, [...] "I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs". In the late 1980s U.S. skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction within the New York hardcore scene, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the antiestablishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When the drunk-rock group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song [...] "California Pipeline," [...] fans could take it as either actual pro-Republican patriotism, or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti-Reagan irony. By the late 1980s, reference to Reagan in hardcore music had become so commonplace that the joke was no longer on the president, but on a punk scene where bands were practically obliged to put a Reagan song on their setlist or album.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously."
