40|$|Titanium is characterised by two {{contrasting}} aspects: outstanding {{combination of}} properties and high production costs which confine {{its application to}} high demanding sectors. The employment of powder metallurgy (P/M) techniques is one creative alternative to lower the final costs of titanium products due to some intrinsic advantages of P/M such as high yield of material and limited <b>machining</b> <b>requirement.</b> In this work the performances of hydride&-dehydride (HDH) and sponge elemental titanium products obtained by cold uniaxial pressing and sintering are compared.

40|$|Blisk is an {{essential}} component in aero engines. To maintain good aero-dynamic performance, one critical <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> for blades on blisk is that the generated five-axis tool path should be boundary-conformed. For a blade discretely modeled as a point cloud or mesh, most existing popular tool path generation methods are unable to meet this requirement. To address this issue, a novel five-axis tool path generation method for a discretized blade on blisk is presented in this paper. An idea called Linear Morphing Cone (LMC) is first proposed, which sets the boundary of the blade as the constraint. Based on this LMC, a CC curve generation and expansion method is then proposed with the specified machining accuracy upheld. Using the proposed tool path generation method, experiments on discretized blades are carried out, whose {{results show that the}} generated tool paths are both uniform and boundary-conformed...|$|E

To meet the <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> of large axisymmetry aspheric lens, the grating parallel grinding method is adopted. Considering high precision surface grinder {{structure and the}} main error factors affect the machining accuracy of large aspheric, a large axisymmetric aspheric error model is proposed, {{which can be used}} to predict surface accuracy and compensation grinding. The main error factors are discussed and it is shown that the straightness error, positioning error and arc radii error are main errors that effect surface error distribution, meanwhile, surface error value is the mixed result of each individual error. The experiments are carried out and in agreement with the theoretical results. The grinding experiment shows that the model can well predict surface accuracy and surface accuracy is improved after compensation grinding. ? 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} much that we have learned about {{materials}} processing in the ultrashort-pulse regime, there is an enormous amount that we don`t know. How short does the pulse have to be to achieve a particular cut (depth, material, quality) ? How deep can you cut? What is the surface roughness? These questions are clearly dependent upon the properties of the material of interest along with the short-pulse interaction physics.

The structure of 3 -axis rotation CNC clamp and the control software are designed and achieved. The parallel grinding method of off-axis wedge aspheric lens is realized in the CNC plane grinding machine by using the proposed clamp.

40|$|Nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{are widely}} employed in modern aircraft engines {{because of their}} excellent material characteristics, particularly in the fabrication of film cooling holes. However, the high <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> {{of a large number}} of film cooling holes can be extremely challenging. The hybrid machining technique of tube electrode high-speed electrochemical discharge drilling (TEHECDD) has been considered as a promising method for the production of film cooling holes. Compared with any single machining process, this hybrid technique requires the removal of more complex machining by-products, including debris produced in the electrical discharge machining process and hydroxide and bubbles generated in the electrochemical machining process. These by-products significantly affect the machining efficiency and surface quality of the machined products. In this study, tube electrodes in different inner diameters are designed and fabricated, and the effects of inner diameter on the machining efficiency and surface quality of TEHECDD are investigated. The results show that larger inner diameters could effectively improve the flushing condition and facilitate the removal of machining by-products. Therefore, higher material removal efficiency, surface quality, and electrode wear rate could be achieved by increasing the inner diameter of the tube electrode...|$|E
40|$|This Issue Brief {{examines}} {{recent cases}} addressing the patent eligibility of computer-implemented method claims and their {{implications for the}} development of cloud computing technologies. Despite the Supreme Court’s refusal to endorse the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive patent eligibility inquiry, lower courts have continued to invalidate method claims using a stringent “particular machine” requirement alongside the requisite abstract ideas analysis. This Issue Brief argues that 1) post-Bilski v. Kappos cases have failed to elucidate what constitutes a particular machine for computer-implemented methods; 2) in light of substantial variance among Federal Circuit judges’ Section 101 jurisprudence, the application of the particular <b>machine</b> <b>requirement</b> has become subject to a high degree of panel-dependency, such that its relevance for analyzing software method claims has come under question; 3) notwithstanding the unease expressed by practitioners and scholars for the future of cloud computing patents, the courts’ hardening stance toward computer-implemented method claims will do little to deter patenting in the cloud computing context.

40|$|The {{machining}} precision {{plays an}} important role in the operation reliability and service life of screw rotors. However, the actual machined rotor profile of screw rotors is different from its theoretical profile due to the errors of the machine tool. This paper proposes a novel method of error tracing and compensation to reduce the machined errors of rotor profile on the basis of the limited sample trials, and the method is based on a matrix of error compensation. The errors of rotor profile are obtained based on limited sample trials machining of screw rotors,and fitted into piecewise smooth data. A matrix of error compensation is established to compute the errors of rotor profile to generate a compensated rotor profile. The compensated rotor profile is then used to regenerate forming tool and a new rotor product is processed on the same machine tool. And the errors of new rotor profile are smaller and can be reduced within (− 0. 01 [*]mm, 0. 01 [*]mm) after compensations. Finally, the actual machining examples illustrate that the method of error compensation can not only satisfy the <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> of high-precision rotors, but also has the characteristics of good stability and applicability...|$|E
40|$|An {{enormous}} amount of heat is released at the contact surface during machining of a component/partdue to friction, rubbing action and cutting forces generated. Cutting fluids are generally applied to provide lubrication and cooling at the tool and workpiece interface. They also play a beneficial role in machining operations, and enhance job shop’s productivity, tool life {{and quality of the}} finished parts/products. In addition to these, they act as an important contributor in optimizing a machining operation. However, a cutting fluid suitable for a particular <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> may not be equally good for other applications and hence, {{there is a need for}} selection of the appropriate type of cutting fluid with a view to facilitate superlative and uncomplicated machining operation. Several factors, such as material ofthe cutting tool, operator’s safety, compatibility with the machine tool, reliability and rancidity of the cutting fluid, and cost may all combine to limit the effectiveness or applicability of a cutting fluid. Therefore, the present study explores the potentiality of a modified similarity-based method, which is a multi-criteria decision making tool, in solving cutting fluid selection problems. To illustrate the procedural steps of this method, two real time problems are solved. The results obtained highly corroborate with the opinions of the experts in the related field, demonstrating the applicability of the said method...|$|E
40|$|Carbide end mill, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used cutting tool in aluminum, titanium and steel machining industry, is of crucial importance in the industry regarding to the machining efficiency and quality. For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on grinding tool path. In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface. First, the end and side clearance surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the <b>machining</b> <b>requirement</b> of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface face; Then, the surface of the fillet flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner. And a rake angle based method is applied for modeling of the fillet rake surface. A detailed discussion on parametric variables of this method is provided for a more accurate surface. Together with flutes and gashes, the solid model of the fillet end-mill can be modeled using Boolean operations. All the modeling process is carried out with a VB automatic program for fast and customized modeling in CATIA. In order to examine the geometry of this model, machining simulation is conducted in a finite element analysis software compared with the original model which based on grinding tool path...|$|E
