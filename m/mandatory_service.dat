25|$|The Second Estate (the nobility) {{consisted}} of approximately 1.5% of France's population, and was exempt from almost all taxes, including the Corvée Royale, {{which was a}} recent <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> in which the roads would be repaired and built by those subject to the corvée. In practice, anyone who paid a small fee could escape the corvee, so this burden of labor fell only to the poorest in France. The Second Estate was also exempt from the Gabelle, which was the unpopular tax on salt, and also the Taille, the oldest form of taxation in France.|$|E

Each year, 1,500 female combat soldiers are drafted into the IDF. Women currently make up 3% of the IDF's combat soldiers. Women were employed in full combat roles during the War of Independence and early years. An incident involving the abuse of a woman's corpse led to their withdrawal from full combat until 2000, when the Caracal Battalion was raised.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{mission of the}} armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad. Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with NATO and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military. The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed. Compulsory military service for men was discontinued in 2008. From 2007, until conscription ended in 2008, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> was nine months.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall in 1961, military service in the GDR was voluntary, though the Free German Youth and public schools mounted intensive recruitment drives and service in the NVA was often a prerequisite for career advancement. Compulsory service had been introduced earlier in West Germany (1956) – one year after the Federal Armed Forces were established – but the GDR held back from this step until 1962. The situation changed when the border was sealed in August 1961, and five months later the government announced a <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> term of 18 months for men.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergency}} physician, in German , {{must be a}} Physician with a Notfallmedizin (Emergency Medicine) board certification, {{issued by}} the State Chamber of Physicians. In order to obtain the board certification, a minimum term of residency in a specialty related to critical care medicine, additional training in techniques of anaesthetics and critical care medicine and the passing of a board examination is required. While the position is technically open to any physician who completes the board certification process, due to the inderdisciplinary nature of medical emergencies, most of the physicians employed as Notarzt are anaesthesiologists. The latter have <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> as a Notarzt during their specialty training.|$|E

To join the officer corps, a 3-day selection process must be successfully completed at the officer candidates selection centre in Köln-Porz at the Mudra barracks.

Upon turning eighteen, in May 1910, he was deemed unfit to serve in the Serbian Army and excused from <b>mandatory</b> <b>service.</b> After graduation, in the autumn of 1910, he enrolled in the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, where he studied the works of Immanuel Kant, as well as German, Italian and South Slavic literature with varying rates of success. Shortly after entering the university, Bojić began contributing theatrical reviews to Pijemont, an ultra-nationalist daily strongly opposed to the Prime Minister of Serbia, Nikola Pašić, and his People's Radical Party (...)

500|$|To a {{great extent}} Chamberlain's actual {{responsibilities}} were left vague by Lloyd George. On his appointment Lloyd George implied in the House of Commons that [...] "compulsion" [...] (the industrial equivalent of conscription) was to be extended to industry and that Chamberlain would soon produce a system of industrial enrolment. But Chamberlain found his work to be handicapped by the Prime Minister's political manoeuvres. As Chamberlain sought to maximise {{the number of workers}} subject to both conscription and compulsion, Lloyd George pledged to the unions that he would oppose any sort of [...] "industrial conscription". Although Chamberlain repeatedly made proposals for <b>mandatory</b> <b>service,</b> they were turned down by Lloyd George and his War Cabinet. The Army still controlled its own recruitment at this stage, whilst Chamberlain met with resistance from the Ministries of Munitions and Labour. Chamberlain’s proposal that all men under 21 be drafted from industry into the Army was blocked by Minister of Munitions Addison (19 January 1917), as it would have meant conscripting skilled young men who had already spent time in apprenticeships.|$|E

As of 2007, an estimated minority of 16,000 to 19,000 11th grade pupils annually engage in squad-sized operations, night treks and shooting, with the promise of rewards for excellence when the youth join the Israel Defense Forces.
