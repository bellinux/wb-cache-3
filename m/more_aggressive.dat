5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years.

The convict cichlids are <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{relational}} aggression has been type-cast {{as a female}} form of aggression and the literature {{has focused on the}} “gender dichotomy” in our understanding of aggressive behaviors. Girls have been characterized as <b>more</b> relational <b>aggressive</b> (e. g., threatening to withdraw from a relationship and manipulating relationships to damage others) than boys; and boys have been characterized as <b>more</b> physically <b>aggressive</b> than girls. However, other researchers have found no or weak gender differences in {{relational aggression}}. Our understanding of gender differences in aggressive behavior and how this affects the developmental progression of bullying and relational aggression among school-aged youth is murky, at best...|$|R

5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> warlike cult.

5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} social impact of ADHD, {{with and without}} opposition-defiant {{behaviour}} (ADHD+ODD (n= 22) and ADHD-only (n= 18)), in 9 - to 12 - year old girls compared to girls without ADHD (n= 40). Girls played a computer game involving simulated players, and mothers and teachers completed rating scales. In general, mothers and teachers saw girls with ADHD+ODD as more overtly and relationally aggressive and less prosocial than girls with ADHD-only, who were seen as more overtly and relationally aggressive and less prosocial than control girls. On the computer game, girls with ADHD+ODD were <b>more</b> overtly <b>aggressive,</b> <b>more</b> directly relationally <b>aggressive,</b> and showed less skilled behaviour than the other groups. Girls with ADHD-only showed less covert, indirect relational aggression and more socially awkward interactions than girls {{in the control group}} on the computer game. In all, the results indicate that girls with ADHD, with and without ODD behaviour, engage in socially detrimental behaviours...|$|R

50|$|Crick's work on {{childhood}} aggression demonstrated that, as a group, {{boys are}} <b>more</b> physically <b>aggressive</b> than girls. Her study hypothesized that this finding reflects {{a lack of}} research on forms of aggression {{that are relevant to}} girls rather than an actual gender difference in levels of overall aggressiveness.The form of aggression hypothesized to be typical of girls, relational aggression, was assessed with a peer nomination instrument in third- through sixth-grade children. Results provided evidence for the validity and distinctiveness of the construct of relational aggression, defined as acts intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships. In addition to finding that girls tended to be <b>more</b> relationally <b>aggressive</b> than boys, she found evidence that relationally aggressive children were at risk for serious adjustment difficulties.|$|R
