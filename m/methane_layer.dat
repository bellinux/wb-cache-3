Changing atmospheric and oceanic temperatures may impact the presence and depth of the hydrate stability zone; however to what extent is still uncertain. In oceanic sediments, increasing pressure due to a rise in sea level may offset some of the impact of increasing temperature upon the hydrate stability equilibrium.1 ...|$|E

We have used grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation for the modeling of the hydrogen and methane mixture storage at 293 K and pressure of methane and hydrogen mixture up to 2 MPa. We have found that these pores serve as efficient vessels for the storage of hythane fuel near ambient temperatures and low pressures. We find that, for carbons having optimized slitlike pores of size H ≅ 7 Å (pore width that can accommodate one adsorbed <b>methane</b> <b>layer),</b> and bulk hydrogen mole fraction ≥ 0. 9, the volumetric stored energy exceeds the 2010 target of 5. 4 MJ dm- 3 established by the U.

We proposed the simple system with added extra container filled with pure free/adsorbed methane for adjusting the composition of the desorbed mixture as needed during delivery. Our simulation results indicate that light slit pore carbon nanomaterials with optimized parameters are suitable filling vessels for storage of hythane fuel.

40|$|Optimizing Coal Bed Methane (CBM) {{production}} {{depends on}} the trapping mechanism of methane in the micro pores of coal bed. Methane is trapped in coal beds by adsorption on the free surface. The free surface is mainly available as the micro pores and partly as different cleats. The average percentage of micro pores (1. 2 x 10 - 7 cm diameter) in a coal increases with rank and ranges from 19. 3 % in lignites to 75 % in anthracites. The effective molecular diameter of adsorbed methane is 4. 1 x 10 - 8 cm suggesting a maximum of three molecules can be accommodated in a unit micro pore. The commitment of optimized production of methane {{depends on the}} amount adsorbed on the coal surface. Methane in the micro pore can be accommodated either by solution in pore water or adsorption or as free gas under pressure. If it is dissolved in water, then for CBM production it is not useful because the dissolved gas will be expelled during dewatering phase of the well completion. It is only the free gas and the adsorbed gas {{that need to be}} evaluated for optimized production. Langmuir assumed a mono-layer of adsorption in selective locales on the adsorbent whereas many of the present day models assumed multi-layers of adsorbates (BET: Stephen Brunauer, Paul Emmett and Edward Teller). Problem arises with the concept of layering during adsorption process whereby it is difficult to think of adsorption of methane over a <b>methane</b> <b>layer.</b> With higher pressure methane can be accommodated as free gas but will not be adsorbed on any methane surface.

30|$|There {{are many}} studies of adsorbed gas. Most of those studies neglect the {{difference}} between dissolved gas and adsorbed gas and consider both types of gas as adsorbed gas. To make it more accurate, we use sorption referring to the combination of adsorption and dissolution. When we use the Langmuir sorption model, both the adsorbed gas and dissolved gas are considered and they cannot be distinguished in this model. Ambrose et al. (2010) proposed a new model to calculate the gas in place by considering the sorption effect. They believed that the free gas volume needs to be corrected by subtracting the adsorbed layer volume. The sorbed <b>methane</b> <b>layer</b> density was suggested to be 0.34  g/cm 3 by molecular dynamic modeling. Pang et al. (2016) experimentally measured the sorption in five shale samples and successfully matched the data using the Dubinin–Astakhov model. The sorption effect on porosity and permeability was carefully studied in their work. Yu et al. (2014) compared the Langmuir and BET models and believed that the increment of sorption at high pressures was caused by multilayer sorption. The BET model was more suitable in their work. A simplified local density model was also successfully used to model the shale adsorption (Chareonsuppanimit et al. 2012; Ma and Jamili 2016). Mostly the sorbed layer is considered immovable and static, {{but this is not}} correct. Recently, some scholars modeled the surface diffusion of adsorbed gas and investigated the effect of the adsorbed layer on shale gas flow using analytic models (Wu et al. 2015, 2016 a). Molecular dynamic simulation studies have also proven that the adsorbed layer could either enhance or reduce the flow rate in shale reservoirs depending on variations in adsorption under different conditions (Riewchotisakul and Akkutlu 2015; Wang et al. 2016 b, c; Wu and Zhang 2016). To our knowledge, the enhancement or reduction of permeability depends on {{the difference between}} the surface diffusion capacity of adsorbed gas and the flow capacity of free gas with the corresponding volume fractions.|$|E

The emission {{is dominated by the}} H 2 Lyman and Werner bands extending from the extreme ultraviolet to about 170 nm. The wavelengths below about 135 nm are partly absorbed by the <b>methane</b> <b>layer</b> overlying the auroral emission layer. The long wavelength intensity is proportional to the precipitated energy flux carried by the auroral electrons. Spectral observations with the Hubble Space Telescope were made in 2014 using the long slit of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in the timetag mode. During these observations, the slit projection scanned the polar region down to mid-latitudes. The combination of spectral and temporal measurements was used to build up the first spectral maps of the FUV Jovian aurora. The two-dimensional distribution of the intensity ratio of the two spectral regions has been obtained by combining spectral emissions in these wavelength ranges. They show that the amount of absorption by methane varies significantly between the different components of the aurora and in the polar region. Outputs from an electron transport model are used to create maps of the distribution of the characteristic electron energies. Using model atmospheres adapted to auroral conditions, we conclude that electron energies generally range between a few tens to several hundred keV. In this presentation, we analyze the relationship between the precipitated electron energy flux and the mean electron energy derived from these observations. Although globally, no correlation can be found, we show that the two quantities co-vary in some auroral components such as in the morning sector or in the striations observed along the main emission. By contrast, the auroral input in some high-latitude regions show no correlation with the electron characteristic energy. These aspects will be quantitatively discussed and possible processes explaining this dichotomy will be proposed. Comparisons of derived energies are in general agreement with those calculated from magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling models, but they locally exceed current model predictions.

A simple transport-reaction model was developed to reproduce the Cl- observations and quantify processes such as hydrate formation, methane demand, and fluid flow. From this first field observation of a positive Cl- anomaly, high hydrate formation rates (0. 15 – 1. 08 mol cm- 2 a- 1) were calculated. Our model results also suggest that the fluid flow rate at the Cascadia accretionary margin is constrained to 45 – 300 cm a- 1.

Paradoxically, many of these extreme greenhouse episodes are preceded or followed by cold climate, perhaps even glacial conditions, as inferred from the occurrence of glendonites in high latitudes. Glendonites are pseudomorphs of ikaite (CaCO 3 · 6 H 2 O), a hydrated carbonate mineral increasingly stable at low temperatures. Here, we show that methane seepage and oxidation provide an overriding control on Mesozoic glendonite formation (i. e., ikaite fossilization). Geochemical and petrological analyses of 33 Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous glendonites from five sections in Siberia (Russia) reveal that most of their infilling carbonate phases are reminiscent of methane-derived authigenic carbonates. Bulk glendonites and surrounding sediments exhibit exceptionally high and low carbon isotope values (+ 20 ‰ to – 45 ‰ VPDB [Vienna Peedee belemnite]), typical for carbon sources linked to methane generation and oxidation.

Model calculations of heavy ion precipitation and corresponding estimates of the associated sulfur and oxygen UV emissions previously carried out suggest emission values for 1304 A OI emission that are at least 30 times larger than the upper limit values set by the IUE observations reported. On the other hand the observed (feature of SII at 1256 A of 2 kR) is quite comparable to the theoretically predicted emission intensity. Taken together these observations and calculations suggest that electron as well as ion precipitation play a role in Jovian auroral processes.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we present}} the {{development}} of a novel, compact and highly sensitive waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer to measure methane dissolved in water. Methane is a greenhouse gas, like carbon dioxide, and is emitted from both natural sources and human activities. Due to the challenges to measure dissolved methane in the sea and the vast area it covers, much of the methane cycle is unknown. In the last couple of years, there has been an up-swing in {{the development of}} subsea methane sensors. These high-end sensors rely on successfully separating the dissolved gas from the water with a membrane before the measurements, effecting the limit of detection, response time and it may give rise to hysteresis effects. Alternatively, samples can be transported to an on-shore laboratory, which can be time-consuming and expensive. We developed a methane sensor with the possibilities of direct and in-situ detection of methane with a relatively cheap and compact optical sensor-chip. A <b>methane</b> sensitive <b>layer,</b> consisting of a host-polymer and cryptophane-A, is deposited onto the chip. Cryptophane-A is a supra-molecular compound that can entrap methane molecules within its structure and thus, induce a change in the refractive index of the host-polymer. This change is detected by the evanescent field from the waveguide, in the sensing arm of the interferometer. Thus, with a change in refractive index in the sensitive layer, a phase change between the reference and the sensing arms of the interferometer is obtained. For obtaining optimal design, simulations were made for shallow silicon nitride rib waveguides with respect to the sensitivity as function of refractive index and the mode-behaviour of the waveguide. Once the design had been established, the waveguides were fabricated externally, with a core thickness of 150 nm, a rib height of 5 nm, rib widths of 1. 5, 2 and 3 μm and sensing lengths of 1, 2 and 3 cm. The propagation losses were measured and simulated for tantalum pentoxide (similar to silicon nitride) strip and rib waveguides, to find the dependence of the propagation losses on the waveguide width. The sensitivity of the sensor was characterised with a diluted acid (HCl) and, in a separate measurement, by changing the temperature of the sensor coated with a polymer (PDMS). The sensor was combined with a <b>methane</b> sensitive <b>layer</b> of styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and cryptophane-A, to detect methane gas. The sensitive layer showed a 17 -folded sensitivity increase with a cryptophane-A to SAN ratio of 1 : 9. Methane gas was measured in the range of 300 ppm to 4. 4 %(v/v), with a detection limit of 17 ppm. Finally, the sensor was tested with methane in water. It was found that when the sensitive layer was exposed to water, the SAN polymer showed fractures along the surface. In an effort to circumvent the problem, a protecting layer of PDMS was deposited directly onto the SAN layer. However, after some time bubble structures appeared within the layer after exposure to water. Despite this, dissolved methane was successfully and repeatedly detected for concentration in range 9 to 46 μM. A detection limit of 49 nM was obtained, showing that the sensor is suitable for measurements of methane dissolved in water...|$|R

In a high vacuum chamber <b>methane</b> ice <b>layers</b> covered by water layers were grown by vapor deposition at 30 K. Then, the two-layered system was warmed to the temperature of interest and kept at that temperature while the diffusion of CH 4 molecules was monitored by means of FTIR spectroscopy. The decay of intensity with time of the strong IR absorption associated to the ¿ 3 mode of methane (see Figure 1) {{is a measure of the}} number of methane molecules that have moved through the pores of the ASW layer and left the sample. Diffusion coefficients were extracted from the isothermal experiments using Fick¿s second law of diffusion [1, 2]. The effect on the results of ASW compactation upon annealing will be discussed.

40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} {{are expected}} to be a potential energy resource with extensive distribution in the permafrost and in deep ocean sediments. The marine gas hydrate drilling explorations at the Eastern Nankai Trough of Japan revealed the variable distribution of hydrate deposits. Gas hydrate reservoirs are composed of alternating beds of sand and clay, with various conditions of permeability, porosity, and hydrate saturation. This study looks into the multiphase flow behaviors of <b>layered</b> <b>methane</b> hydrate reservoirs induced by gas production. Firstly, a history matching model by incorporating the available geological data at the test site of the Eastern Nankai Trough, which considers the layered heterogeneous structure of hydrate saturation, permeability, and porosity simultaneously, was constructed to investigate the production characteristics from layered hydrate reservoirs. Based on the validated model, the effects of the placement of production interval on production performance were investigated. The modeling results indicate that the dissociation zone is strongly affected by the vertical reservoir’s heterogeneous structure and shows a unique dissociation front. The beneficial production interval scheme should consider the reservoir conditions with high permeability and high hydrate saturation. Consequently, the identification of the favorable hydrate deposits is significantly important to realize commercial production in the future...|$|R

In this work, the use of a non-stoichiometric perovskite, La 0. 8 Ce 0. 1 Ni 0. 4 Ti 0. 6 O 3, as a reforming layer in reducing atmospheres led to the surface being highly populated with homogeneously exsolved Ni nano particles. This catalyst layer was applied to Ni-GDC anode supported and ScSZ electrolyte supported cells to prevent carbon deposition and to stabilize operation with dry <b>methane.</b> The catalyst <b>layer</b> showed both excellent attachment to the Ni-GDC anode and resistance to carbon deposition. The performance of the Ni-GDC anode-supported cells with the catalyst layer was about 1. 1 W/cm 2 in hydrogen fuel which is similar to that seen without the use of a catalyst layer. For the ScSZ electrolyte supported cells, the catalyst layer improved the power density and stability when in operation with dry methane. Publisher PD...|$|R
40|$|Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, an fjord on the {{southeast}} coast of Vancouver Island, typically stratifies in summer, {{leading to the}} formation of an oxic-anoxic interface in the water column and accumulation of methane in the deep water. The results of methane concentration measurements in the water column of the inlet at various times throughout the summer months in 1983 are presented. Methane gradients and calculated diffusive fluxes across the oxic-anoxic interface increased as the summer progressed. Methane distribution and consumption in Saanich Inlet were studied in more detail during August 1986. At this time, a typical summer stratification with an oxic-anoxic interface around 140 m was present. At the interface, steep gradients in nutrient concentrations, bacterial abundance and methane concentration were observed. Methane oxidation was detected in the aerobic surface waters and in the anaerobic deep layer, but highest rates occurred in a narrow layer at the oxic-anoxic interface. Estimated methane oxidation rates were suffcient to consume 100 percent of the methane provided by diffusive flux from the anoxic <b>layer.</b> <b>Methane</b> oxidation is thus a mechanism whereby atmospheric flux from anoxic waters is minimized...|$|R

Res. 92, 14987 - 15001) {{presented}} {{a range of}} temperature and CH 4 profiles for Uranus that were consistent with 1986 Voyager radio occultation measurements. A localized refractivity slope variation near 1. 2 bars was interpreted {{to be the result}} of a condensed CH 4 cloud layer. However, models fit to near-IR spectra found particle concentrations in the 1. 5 - 3 bar range (Sromovsky et al. 2006, Icarus 182, 577 - 593, Sromovsky and Fry 2008, Icarus 193, 211 - 229, Irwin et al. 2010, Icarus 208, 913 - 926), and a recent analysis of STIS spectra argued that aerosol particles formed diffusely distributed hazes, with no compact condensation layer (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2009, Icarus 202, 287 - 309). Trying to reconcile these results, we reanalyzed the occultation observations with a He volume mixing ratio reduced from 0. 15 to 0. 116, which is near the edge of the 0. 033 range given by Conrath et al. (1987, J. Geophys. Res., 15003 - 10). This allowed us to obtain saturated CH 4 mixing ratios within the putative cloud layer and to reach above-cloud and deep CH 4 mixing ratios compatible with STIS spectral constraints. Using a 5 -layer vertical aerosol model with two compact cloud layers in the 1 - 3 bar region, we find that the best fit pressure for the upper layer is virtually identical to the pressure range inferred from the occultation analysis for a methane mixing ratio near 4 % at 5 deg S, arguing that Uranus does indeed have a compact <b>methane</b> cloud <b>layer.</b> While our cloud model can fit the latitudinal variations in spectra between 30 deg S and 20 deg N using the same temperature and CH 4 profiles, closer to the pole, the model requires the introduction of an increasingly strong upper tropospheric depletion of CH 4 at increased latitudes, in rough agreement with the trend identified by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2009, Icarus 202, 287 - 309).

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{diversification of}} animal groups {{known as the}} Cambrian Explosion (evolution's 'Big Bang') remains an unsolved puzzle in Earth Science. The Vendian–Cambrian interval is characterized by anomalously high rates of apparent plate motion, interpreted as True Polar Wander (TPW), and {{by more than a}} dozen large, high-frequency perturbations in carbon isotopes that dwarf all others observed through the past 65 million years. We suggest that these biological, tectonic, and geochemical events are intimately related in the following fashion. First, tropical continental margins and shelf-slopes which formed during fragmentation of the supercontinent Rodinia accumulated massive quantities of isotopically-light organic carbon during Late Neoproterozoic time, as indicated by strikingly heavy isotope ratios in inorganic carbon during interglacial intervals. Second, an initial phase of Vendian TPW moved these organic-rich deposits to high latitude, where conditions favored trapping biogenic <b>methane</b> in <b>layers</b> of gas hydrate and perhaps permafrost. Continued sedimentation during Late Vendian time added additional hydrate/gas storage volume and stabilized underlying units until the geothermal gradient moved them out of the clathrate stability field, building up deep reservoirs of highly pressurized methane. Finally, a burst of TPW brought these deposits back to the Tropics, where they gradually warmed and were subjected to regional-scale thermohaline eddy variation and related sedimentation regime changes. Responding to the stochastic character of such changes, each reservoir reached a critical failure point independently at times throughout the Cambrian. By analogy with the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum event, these methane deposits yield transient, greenhouse-induced pulses of global warming when they erupt. Temperature correlates powerfully with biodiversity; the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at higher temperature decrease generation time and maintain relatively rich and dense invertebrate populations. Repeated thermal pulses along with progressive disruption and alteration of global ocean circulation patterns by TPW could cause the increase in diversity that accompanied the radiation of metazoans. We suggest that a methane 'fuse' ignited the Cambrian Evolutionary Explosion...|$|R
40|$|Sea floor methane vents and seeps direct methane {{generated}} by microbial and thermal decompositions {{of organic matter}} in sediment into the oceans and atmosphere. Methane vents contribute to ocean acidification, global warming, and providing a long-term (e. g. 500 – 4000 years; Powell et al., 1998) life-sustaining role for unique chemosynthetic biological communities. However, the role methane vents play in both climate change and chemosynthetic life remains controversial primarily {{because we do not}} understand long-term methane flux and the mechanisms that control it ([Milkov et al., 2004], [Shakhova et al., 2010] and [Van Dover, 2000]). Vents are inherently dynamic and flux varies greatly in magnitude and even flow direction over short time periods (hours-to-days), often tidally-driven ([Boles et al., 2001] and [Tryon et al., 1999]). But, it remains unclear if flux changes at vents occur on the order of the life-cycle of various species within chemosynthetic communities (months, years, to decades [Leifer et al., 2004] and [Torres et al., 2001]) and thus impacts their sustainability. Here, using repeat high-resolution 3 D seismic surveys acquired in 2000 and 2008, we demonstrate in 4 D that Hydrate Ridge, a vent off the Oregon coast has undergone significant reduction of methane flow and complete interruption in just the past few years. In the subsurface, below a frozen <b>methane</b> hydrate <b>layer,</b> free gas appears to be migrating toward the vent, but currently there is accumulating gas that is unable to reach the seafloor through the gas hydrate layer. At the same time, abundant authigenic carbonates show that the system has been active for several thousands of years. Thus, it is likely that activity has been intermittent because gas hydrates clog the vertical flow pathways feeding the seafloor vent. Back pressure building in the subsurface will ultimately trigger hydrofracturing that will revive fluid-flow to the seafloor. The nature of this mechanism implies regular recurring flow interruptions and methane flux changes that threaten the viability of chemosynthetic life, but simultaneously and enigmatically sustains it...|$|R
