5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, the <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients being treated in hospice facilities {{on any given day}} was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{growth of}} the recently discovered respiratory pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae in McCoy, HeLa 229, BHK- 21, and HL cells. When cells were not pretreated with DEAE-dextran, HL cells had significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> inclusion-forming units (IFUs) on initial inoculation than the other cell lines. When cells were pretreated with DEAE-dextran, HeLa 229 and HL cells had equivalent <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> IFUs on initial inoculation. HL cells had strikingly higher <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> IFUs in passage than HeLa 229, BHK- 21, or McCoy cells. In addition, HL cells did not require pretreatment with DEAE-dextran and could be used from 2 to 4 days after seeding.

25|$|Because {{citation}} counts have highly skewed distributions, the <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> citations {{is potentially}} misleading if used {{to gauge the}} typical impact of articles in the journal rather than the overall impact of the journal itself.

40|$|The {{population}} structure of #Onchocerca volvulus$ macrofilariae was studied in villages of central Cameroon where onchocerciasis is hyper-endemic. One nodule selected at random {{was removed from}} each of 576 adult males, and examined by histology. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> male and female worms/nodule, {{and the status of}} the female worms (fecund, non-fecund, or dead) were recorded. The observations were analysed to evaluate whether the <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> worms of each category varied in relation to the patient's age, the level of endemicity in his village, the anatomical localization of the nodule, the weight of the nodule, and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> palpable nodules harboured by the patient. The results obtained were very similar to those reported from West Africa. The <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> dead female worms/nodule were relatively high in the villages with the lowest levels <b>of</b> endemicity.
