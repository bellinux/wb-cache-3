40|$|As a young boy, I became {{mesmerized by}} medieval European castles, fabulous armor suites, ancient arms, noble knights, {{powerful}} lords, glamorous ladies and wealthy kings that I {{read about in}} numerous literary works. An example of these elemems can be found throughout the story of King Arthur, which has been retold in numerous books and movies. As a man <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in the subject has not subsided. My focus has now shifted from fairy tales to actual historic record. As an undergraduate student I took many courses that further developed <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in the subject.

I hope this Handbook may help deepen the interest of other scientists in this subject” O. Hutzinger, Amsterdam, May 1980.|$|R
50|$|Since my {{projects}} {{depend on}} <b>my</b> <b>interests</b> and desires, and since <b>my</b> <b>interests</b> and desires don't seem to generate agent-neutral reasons, then the reasons in question must be agent-relative. Having established {{that there are}} genuine agent-relative reasons, Nagel concludes that it must sometimes be possible to pursue our own interests instead of the overall good, since agent-relative reasons will sometimes outweigh agent-neutral reasons. This appears both {{to account for the}} fact that there are moral requirements and the fact that we are sometimes allowed to promote our own projects.|$|R
