40|$|The {{accomplished}} investigations {{about the}} drying process of refractory concrete {{are of interest}} for the refractory industry, whose world-wide sold products are mainly used in the steel industry. In the recent years {{a considerable amount of}} refractory companies replaced their products with new technology: <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractory</b> materials - castables. The success of these materials is due to their numerous advantages. They have better insulation, the lining can be cast in a shorter period of time and the linings can be easily fit to different slopes. However, castables have to be dried at the customer´s premises. This drying process should under economical and environmental considerations be done as quickly as possible and too high vapour pressure should not occur. In order to improve the existing drying rules, prior measurements were undergone both, in the laboratory and in-situ. These measurements are very time-consuming and expensive. Additionally to various results in the past, the present doctorate contains numerical simulations where the most important mechanisms within the drying process of microporous, moisture containing refractory concretes are described. Beside the mass and energy transfer, adequate empirical equations to simulate the drying process are summarized. The developed model is tested by two different ultra low cement castables used as working linings of steel ladles and as safety linings of tundishes. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by prior experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. February 2014. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Eshan V. Dave. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 95 pages. Northern Minnesota's iron mines are {{the starting point}} {{for the majority of the}} steel that gets produced in the United States. Their taconite processing plants use heat in furnaces to oxidize and indurate iron in the final stage of making a taconite pellet. Facilities can increase efficiencies when refractory service life is maintained. Efficiencies gained include: less fuel used, better quality control, better furnace control, and less mechanical component maintenance. Furnace refractory linings fail when the cracks that develop in them are uncontrolled or too large. These failures allow heat and gases retained by the lining to reach structural or mechanical components. Furnace control and efficiencies are also compromised when heat and gases are allowed to short circuit or escape the system. These failures are primarily the result of thermal of shock and expansion. It is common place to add stainless steel needle reinforcement to a <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractory</b> in an effort to counteract these effects. This study used several standard ASTM testing procedures to test 65 % alumina mullite based refractory samples with 304 and 406 grade stainless steel needles. Mechanical property data gathered was used to analyze performance. The study found that adding reinforcement does not increase initial Compression and Cold Modulus of Ruptures strengths, however, after prolonged heat and thermal shock exposure, needles help maintain integrity and mechanical properties of samples. The study also found that corrosion due to oxidation was a major contributing factor to the way needles performed; and concluded that a concentration of 3 % 406 "Alfa 1 " stainless steel reinforcing needles added to the working lining of a taconite furnace is recommended...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} the <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> as {{compared}} to their shaped counterparts have been increasing over the years due to their distinct advantages like comparable durability, low cost and relatively easy installation procedure. Several attempts are being made in the optimization of the properties of these products. Among <b>monolithics,</b> <b>refractory</b> castables are the major ones which have replaced significant fraction of shaped refractories in the furnace lining. Among the castables, high alumina based castables {{are the most important}} type. This work focuses on the study of the properties of the conventional high alumina based refractory castables, firstly due to the reduction in the percentage of cement by reactive alumina and secondly due to the replacement of cement by micro-silica in the composition. The reduction in the percentage of cement improved the thermo-mechanical property which was indicated by the HMOR values and the incorporation of the micro-silica in the composition resulted in the development of good mechanical strength to the castables and also improved their thermo-mechanical properties. The improvement in mechanical properties and HMOR values for microsilica castables was definitely due to mullite formation. However as the microsilica content was only 4 %, the fraction of mullite that formed on firing was also less. Therefore, though the enhancement was distinct but it was only by about 25 %...|$|R

40|$|MgO based {{refractory}} castables draw wide technological {{interest because}} they have the versatility and installation advantages of <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> with intrinsic MgO properties, such as high refractoriness and resistance to basic slag corrosion. Nevertheless, MgO easily reacts with water to produce Mg(OH) (2), which is followed by a large volumetric expansion, limiting its application in refractory castables. In order to develop solutions to minimize this effect, {{a better understanding of the}} main variables involved in this reaction is required. In this work, the influence of temperature, as well as the impact of the chemical equilibrium shifting (known as the common-ion effect), on MgO hydration was evaluated. Ionic conductivity measurements at different temperatures showed that the MgO hydration reaction is accelerated with increasing temperature. Additionally, different compounds were added to evaluate their influence on the reaction rate. Among them, CaCl(2) delayed the reaction, whereas KOH showed an opposite behavior. MgCl(2) and MgSO(4) presented similar results and two other distinct effects, reaction delay and acceleration, which depended on their concentration in the suspensions. The results were evaluated by considering the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the reaction, and the mechanical damages in the samples that was caused by the hydration reaction.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was to develop and {{validate}} new classes of cost-effective low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both melting and casting environments. Three approaches were employed with partial to full success to achieve this goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for sealing surface porosity in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; and (3) Develop new <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions. The results of the research work and the field tests performed utilizing these three approaches are listed below: (1) It was demonstrated that high-density IR heating could be a tool for altering and sealing the surface porosity of fused silica. However, the process was not very cost-effective. (2) A low-cost glaze composition having a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) similar to that of a DFS tube was identified and was successfully tested for its integrity and adherence to DFS. Although the glaze acted as a barrier between the molten aluminum and the DFS, persistent porosity and crazing within the glaze affected its performance during the reactivity tests, thus acting as an obstacle in scaling up production of this glaze. (3) Pyrotek's XL glaze showed great success in improving the life of the DFS tubes. Pyrotek has reported an increasing market demand for the XL-coated DFS tubes, which exhibit useful lifetimes three times better than those of uncoated tubes. (4) A computer model to optimize particle size distribution for reduced permeability was developed and successfully applied to casting formulations.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{impressive}} developments observed in the last 20 years, {{the improvement of the}} installation methods of <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> is certainly to be taken into account. However, this evolution, from vibratable castables to shotcrete and drycrete was not applied to materials based on magnesia, which are still mostly commercialized as ramming mixes, or as pouring castables with poor properties due to excessive water use. The major issues associated to this lack of technology is the scarcity of submicrometric powders compatible to magnesian systems, and the expansion followed by hydration of the magnesia, which is a disruptive reaction. By a thorough research on the literature, some potential additives were identified to be tested as anti-hydration additives. Hydration tests of powders in autoclave, complemented by pH and rheological measurements on magnesia pastes have identified five possible additives which can be used to inhibit the hydration: tartaric acid, citric acid, boric acid, magnesium fluoride and microsilica. Salts from the organic acids can also be successfully used. Of these, microsilica also presented the advantage of providing the submicrometric particles necessary to improve the flow of the castable, and to improve the bond of the castable. The three acids are very effective in inhibiting the formation of magnesium hydroxide, but affect negatively flow properties and mechanical resistance after cure. Microsilica prevented hydration cracks due to the reaction between the silicic acid generated under basic environment with the newly formed brucite, leading to the precipitation of a magnesium-silica-hydrated phase of poor crystallinity between the magnesia grains. This phase does not promote volumetric change, and also enable water release at a wider temperature range. Due to its nature close to serpentine minerals, it forms forsterite and enstatite at low temperatures, thus generating suitable strength between room temperature and at least 1400 °C. Magnesium fluoride changed the nature of this magnesium-silica-hydrated phase, by being incorporated to it and forming a phase more similar to the humite minerals. These minerals present higher MgO:SiO 2 molar ratio than serpentine, and their formation requires a lower content of microsilica for a same effect against hydration, which is beneficial for the overall properties of the castable. The properties of the castable, as well as the influence of a number of other variables (for instance, refractoriness under load, creep, cold crushing strength, cold modulus of rupture, bulk density and apparent porosity) were also studied and hereby reported. It is believed that this technology can be further developed for industrial use, provided that some issues regarding the properties at high temperatures are solved. Not only had the study and comprehension {{of the nature of the}} bond between microsilica and magnesia, and the role of magnesium fluoride been pioneered by this work, but also the methodology used to evaluate the hydration after the drying process of castings, which was close to real refractory components...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in casting steel. This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the steel foundries both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American steel foundries as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in steel foundry furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the steel foundry refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for steel foundries. Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the steel foundry industry, and a shift from pre-fired materials (shaped <b>refractories)</b> to <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace tap temperature would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the ladle transfer portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent review}} by the U. S. Advanced Ceramics Association, the Aluminum Association, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies (DOE/OIT) {{described}} the status of advanced ceramics for aluminum processing, including monolithics, composites, and coatings. The report observed that monolithic ceramics (particularly oxides) have attractive properties such as resistance to heat, corrosion, thermal shock, abrasion, and erosion [1]. However, even after the developments of the past 25 years, there are two key barriers to commercialization: reliability and cost-effectiveness. Industry research is therefore focused on eliminating these barriers. Ceramic coatings have likewise undergone significant development {{and a variety of}} processes have been demonstrated for applying coatings to substrates. Some processes, such as thermal barrier coatings for gas turbine engines, exhibit sufficient reliability and service life for routine commercial use. Worldwide, aluminum melting and molten metal handling consumes about 506, 000 tons of refractory materials annually. Refractory compositions for handling molten aluminum are generally based on dense fused cast silica or mullite. The microstructural texture is extremely important because an interlocking mass of coarser grains must be bonded together by smaller grains in order to achieve adequate strength. At the same time, well-distributed microscopic pores and cracks are needed to deflect cracks and prevent spalling and thermal shock damage [2]. The focus of this project was to develop and validate new classes of cost-effective, low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both smelting and casting environments. The primary goal was to develop improved coatings and functionally graded materials that will possess superior combinations of properties, including resistance to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting. When these materials are successfully deployed in aluminum smelting and casting operations, their superior performance and durability will give end users marked improvements in uptime, defect reduction, scrap/rework costs, and overall energy savings resulting from higher productivity and yield. The implementation of results of this program will result in energy savings of 30 trillion Btu/year by 2020. For this Industrial Materials for the Future (IMF) project, riser tube used in the low-pressure die (LPD) casting of aluminum was selected as the refractory component for improvement. In this LPD process, a pressurized system is used to transport aluminum metal through refractory tubes (riser tubes) into wheel molds. It is important for the tubes to remain airtight because otherwise, the pressurized system will fail. Generally, defects such as porosity in the tube or cracks generated by reaction of the tube material with molten aluminum lead to tube failure, making the tube incapable of maintaining the pressure difference required for normal casting operation. Therefore, the primary objective of the project was to develop a riser tube that is not only resistant to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting, but is also less permeable, so as to achieve longer service life. Currently, the dense-fused silica (DFS) riser tube supplied by Pyrotek lasts for only 7 days before undergoing failure. The following approach was employed to achieve the goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for sealing surface porosity in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; (3) Develop new <b>monolithic</b> <b>refractories</b> designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions; (4) Optimize refractory formulations to minimize wetting by molten aluminum, and characterize erosion, corrosion, and spallation rates under realistic service conditions; and (5) Scale up the processing methods to full-sized components and perform field testing in commercial aluminum casting shops...|$|R

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of <b>monolithic</b> and brick <b>refractories.</b> It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
