5000|$|An {{important}} act {{was passed}} in 1908 (Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908) limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman {{was not to be}} below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance {{in the event of an}} accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term [...] " [...] workman [...] " [...] in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or furnace man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A [...] must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office <b>of</b> <b>checkweigher</b> or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.|$|R

These methods {{can be used for}} any probability distributions. However, their efficiencies will depend on the nature <b>of</b> distributions. Three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> estimation, namely, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> moments, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> least squares, and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> percentile matching, are presented below. <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> least squares is used for estimating parameters by minimizing the squared distance between the observed data and their fitted values. <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> moments is possibly the oldest <b>method</b> <b>of</b> finding point estimators. The moment estimators are obtained by equating the first k sample moments to the corresponding k population moments and solving the system of resulting simultaneous parametric equations in terms of sample moments. Percentile matching <b>method</b> uses percentiles <b>of</b> different orders of available data towards estimation of parameters in a distribution. When sample data is discrete, finding the percentile involves smoothing of data.

5000|$|Since {{the act of}} 1887, {{there have}} {{followed}} five minor acts, based {{on the recommendation of}} the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (" [...] owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager [...] ") to make the removal <b>of</b> a particular <b>checkweigher</b> a condition <b>of</b> employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment <b>of</b> a <b>checkweigher.</b> The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties.
