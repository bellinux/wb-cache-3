By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work.|$|E

Chang's research on the book was credited with the finding of the diaries of John Rabe and Minnie Vautrin, both of whom played important roles in the Nanking Safety Zone, a designated area in Nanjing that protected Chinese civilians during the Nanking Massacre.|$|E

500|$|In 1867, Offenbach had his {{greatest}} success. The premiere of La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, a satire on militarism, took place {{two days after}} the opening of the Paris Exhibition, an even greater international draw than the 1855 exhibition which had helped him launch his composing career. The Parisian public and the foreign visitors flocked to the new operetta. The foreign royalty who saw the piece included the King of Prussia accompanied by his chief minister, Otto von Bismarck. Halévy, with his experience as a senior civil servant, saw <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>than</b> most the looming threat from Prussia; he wrote in his diary, [...] "Bismarck is helping to double our takings. This time it's war we're laughing at, and war is at our gates." [...] La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein was followed quickly by a series of successful pieces: Robinson Crusoé, Geneviève de Brabant (revised version; both 1867), Le château à Toto, Le pont des soupirs (revised version) and L'île de Tulipatan (all in 1868).|$|E

Ian Inglis writes that [...] "Its rolling melody and warm vocals give it the texture of a love song, which, of course, it is: a love song to the Beatles." [...] In his book subtitled The Essential Songs of the Beatles' Solo Careers, Andrew Grant Jackson concludes of [...] "Run of the Mill": [...] "Such personal musings would be irrelevant to anyone but the biggest Beatle fans if Harrison hadn't so artfully written the words to be open-ended and applicable to anyone … A touching work of maturity by a little brother who saw <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>than</b> the others, realizing that he loved them but {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

500|$|For Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, a {{librettist}} {{kept the}} first and the last stanza and paraphrased the two inner stanzas in four movements. The second movement, based on Luther's second stanza, is focused on Simeon's perspective as a means of how to anticipate one's own death. The third movement interweaves Luther's complete text with a free recitative. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the librettist had room to add his own text because Luther's hymn is rather short. The allusion to [...] "light for the heathen" [...] from the gospel and the hymn refers to [...] "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved" [...] (...) [...] Luther's third stanza forms the basis for the fourth and fifth movements. The fourth movement refers to Paul's teaching about the grace of God, ("Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God") (...) [...] It declares the Lutheran teaching of justification [...] "by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone" [...] even <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>than</b> Luther's song.|$|E
500|$|According to Canard, Husayn [...] "stands out <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>than</b> {{the supreme}} {{commander}} Mu'nis {{or any other}} military leaders" [...] of the period for his ability and valour, {{as well as for}} his restive and ambitious spirit. He was also singled out in being of Arab descent, an unusual case among the Caliphate's senior leaders of the period. Canard assesses him as unusually open-minded, and attuned to the ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time, as indicated by his contact with the Sufi mystic al-Hallaj, who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn. Indeed, according to Canard, Husayn's espousal of Shi'ism, and his participation in the abortive coup of 908, can best be seen in light of a desire—typical of Shi'a sympathisers—for a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an [...] "ideal Muslim government", something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of. Finally, although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty, it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory, for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas.|$|E
