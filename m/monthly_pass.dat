25|$|A <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> {{provides}} unlimited travel {{between any}} two zones for one passenger on {{every day of}} a respective month. Monthly passes {{can be used on}} any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail or online from Metra's website. <b>Monthly</b> <b>pass</b> holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses. A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. <b>Monthly</b> <b>pass</b> holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> by purchasing incremental tickets from conductors on the train. Incremental tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 cents for every additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase incremental tickets for <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> holders.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2007, {{with the}} start of the S89 bus service, a {{combined}} Hudson–Bergen Light Rail ("HBLR") <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> and monthly MetroCard became available at NJ Transit ticket vending machines at HBLR stations.|$|E
25|$|Commuters {{can also}} buy a peak or {{off-peak}} ten trip ride, a weekly unlimited or an unlimited <b>monthly</b> <b>pass.</b> Monthly passes are good on any train {{regardless of the}} time of day, within the fare zones specified on the pass.|$|E
5000|$|Prepaid fares include Compass Card Stored Value, DayPasses, and <b>Monthly</b> <b>Passes.</b> <b>Monthly</b> <b>Passes</b> and U-Pass BC passes qualify {{under federal}} tax {{regulations}} for the Transit Pass Tax Credit.http://www.translink.bc.ca/About_TransLink/News_Releases/news10310602.asp ...|$|R
5000|$|Common <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> {{for both}} LRT and buses: This {{is the first}} time commuters have <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> which can be used on both LRTs and buses, helping to enhance {{integration}} of the public transport system.|$|R
25|$|VTA accepts fare {{payment in}} cash, <b>monthly</b> <b>passes,</b> and Clipper card. However, day <b>passes</b> and <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> are only {{available}} on the Clipper card. Up to 3 kids under 5 with fare-paying rider can board for free.|$|R
25|$|The Maryland Transit Administration has {{a special}} program set up with 24 Baltimore area colleges and {{universities}} which allows college students who are enrolled in a minimum of 6 hours per week can receive a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> for $50.00.|$|E
25|$|As {{this route}} is {{contracted}} {{with a private}} company, fares are high. A <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> costs $232, while one-way cash fare is $12. Because of this, some Embrun residents instead take OC Transpo route #232, which has a stop at a park and ride lot 8km north of Embrun. This is considerably cheaper (Route #232 costs $119 for a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> and $4.65 for one-way), but less convenient, as OC Transpo does not service the community itself, meaning Embrun residents have to drive 8km {{to the park and}} ride lot to ride OC Transpo. Route 232 also has later scheduled times—the latest trip on the 232 arrives in Ottawa for 8:20am, and leaves Ottawa at 5:15pm, which is much more convenient for Embrun residents who work 9-5 workweeks.|$|E
25|$|The Rail Runner {{connects with}} Amtrak and Greyhound Lines at Downtown Albuquerque. NMDOT Park and Ride {{shuttles}} connect the Downtown Albuquerque station to Moriarty, the NM 599 station to Los Alamos and southern Santa Fe, and the South Capitol station in Santa Fe {{to the communities}} of Los Alamos, Española, and Las Vegas. Park and Ride passengers with a systemwide <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> can ride the Rail Runner for free.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of youth summer <b>passes,</b> all SamTrans <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> must be loaded onto a Clipper card. Youth, senior and disabled <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> may only be loaded onto a corresponding Clipper card obtained from SamTrans or another Bay Area transit agency.|$|R
50|$|SPAN {{does not}} offer <b>monthly</b> <b>passes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The railway {{project had}} failed, but a toll bridge in New Jersey {{requested}} a similar {{system so that}} it could quickly scan for cars that had purchased a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass.</b> Then the U.S. Post Office requested a system to track trucks entering and leaving their facilities. These applications required special retroreflector labels. Finally, Kal Kan asked the Sylvania team for a simpler (and cheaper) version which they could put on cases of pet food for inventory control.|$|E
25|$|Commuter {{railroad}} ticket {{vending machines}} (TVM) for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad offer {{the option to}} purchase combined tickets/passes and MetroCards. A $5.50 MetroCard is available with a round-trip ticket, and a $50 MetroCard is available with a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass.</b> In addition, the machines sell separate $25 MetroCards. TVMs at Jamaica Station and Penn Station sell AirTrain JFK monthly passes {{on the back of}} LIRR tickets. All cards sold from these machines are of thick paper stock, not the normal plastic.|$|E
25|$|Transportation in Chicago {{consists}} of a public transportation infrastructure allowing for intermodal connections to local, regional, national and international transportation services. Parking lots are available adjacent to most suburban Metra stations for passengers connecting with their train by car. Most parking lots are operated by the municipality they are located in. Fees and fines are also assessed by the local municipality; however, parking is usually free on weekends and most holidays. Mass transit CTA and suburban Pace buses connect with many Metra stations downtown and in the suburbs. <b>Monthly</b> <b>pass</b> holders are offered link-up options with these services. In addition, many intercity bus lines connect with passengers outside of Union Station.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monthly</b> <b>passes</b> are: Adult $85, and Senior/Youth $45.00.|$|R
25|$|The MTA {{has since}} {{installed}} new fareboxes {{on all of}} its buses that issue daily passes with magnetic strips; new ticket vending machines at Light Rail and Metro Subway stations issue identical passes including the weekly and <b>monthly</b> <b>passes.</b> Weekly and <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> are not sold on buses.|$|R
50|$|In May 2016, the City Council {{approved}} a four-year phased-in approach to increase bus fares. The <b>monthly</b> bus <b>passes</b> will increase by $4 beginning July 1, 2016 {{for the first}} year. Each year thereafter on July 1; the <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> will increase by $2 until July 1, 2019. The overall increase for adult, youth, senior and disabled <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> will have an accumulative increase of $10 by fiscal year 2020.|$|R
25|$|The CharlieCard {{can store}} value (keep a cash balance) {{and hold a}} {{combination}} of time-based passes which allow unlimited rides during a set period of time. Passengers use the plastic CharlieCard by tapping it against a target on a gate or a vehicle farebox. If left in a wallet, the card can usually be read when the wallet {{is placed on the}} reader. The gate or farebox then either automatically debits the cost of the passenger's ride, or verifies that the card has a valid transfer or that the card has a pass that is valid for travel at the given time and location. Transit riders can add value or a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online.|$|E
25|$|The {{cash fare}} for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults and}} $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend on boarding location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those who already have a ticket, or who have a daily, weekly, or <b>monthly</b> <b>pass,</b> can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for proof of payment from passengers.|$|E

500|$|As of October 1, 2013, {{the current}} {{standard}} fare on Metrorail is $2.25 and reduced fare is $1.10. A standard <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> costs $112.50 and $56.25 for reduced fare. The monthly Easy Cards {{are sold at}} over 50 sales outlets. Reduced fares are available only to Medicare recipients, people with disabilities, and Miami-Dade students in grades 1 through 12. No charge to kids below [...] tall when accompanied by fare-paying rider; limit 3. Ticket vending machines (TVMs) that sell Easy Cards and Easy Tickets are found in all rail stations. All Miami-Dade senior citizens aged 65 years and older and with Social Security benefits, and veterans residing in Miami-Dade and earning less than $22,000 annually ride free with the reduced fare monthly Easy Card. All of the stations except the five {{in the downtown area}} and Tri-Rail station have dedicated parking available. Parking costs $4.50 per day or $11.50 for a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass.</b>|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a <b>monthly</b> <b>pass</b> from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.|$|E

25|$|The Green Line is {{the most}} heavily {{traveled}} light rail line in the United States, {{with an average of}} 230,000 riders each weekday. Because of this heavy ridership, at selected stops on the Green Line the MBTA implemented a system known as Show-N-Go, which allows riders to flash their <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> and enter through the rear doors of a train, reducing congestion at the front door. This worked well when <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> were on paper tickets, as each month's pass differed visually from the previous month, but became an issue when the MBTA encouraged riders to store their <b>monthly</b> <b>passes</b> on their CharlieCards, as passes held this way cannot be verified visually.|$|R
