25|$|The type of soils that {{dominate}} the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with <b>mountain</b> <b>soil</b> undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and <b>Mountain</b> <b>soil</b> undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. <b>Mountain</b> <b>soil</b> undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other vinous spirits, {{nomenclature}} singani is {{made only}} from the alexandria varietal and is single batch, never blended. [...] Because of singani producers’ methods learned over centuries, the extreme climate at high altitude, the <b>mountain</b> <b>soil</b> and other factors of terroir, singani has a distinct flavor profile. [...] The profile is achieved without barrel aging, much like tequila. [...] The coded regulatory organoleptic properties of singani are, aspect: clear, clean, brilliant; [...] color: colorless; [...] aroma: terpenol profile of alexandria muscat predominates (primarily geraniol, linalool, and nerol); [...] taste (mouthfeel): fine, soft, smooth, with balanced structure.|$|E

50|$|In the Adirondack <b>Mountains,</b> <b>soils</b> on anorthositic rock {{tend to be}} stony {{loamy sand}} with classic podzol profile {{development}} usually evident. In the San Gabriel <b>Mountains,</b> <b>soils</b> on anorthosite have a dominance of 1:1 clay minerals (kaolinite and halloysite) in contrast to more mafic rock over which 2:1 clays develop.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{many other}} <b>soils,</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>soils</b> often are {{subjected}} to strong hillslope processes that distinctly affect their properties. At unstable sites, erosion and other mass movements lead to a continuous rejuvenation of the soil. Under such circumstances weathering rates are kept at high levels, as new parent material is intermittently exposed, leading {{to the development of}} a shallow <b>soil</b> cover. <b>Mountain</b> <b>soils</b> are highly dynamic systems that may react sensitively to environmental changes. In addition, they may accumulate a substantial amount of organic carbon. However, the sometimes high C stocks are under threat due to the changing climate and increasing land-use pressures...|$|R

50|$|In some desert <b>soils,</b> in many <b>mountain</b> <b>soils</b> with {{moderate}} to steep slopes, in many recently eroded bedrock soils, and in various other soils, the biomantle constitutes the entire soil. That is, neither soil horizons nor weathering zones underlie the biomantle. Such biomantles are whole-soil biomantles.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>soils,</b> often {{characterized}} by shallow soils on steep slopes, have received relatively {{little interest in}} soil science. The areas where they occur {{are thought to be}} sparsely populated and the soils themselves only suitable for marginal pastures and forests. They are often not sampled and this lack of knowledge is in stark contrast with their overall extent and their importance to provide a livelihood for 12 % of the Earth’s population. The classification of Leptosols, the main <b>mountain</b> <b>soils,</b> on the contrary, has become more complex over the years. From three simple classes in the FAO Legend of 1974, the number of sub-classes has exponentially grown to at least 36 units in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. It is highly recommended that this number be revised downward...|$|R

Choropleth maps use color hue and intensity to contrast differences between regions, such as demographic or economic statistics.|$|R

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the <b>mountain</b> <b>soils,</b> heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|R
