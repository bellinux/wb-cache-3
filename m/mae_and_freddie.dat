5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, UBS {{settled a}} lawsuit filed against it and 17 other banks by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the U.S. federal agency that oversees Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac, with a payout of US$885 million, but without UBS having to admit any wrongdoing. At {{the time of the}} {{settlement}}, the agency already settle with two other institutions, but UBS settlement was the first where the amount paid was released to public.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|Sexually {{abused by}} her brothers, Kate Barker runs away to become {{involved}} in bootlegging. She marries decent George Barker and gives birth to four sons, Herman, Arthur ("Doc"), Lloyd <b>and</b> <b>Freddie.</b> However, when George's law-abiding ways fail to provide for the family, [...] "Ma" [...] encourages her sons to commit crimes. Soon they become notorious criminals. FBI leader, J Edgar Hoover puts agent Melvin Purvis on the case. Meanwhile Alvin Karpis joins the gang. An attempted robbery leaves one Barker son, Herman, dead, <b>and</b> another <b>Freddie,</b> captured. Arthur Dunlop, a corrupt prison guard, helps <b>Freddie</b> escape <b>and</b> becomes <b>Ma's</b> lover. Dunlop plans a kidnapping that will net them $100,000, but it nearly goes wrong because of his incompetence. The gang kill him. They also kill another incompetent associate, a mob-doctor who messes up an attempt at plastic surgery. By this time Purvis is onto them. Lloyd and Arthur are arrested in Chicago, <b>and</b> <b>Ma</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> are killed in a shootout in Florida.|$|R
5000|$|On January 8, 1935, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{surrounded}} a Chicago {{apartment building}} at 3920 North Pine Grove, {{looking for the}} remaining members of the Barker Gang. A brief shootout erupted, resulting {{in the death of}} bank robber Russell Gibson. Taken into custody were Doc Barker, Byron Bolton, and two women. While interrogating agents got nothing out of Barker, Bolton (a hitherto obscure criminal) proved to be a [...] "geyser of information", as one crime historian called him. Bolton, a former Navy machine-gunner and associate of Egan's Rats, had been the valet of the Chicago hit man Fred Goetz. Bolton was privy to many of the Barker Gang's crimes and pinpointed the Florida hideout of <b>Ma</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Barker (both of whom were killed in a shootout with the FBI a week later). Bolton claimed to have taken part in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre with Goetz, Fred Burke, and several others.|$|R
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that U.S. government officials were considering {{a plan for}} the U.S. government to take over Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> smaller <b>Freddie</b> Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump.

He worked during the day as an auditor at Union Planters National Bank and went to college at night to earn his BBA degree in finance (minoring in accounting) from Memphis State University in 1971. While at Union Planters, he was transferred to another local branch where it just so happened that Stax Records did its banking. That is where he got his introduction into the music industry.|$|R

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|R

25|$|On October 24, 2012, American federal {{prosecutors}} filed a $1 billion civil lawsuit against Bank of America for mortgage fraud under the False Claims Act, which provides for possible penalties of triple the damages suffered. The government asserted that Countrywide, which {{was acquired by}} Bank of America, rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and forced taxpayers to guarantee billions of bad loans through Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. The suit was filed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, the inspector general of FHFA and the special inspector for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In March 2014, Bank of America settled the suit by agreeing to pay $6.3 billion to Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac and to buy back around $3.2 billion worth of mortgage bonds.|$|E

5000|$|Estimates of {{subprime}} loan purchases by Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> {{have ranged}} from zero to trillions of dollars. For example, in 2008 Economist Paul Krugman erroneously claimed that Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> [...] "didn't do any subprime lending, because they can't; {{the definition of a}} subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{their book}} on the {{financial}} crisis Business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera argue that the charges against Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> are [...] "completely upside down; Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> raced to get into subprime mortgages because they feared being left behind by their nongovernment competitors." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the next}} few episodes ("iLost My Mind", [...] "iDate Sam & Freddie", [...] "iCan't Take It", and [...] "iLove You"), the Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> {{relationship}} is growing.

This starts driving Carly mad when Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> end up going to Carly at 3 {{in the morning for}} a stupid fight. Carly then ends up being dragged into a dinner date with Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> but gets really upset when she has to sit at a table by herself. After a second fight between the two, Carly loses it and goes home leaving Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> confused.In the next episode, Spencer is forced to lie to Mrs. Benson about the whereabouts of Freddie because she doesn't know about his and Sam's relationship. Because Sam is in a relationship with Freddie, her previous torture monkey, her new torture monkey is Gibby. Gibby doesn't like how Sam treats him so he decides to consult with Mrs. Benson about Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie's</b> relationship. She doesn't approve. In the next episode, Carly suggests that Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> try each other's hobbies, but when Sam visits Freddie's model train club she blows up the trains, Freddie gets kicked out. Then Sam takes Freddie to visit her Uncle Carmine and Cousin Chaz in prison, but she also makes him put ham in his pants which eventually gets him caught by security, angering Carmine and Chaz. Sam <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> end up deciding to break up at the end because of something Carly said that they overheard about their relationship being forced by a connection they have but their personalities are too different. The relationship ends on a relatively friendly note, with hints of rekindling should one of them work on their personality.|$|R

The bill, {{if it were}} passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. The bill would require {{that the cost of}} direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.|$|E
