5|$|Funding for Green Line {{construction}} {{fell into}} place in 1985. Pressured by the previous year's Congressional action, the Reagan administration sought to provide WMATA with $250 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> four years to expand the system to , a plan which would not fund construction of the system beyond the proposed Southern Avenue Station.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration {{said that it would}} cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E

25|$|A large {{majority}} of the funding for elite sport in the United Kingdom is commercially generated, but this is concentrated heavily on a few sports. For example, the English Premiership's 20 clubs had an estimated combined turnover of £1.25 billion in 2003-04 according to Deloitte, and British professional football's total income was {{in the region of}} £2 billion. Other major sports have a turnover in low nine figures or the tens of millions. For example, cricket is highly dependent on its TV contract, which was worth £55 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the 2006-09 seasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is to be}} {{the centerpiece}} of an educational/cultural center, to include a satellite campus of the University of South Dakota, with a classroom building and residence hall, made possible by a 2.5 million donation in 2007 from T. Denny Sanford, a philanthropist from Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It is called the University and Medical Training Center for the North American Indian and the Indian Museum of North America. The current visitor complex will anchor the center. Sanford also donated 5 million to the memorial, to be paid 1 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> five years as matching donations were raised, specifically to further work on the horse's head.|$|E

5000|$|As infrastructure, {{the cost}} of {{building}} the Etihad Campus does not count towards the FFP financial calculation because it is not considered to be football-related; however, any income generated will, and therefore will greatly assist Manchester City in meeting the UEFA requirements and providing a vital new revenue stream which could create <b>millions</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the club. Manchester City are in the unique position of having acres of vacant land adjacent to their stadium and this potential was quickly recognised by Sheikh Mansour and Khaldoon Al Mubarak just weeks after taking over City in September 2008. Some have speculated that City will maximise regeneration; football finance expert Tom Cannon has stated that the plans are [...] "probably the most exciting of any ground in Europe".|$|R
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits. When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Supremes, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan dominated the charts. Parker admitted in 1983 that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 2004, Stern {{announced}} his five-year contract with Sirius Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service, {{free from the}} FCC's regulations. A contributing factor in the decision was {{the aftermath of the}} Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy which began the tightening of censorship and regulation in broadcasting. The deal, worth approximately $100 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> all costs, included a bonus stock payment of $83 million for Stern in January 2007 for surpassing subscriber goals set in 2004. Promotion of Sirius met with controversy as Stern mentioned the service on air, instructing listeners in purchasing receivers and subscriptions. In one incident, Farid Suleman of Citadel Broadcasting billed Stern $200,000 for the continual advertising mentions. On November 8, 2005, Stern was suspended for one day for excessive promotion of the service.|$|E
25|$|On November 13, 2006, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that the ballpark would be called Citi Field, named for Citigroup Inc. Citigroup will be paying $20 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the naming rights to the park over the next 20 years. This made Citi Field the second major league sports venue in the New York metropolitan area and {{the first in the}} city itself to be named for a corporate sponsor. At the time, the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey's Meadowlands Sports Complex had carried the Continental Airlines name; since then Prudential Center in Newark, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, Red Bull Arena in Harrison, and Barclays Center in Brooklyn have all opened under corporate sponsorship. The deal includes an option on both sides to extend the contract to 40 years, and is the most expensive sports-stadium naming rights agreement ever, subsequently equaled by MetLife Stadium's $400 million deal.|$|E
50|$|Leeches became {{especially}} {{popular in}} the early nineteenth century.

25|$|In the United States, {{demand for}} 8 and 16-bit {{computers}} all but ceased as the 1990s began and PC compatibles became completely dominant, but the C64 {{continued to be}} popular in the UK and other European countries. It was not lack of demand or {{the cost of the}} C64 itself (still profitable at a retail price point between £44 and £50), but the cost of producing the disk drive, that ended the machine's long run. In March 1994, at CeBIT in Hanover, Germany, Commodore announced that the C64 would be finally discontinued in 1995, noting that the Commodore 1541 cost more than the C64 itself. However, only one month later, in April 1994, the company filed for bankruptcy. It has been widely claimed that between 18 and 22 million C64s were sold worldwide, however company sales records indicate that the total number was about 12.5 million. While only 360,000 C64s were sold in 1982, about 1.3 million were sold in 1983, followed by a major spike in 1984 when 2.6 million were sold. After that, sales held steady at between 1.3 and 1.6 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the decade and then dropped off after 1989.|$|E
25|$|Stern's first {{contract}} with Sirius was worth $500 million; {{a budget of}} $100 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> production, staff, and programming costs. In 2005, he formed two channels, Howard 100 and Howard 101, which launched in September, and formed Howard 100 News, a team of news reporters hired to report daily stories surrounding the radio show and those associated with it. Stern ended his eleven-year association with E! and secured {{a deal with the}} iN DEMAND network to launch Howard Stern On Demand, an digital cable video-on-demand service, to broadcast uncensored tapings of the Sirius radio show. The service was relaunched as HowardTV in March 2006 and lasted until it was discontinued in December 2013. A new, state-of-the-art studio and office space was constructed for the show at Sirius' headquarters in New York City. On January 9, 2006, the day of his first broadcast on Sirius, Stern and Buchwald received a total of 34.3 million shares of Sirius stock worth $218 million for exceeding agreed subscriber number targets set when the contract was signed. A second subscriber bonus was met in January 2007, and Stern received 22 million shares of stock worth $82.9 million. In 2006, Time magazine included Stern in its Time 100 list, who also ranked seventh on Forbes Celebrity 100 list in June 2006. When Sirius merged with rival service XM Satellite Radio in 2008 to form SiriusXM, the company paid Stern $25 million as per a clause in his contract.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 1975, the MTA {{announced}} that a 4.4 percent cutback of rush hour train service would take place on January 18, 1976. The cutbacks, the third of the year, trimmed 279 train runs from the previous 6,900. Service was most drastically reduced on the Lexington Avenue Line, with seven fewer express trains during the morning rush hour heading southbound. The cuts were {{the first of a}} three-phase program that was put in effect between January and July 1976. The cuts permitted a savings of $12.6 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the NYCTA, which had an increasing deficit. Other subway services were changed or discontinued as part of the plan. On January 19, F trains were planned to stop running express in Brooklyn, and the GG was to be cut back to Smith–Ninth Streets. In April it was planned that all rush hour 1 trains would begin running to 242nd Street; these runs had previously terminated at 137th Street. During midday hours, trains on the 1 were to be shortened to five cars. In July, it was planned that the EE would be discontinued; N trains were to have been extended to Continental Avenue via the Queens Boulevard Line to replace it. Manhattan-bound N trains were to continue running express, while in the opposite direction they would run local. N trains would alternate between terminating at Whitehall Street or Coney Island during rush hours. CC trains, in July, were planned to be extended from Hudson Terminal to Rockaway Park replacing the E, which was to have been cut back to Hudson Terminal. The K was planned to be discontinued in July.|$|E

50|$|It {{had plans}} to build <b>a</b> new £27 <b>million</b> {{hospital}} in Ludlow, replacing the existing Ludlow Hospital, but an error in calculating how many patients would use the new site, which would have also included new facilities for two GP surgeries, led to a funding shortfall of £1.1 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Plans <b>for</b> the new hospital have now been shelved.|$|R
25|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the first building to be constructed, the Internal Revenue building, was laid by Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon on May 25, 1929. While digging its foundation, workers uncovered a dock which was at least 100 years old. Indiana Limestone {{was used for the}} facing, and Tennessee marble for the columns. The sites of all the Triangle buildings had been established in their revised positions by May 1929, with two exceptions: The positions of the Justice and Archives buildings remained as originally planned (with Justice in the east), and the apex space remained unalloted. President (and former Commerce Secretary) Herbert Hoover laid the {{cornerstone of}} the Commerce building on June 10, 1929, using the same trowel President George Washington had used to lay the {{cornerstone of the}} U.S. Capitol. The construction contract for the Commerce building (set at $13.567 million) had been signed in March, and the contract for its limestone facade—according to at least one newspaper account, the largest stone contract in world history—was awarded in April. By then, the cost of the Commerce building had risen to $17.5 million. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and several submerged streams nearby, more than 18,000 pilings had to be set to construct the Commerce building. Water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek made it too difficult to drive the piles, so a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 feet (6.1 metres) deep into the earth. A hose was inserted into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The October 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression led newly elected President Herbert Hoover to increase spending on existing public works as a means of stimulating the economy. No funds had been authorized yet for the Archives, Independent Offices, Justice, or Labor buildings, and Hoover secured an additional $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> 10 years from Congress for this purpose. Work on the Justice and Independent Offices/Labor buildings now proceeded.|$|E
