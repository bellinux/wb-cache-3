5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are <b>multilingual.</b> Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are <b>multilingual</b> and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} whether there is a bilingual advantage in the segmentation of an unfamiliar language. Speech segmentation is the method where speakers break up the speech stream into syllables and words. De la Cruz Pavia and colleagues suggest that both monolinguals and <b>multilinguals</b> will use prosodic cues to learn the language. Otake & Yoneyama (1998) suggest that <b>multilinguals</b> will only apply one speech segmentation strategy at a time in learning a language. Meanwhile, Salvatierra & Rosselli (2010) suggest that <b>multilinguals</b> may have similar performance because there is more to sift through. In the current study, participants listened to a short passage of Welsh, a language unfamiliar to all participants. Participants then heard a list of 70 words: 35 real Welsh words from the passage and 35 nonsense words constructed from parts of the real words in the passage. Participants indicated whether the words they heard were words of Welsh. There {{was no significant difference in}} performance between <b>multilinguals</b> and monolinguals; however, there was a significant main effect of accuracy, such that all participants had significantly more "correct" responses than "incorrect" responses. These results indicate that all participants learned to segment Welsh, but <b>multilinguals</b> did not outperform monolinguals...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine whether}} multilingualism contributes to the development of greater perceptual sensitivity to non-native speech contrasts. Combining an AX discrimination task and an Event-Related Potential experiment using an oddball paradigm, monolinguals, bilinguals and <b>multilinguals</b> were compared in their ability to discriminate a non-native contrast before and after receiving training as well as in their ability to transfer this training to a new but similar contrast. The experiment was based on a "pre-test [...] training [...] post-test" design, with 4 to 5 days between sessions. At the behavioural level, the effect of Group was significant only at Post-Test for {{the experiment}}al contrast. Post-hoc analyses indicated that <b>multilinguals</b> were significantly more accurate than all of the other groups except for late bilinguals who were also more accurate than the control group which did not receive training. Moreover, <b>multilinguals</b> and late bilinguals were the only groups which improved significantly from Pre-Test to Post-Test. At the neurophysiological level, the effect of Group reached significance at Pre-Test for the experimental contrast and at Post-Test for both the experimental and transfer contrasts. At Pre-Test and Post-Test, monolinguals, late bilinguals and the control group exhibited a Mismatch Negativity (MMN) in the midline and the right side electrodes, while <b>multilinguals</b> and early bilinguals exhibited a bilateral MMN. The increase in MMN amplitude from Pre-Test to Post-Test was greater for <b>multilinguals</b> and both groups of bilinguals, compared to monolinguals and the control group. As for the Test of Transfer, monolinguals and the control group exhibited a right lateralised MMN, while <b>multilinguals</b> and both groups of bilinguals exhibited a bilateral MMN. The results of the behavioural and ERP experiments indicate that <b>multilinguals</b> and bilinguals have enhanced perceptual sensitivity and a greater ability to learn a new contrast. Multilingualism seems to boost perceptual sensitivity and learning abilities. Moreover, the age at which a second language is learned may affect speech perception at both levels differently. Finally, since initial group differences were only found in the ERP data, the results indicate that differences at the neurophysiological level may transpire before or without any differences at the behavioural level...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates inter-individual {{variation}} (linked to personality traits, multilingualism and sociobiographical variables) in the attitudes that 2035 <b>multilinguals</b> have {{of their own}} and others‚Äô Foreign Accent (FA). Data were collected through an on-line questionnaire. We found that extraverted <b>multilinguals,</b> who were emotionally stable and tolerant of ambiguity were significantly less bothered by the FA of others. Only more neurotic <b>multilinguals</b> were bothered by their own FA. Unexpectedly, participants who knew more languages to a higher level were more negative about the FA of others and their own. However, participants who grew up in an ethnically diverse environment, who had lived abroad and who were working in an ethically diverse environment were significantly more positive about FA. While sex had no effect on the attitudes towards the FA of others, women had a more negative attitude towards their own FA. Education level and age were also linked to attitudes towards FA. The findings thus show that how much <b>multilinguals</b> are bothered by FA falls partly outside their conscious control as it depends on their personality, their language learning history, their current linguistic practices and their sociobiographical background...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{structural}} {{studies have}} established that experience shapes and reshapes the brain throughout a lifetime. The impact of early development, however, {{is still a}} matter of debate. Further clues may come from studying <b>multilinguals</b> who acquired their second language at different ages. We investigated adult <b>multilinguals</b> who spoke three languages fluently, where the third language was learned in classroom settings, not {{before the age of}} 9 years. <b>Multilinguals</b> exposed to 2 languages simultaneously from birth (SiM) were contrasted with multinguals who acquired their first two languages successively (SuM). Whole brain voxel based morphometry revealed that, relative to SuM, SiM have significantly lower grey matter volume in several language-associated cortical areas in both hemispheres: bilaterally in medial and inferior frontal gyrus, in the right medial temporal gyrus and inferior posterior parietal gyrus, {{as well as in the}} left inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, as shown by others, successive language learning increases the volume of language-associated cortical areas. In brains exposed early on and simultaneously to more than one language, however, learning of additional languages seems to have less impact. We conclude that - at least with respect to language acquisition - early developmental influences are maintained and influence experience-dependent plasticity well into adulthood...|$|R

Nearly 1600 <b>multilinguals</b> {{from all over the world}} participated in the research. The results suggest that how and when a language was learnt determines future use and communicative anxiety. Aspects such as present use of the language, the total number of languages known, and the level of emotional intelligence also play an important role.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of crosslinguistic {{influence}} in <b>multilinguals</b> who, besides their mother tongue Croatian, also speak English and Spanish. The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish whether the <b>multilinguals</b> use other languages they know in spoken and written production, and whether they use previously acquired skills and findings related to those languages during that process. The theoretical part of the paper covers the definitions of the concept of crosslinguistic influence, history of the development of the field, as well as possible theories why crosslinguistic influence appears or does not appear in particular cases. Furthermore, what is briefly discussed are the separateness of languages in the brain and numerous factors which influence the occurrence of CLI. Finally, there is a short overview of the status of English and Spanish languages in Croatia. The research part consists of two studies comparing two groups of language users: one where participants are not proficient speakers of English and Spanish, but still possess enough knowledge to be called <b>multilinguals,</b> and the other whose participants are at a high level of both languages. The language samples were obtained through the qualitative method of gathering data, i. e. writing compositions on a certain topic (group 1) and translation of texts and oral interview (group 2), while the data obtained were analyzed and systematized according to the type of influence.
