5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> group of noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E

5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> number of women, who had died {{during the war and}} these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the open}} {{streambed}} to render medical assistance.

His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area.

Ratna does not approve of it. Pingalan takes her away by force. Veerangan saves her from Pingalan's clutches. The duo then free Marthandan and Karmegam, who had been captured by Vijayavarman and is now reformed. Both Marthandan and Veerangan defeat Vijayavarman. Veerangan marries Ratna, and Marthandan issues a proclamation stating that Ratnapuri is a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Milton Blockhouse was an {{artillery}} fortification constructed {{as part of}} Henry VIII's Device plan of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England.

5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} {{get along}} with each other, {{differed}} {{on how to deal}} with the British threat.

Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.|$|E
