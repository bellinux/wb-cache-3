30|$|The {{next step}} in the {{empirical}} approach consists in attributing measures for task contents to each field of study. This way, each of the 79 fields of study is associated with its most closely related occupation, which is quite straightforward in most of the cases, and the task content of this occupation is assigned to the corresponding area of study. Each field of study is represented by only one 4 -digit occupation. Although the assignment of the occupation most closely related to a given field of study has some degree of arbitrariness, classifying workers into matched, weakly matched, and mismatched is much more challenging, since the boundaries for these categories are usually unclear. For example, the occupation most closely associated with a degree in mechanical engineering is mechanical engineer, {{but it is not clear}} how an individual with a degree in mechanical engineering who works as a civil engineer or as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technician</b> would be classified. Appendix Table  6 shows the field of study-occupation matches, and the occupations defined as the most closely associated with each area of study.|$|E

30|$|Further {{analysis}} {{established that}} the source of the statistical significance observed was due to the differences between the pairs of the groups: civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against electrical <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, EETI) and civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, METI).|$|R
30|$|The {{observed}} {{value of the}} F-statistic was 6.71, while its corresponding tabulated value at the significance level α[*]=[*] 0.05 was 3.00. Thus, the null hypothesis was rejected, indicating {{the existence of a}} statistically significant difference in the mathematics taught to the civil, the electrical, and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> technical students with regard to relevance to the industries in Uganda of specific topics taught. Further analysis showed that the source of the statistical significance observed was due to the difference between the pairs of the groups: civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against electrical <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, EETI) and civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, METI).|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} {{relevance}} to industry, while the mathematical {{view of the}} <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industry could significantly differ {{from that of the}} mathematics educators, there could exist a difference among the mathematical views of the civil, electrical, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industry (Markes 2006). Similarly, the views of the civil, electrical, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> mathematics educators might also differ. Further, {{on the question of the}} relevance of the mathematics taught to the needs of the industries, it is deemed in the study that there exists a difference in view of those students who have had and those who have not had practical industrial experience.|$|R
30|$|The {{hypotheses}} H 07 and H 08 were however rejected. Thus, it {{was concluded}} that {{there was no significant difference}} in the mathematics taught to the civil, the electrical, and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> technical students at the polytechnics. Obviously, there are specific areas where the interests of different groups of the <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> differ (Liebenberg and Mathews 2012). Advisably, in designing mathematics courses for <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians,</b> there is a need for core mathematics topics, useful to all, and other elective mathematics topics so as to cater for the needs of the individual groups of <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> more effectively (National Research Council 2011).|$|R
