5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke {{was born}} in Tunis in 1978. She is of Russian-Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports {{academic}} and her mother a chemist.

Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study <b>modern</b> <b>dance.</b> With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art.

The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the <b>Modern</b> <b>Dance</b> exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.|$|E
