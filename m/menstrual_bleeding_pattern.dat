40|$|Contraceptive progestogens have {{a series}} of effects on the {{endometrium}} that depend on the existence of oestrogen priming and therefore on the time of administration, the route through which the hormone is released to the body (systemic or locally in utero) and the available daily dose. The effects of a contraceptive progestogen can be divided into two main categories: changes in the endometrial structure and vascularization and alterations of the <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> Whereas orally administered progestogens usually cause endometrial decidualization and an important stromal reaction, the i. m., or local, intrauterine delivery is more apt to cause atrophia. Finally, all progestogens, when given alone at contraceptive doses (and irrespective of their mechanism of action), cause some disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns.

40|$|Changes in women’s <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> {{precede the}} onset of menopause. In this paper, the authors {{identify}} population subgroups based on menstrual characteristics of the menopausal transition experience. Using the TREMIN data set (1943 – 1979), the authors apply a Bayesian change-point model with 8 parameters for each woman that summarize change in <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> during the menopausal transition. The authors then use estimates from this model to classify menstrual patterns into subgroups using a K-medoids algorithm. They identify 6 subgroups of women whose transition experience can be distinguished by age at onset, variability of the menstrual cycle, and duration of the early transition. These results suggest that for most women, mean and variance change points are well aligned with proposed bleeding markers of the menopausal transition, but for some women they are not clearly associated. Increasing understanding of population differences in the transition experience may lead to new insights into ovarian aging. Because of age inclusion criteria, most longitudinal studies of the menopausal transition probably include only {{a subset of the}} 6 subgroups of women identified in this paper, suggesting a potential bias in the understanding of both the menopausal transition and the linkage between the transition and chronic disease. menopause; menstrual cycle; ovary; women’s health Abbreviations: FMP, final menstrual period; SE, standard error...|$|R

40|$|Background: Heavy menstrual {{bleeding}} is {{an important}} health problem. Two frequently used therapies are the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS) and endometrial ablation. The LNG-IUS can be applied easily by the general practitioner, which saves costs, but has considerable failure rates. As an alternative, endometrial ablation is also very effective, but this treatment has to be performed by a gynaecologist. Due to lack of direct comparison of LNG-IUS with endometrial ablation, {{there is no evidence}} based preferred advice for the use of one of these treatment possibilities. Method/design: A multicenter randomised controlled trial, organised in a network infrastructure in the Netherlands in which general practitioners and gynaecologists collaborate. Women >= 34 years with heavy menstrual bleeding, a Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score exceeding 150 points and no future child wish can participate in the trial. After informed consent, women will be randomised to a strategy starting with a levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system or a strategy starting with endometrial ablation. The primary outcome is the PBAC score at 24 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes are patient satisfaction, complications, number of re-interventions, <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern,</b> quality of life, sexual function, sick leave and costs. As predictors of effect of intervention we also meaure level of coagulation factors. Discusson: This study, considering both effectiveness and cost effectiveness of LNG-IUS versus endometrial ablation may well improve care for women with heavy menstrual bleeding. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To assess {{awareness}} of {{and interest in}} intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use among HIV-positive women in Cape Town, South Africa. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Methods. HIV-positive women aged 18 through 45 years presenting for care at a primary health care clinic in Cape Town, South Africa participated in this study. Consented participants completed a staff-administered questionnaire in a private setting. Descriptive statistics were generated. Comparisons between demographic and reproductive health-related variables and IUCD awareness and interest were performed with multiple logistic regression. Analyses for IUCD interest excluded women with prior surgical sterilization. Results. Of 277 HIV-positive women, 37 % {{were aware of the}} IUCD; awareness was independently associated with greater age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1. 15, 95 %; confidence interval (CI) : 1. 10 – 1. 20) and not switching contraceptive methods in the last year (AOR = 2. 45, 95 % CI: 1. 03 – 5. 83).

40|$|Background & Aim: Job {{stress can}} {{interfere}} with endocrine function and result in dysfunctional menstrual bleeding patterns. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the relationship between job stress with <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern</b> among midwives. Methods & Materials: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 150 midwives working in hospitals and health centers of Mashhad using two-stage sampling. Data were collected using a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, Karazek Job Content, a daily diary for menstrual periods to record duration and interval of periods, and the Higham Chart for recording the bleeding amount. The diary was completed for three menstrual periods. Collected data were analyzed using independent t-student, one way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U, Chi-squared test, correlation test and linear regression in the SPSS- 14. Results: The findings showed that 21. 3 % of the midwives reported mild job stress, 19. 3 % had moderate stress and 59. 3 % reported severe job stress. Mean of the duration of the periods was 7. 06 days, the mean interval of the periods was 27. 9 days and the mean amount of bleeding was 79. 72 cc. There was a significant relationship between job stress and the duration and interval of periods (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills (OCPs) containing {{estrogen and}} progestin or progestin only were introduced as a contraceptive option {{for women in}} 1960. Since their introduction to the market, there have been {{significant changes in the}} drug content and formulations of these products, in part to decrease the risk of adverse effects. The OCP products available today, particularly combined oral estrogen and progestin products (COCs), continue to be widely used. The major adverse effect associated with COCs is an increased risk of a cardiovascular event. COCs are contraindicated for women with increased cardiovascular risk, increased thromboembolic risk, significant liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or migraine with aura. In addition, both COCs and progestin-only pills (POPs) are contraindicated in patients with a personal history of breast cancer. Commonly reported minor adverse effects may include <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern</b> changes, breast tenderness, headache, mood changes, and nausea. Frequently these minor adverse effects subside following the initial 3 months of appropriately administered therapy, and otherwise may be managed by changing the hormone strength or product formulation and confirming patient adherence. It is imperative that providers are familiar with the potential adverse effects associated with OCP use, so they may in turn educate and counsel patients. Since adverse effects are the primary reason for OCP discontinuation, it is critical that patients are made aware of and expect these in advance and are counseled how to minimize or manage adverse effects. It {{is important to note that}} many women also use OCPs for noncontraceptive benefits, such as regulating menstrual irregularities, treatment of premenstrual syndrome, prevention of menstrual migraine, treatment of acne, and others.

40|$|Background: Contraceptive {{implants}} (including Jadelle) {{are highly}} effective, safe, {{and easy to}} use and have a long duration of action. They do not interfere with intercourse with immediate return to fertility after removal. However, disruption of the <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern</b> is almost inevitable and coercive prescription may be a problem because insertion and removal of implants are provider dependent. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the sociodemographic profiles of acceptors of Jadelle and the reasons for discontinuation in Jos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This was a 6 -year retrospective chart review carried out at the Jos University Teaching Hospital. Results: About 1401 women accepted Jadelle with a mean (΁standard deviation) of 33. 4 ΁ 5. 9 years. About 88 % of the women were Christians and almost three-quarters (73. 5 %) had at least secondary school education. The means of parity and number of children still alive at the time of accepting Jadelle were 4. 1 and 3. 8, respectively. Half of the women (49. 5 %) were breastfeeding and over half (55. 9 %) had future fertility desires at the time of commencing Jadelle. About 82 % had previously used other contraceptives (mostly short-acting methods such as injectables, pills, and condoms), with only 18 % starting Jadelle as the first-ever contraceptive method. About 90 % of the women had regular menstrual cycles. The major reason for discontinuation of Jadelle was desire for pregnancy although menstrual pattern disruption was the most common reason for removal in the first 6 months of use.

Materials and Methods: A total of 36 women was treated with ORM 60 mg and OCP containing 30 μg ethinyl estradiol and 150 μg desogestrel was given to 34 women. Pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) was applied to assess the amount of bleeding. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were compared using a t-test (paired and unpaired) and Mann-Whitney U-test for numerical variables and McNemar′s Chi-square test for categorical variables. Results: The primary outcome showed a comparable PBAC score of ORM in first posttreatment cycle and significantly better in following two cycles (PBAC - postC 1 : 0. 118, PBAC - postC 2 : 0. 016, and PBAC - postC 3 : 0. 04).

40|$|BACKGROUND Aquaporins (AQPs) are water {{channels}} {{present in}} the cell wall, allowing water – and occasionally other molecules – to pass the cell membrane. So far 13 AQPs {{have been found in}} humans. Their function is to maintain the cell internal milieu by regulating water and ion equilibrium. AQPs can be found in virtually all cell types and tissues and are essential to the normal function of cells and organs. Malfunction of the water channels can cause disease. The uterine wall consists of three layers of which the endometrium is the innermost portion, facing the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes structural changes during the menstrual cycle, influenced by the hormones estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), as a preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones. This process is essential for regeneration of the endometrium after shedding during menstruation. Excessive uterine bleeding, also called menorrhagia, is a common gynecological disorder, presenting with large menstrual bleedings and reduced quality of life for those affected. Several organic diseases can lead to excessive uterine bleeding, but in most of the cases the cause is unknown. Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid which has the ability to bind to P-receptors, thereby mainly blocking the effect of P. Mifepristone treatment improves <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern</b> and has an effect on endometrial vessels. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDIES The general objective of the studies was to gain knowledge about the expression and hormonal regulation of AQPs in the uterus as well as to investigate the connection between AQPs and uterine function in healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with excessive uterine bleeding. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS AQP 1 and AQP 2 are present in human endometrium; AQP 1 in endothelial cells (lining the interior surface of blood vessels) and AQP 2 in epithelial cells (lining cavities, surface structures, and glands). They can be assumed to be involved in events where water transport is essential, e. g. menstruation and reduction of uterine fluid volume at the time of implantation. AQP 1 levels in the endometrium are reduced in women with excessive uterine bleeding, indicating that an impaired expression of AQP 1 could be a cause to this condition. Mifepristone treatment increases AQP 1 expression in human endometrium, which could imply a regulation by P. In cell culture, it was possible to show a hormonal regulation of certain AQPs: AQP 1 protein-expression was up-regulated in endothelial cells when exposed to E, as well as to P; AQP 2 mRNA levels increased after exposure to E + IC, and P combined with mifepristone, and AQP 7 protein-expression increased after treatment with E + IC, and E + P, suggesting a role for these AQPs in increased endometrial secretion after ovulation...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the possible association between menstrual cycle pattern and occurrence of surgically treated myomas and also to check if depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection earlier in reproductive life can affect the later occurrence of myomas needing surgical treatment. Methods: In a case&ndash;control study in Ardabil, 85 women with definite diagnosis of surgically treated uterine leiomyoma and 154 community controls were enrolled. Possible predictors of myoma including menstrual cycle and <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> were assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS, IBM, Somers, NY). Odds ratios were used as the main statistic in assessing the strength of observed associations. Results: Mean age of the participants was 41. 8 &plusmn; 8. 5 years. Length of menstrual cycle was associated with myoma and a higher likelihood of myoma was observed among those having shorter menstrual cycles (P&nbsp;&lt; 0. 05). Number of <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> days was also associated with surgically treated myoma and longer bleeding periods increased the likelihood of myoma (P&nbsp;&lt; 0. 05). Only one of the eight women who had a history of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate injections had developed surgically treated uterine leiomyoma and the others belonged to the control group without a history of surgical treatment for uterine leiomyoma.

Outcome measures were lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip BMD by dual-energy X-ray densitometry (DXA). Explanatory variables were estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from serum collected in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle or menstrual status [premenopausal (menses in the 3 months prior to study entry without change in regularity) or early perimenopause (<b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> in the 3 months prior to study entry but some change in the regularity of cycles) ]. Total testosterone and estradiol concentrations were indexed to SHBG for the Free Androgen Index (FAI) and the Free Estradiol Index (FEI). Serum logFSH concentrations were inversely correlated with BMD (r = − 10 for lumbar spine [95 % confidence interval (CI) : − 0. 13, − 0. 06] and r = − 0. 08 for femoral neck (95 % CI: − 0. 11, − 0. 05).

We examined {{the effect of a}} tailored pill regimen, compared with the standard regimen, on continuation and satisfaction rates at 1 year and associated <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns.</b> Study Design This was a randomized controlled trial with 503 women aged 18 - 45 years. Women were randomized to either the standard regimen (21 daily pills followed by a 7 -day pill-free interval) or tailored regimen (daily pills until three consecutive days bleeding triggers a 3 -day pill-free interval) of Microgynon 30 ® (ethinyl oestradiol 30 mcg, levonorgestrel 150 mcg). Primary outcome was COC continuation at 12 months; secondary outcomes included satisfaction with pill regimen regarding contraception and <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> Daily electronic diaries were used to record women's pill use, switching to other contraceptive methods, <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and satisfaction levels. Results Eighty-three percent of women were already taking the COC at recruitment, 13 % were restarting the COC and 4 % were first time COC users. Seventy-one percent of all women were followed up at 12 months. Continuation rates at 1 year were 82 % in the tailored arm versus 80 % in the standard arm [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 67 - 1. 91]. Satisfaction with contraceptive regimen was 86 % (tailored) versus 94 % (standard) (OR= 0. 37; 95 % CI= 0. 17 - 0. 79), and satisfaction with <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern</b> was 79 % versus 87 %, respectively (OR= 0. 53; 95 % CI= 0. 30 - 0. 93). Median number of bleeding days per month was 2. 4 (tailored) and 4. 9 (standard). Incidence, duration and intensity of bleeding episodes were significantly lower in the tailored arm. Conclusions In women familiar with standard use of the COC, switching to tailored COC use or continuing with standard use were both associated with high COC continuation rates and high satisfaction with contraceptive regimen and <b>bleeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> While significant differences tended to favor the standard group, tailored COC use was associated with significantly less bleeding, suited some women very well and can provide a suitable alternative to standard use. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

This could be particularly so as patients who underwent treatment from the TBEA device (older population of follow-up), which was shown to have a poorer outcome compared to TBEA-III device, have subsequently undergone the menopause [9]. All women were advised to quantify their period-related symptoms prior to menopause if they already had achieved menopause since LA-Thermachoice. To minimise this bias, we have reported our figures after excluding those women who had undergone the menopause. This therefore represents the most conservative but pragmatic situation regarding the long-term outcome following LA-Thermachoice. Another important issue for questionnaire research is responder and non-responder bias. To minimise this bias, we tried to increase our response rate by contacting eligible patients multiple times. We managed to receive a good response rate to our survey, with 78  % of women completing the survey, which was better than the mean response of other mail surveys [19]. The response rate may reflect women who are not willing to respond to postal questionnaires, those who may not recall their symptoms before LA-Thermachoice, natural loss of patients in long-term studies, and those where questionnaire was ultimately determined undeliverable due to incorrect address.|$|R
40|$|Background: The major side-effect of progestogen-only {{contraception}} is {{disruption of}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{which can lead}} to a high incidence of early discontinuation. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare three treatments with placebo on the duration and recurrence of frequent and/or prolonged bleeding in Implanon users. Method: Women between the ages of 18 and 45 years, who had used Implanon for ≥ 3 months and were experiencing prolonged or frequent <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns,</b> were recruited at four Australian sites. Subjects were randomized to treatment using computer-generated random number table if they met the World Health Organization criteria for prolonged and/or frequent bleeding in the previous 90 days [Belsey, E. M., Pinol, A. P. Y. and Taskforce on Long-Acting Systemic Agents for Fertility Regulation, World Health Organization (1997) Contraception 55, 57 - 65]. Treatments were: (1) mifepristone 25 mg given twice on day 1 followed by 4 days of twice daily placebo; (2) mifepristone 25 mg given twice on day 1 followed by 4 days of ethinyl estradiol (EE) 20 μg in the morning and placebo at night; (3) doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days; and (4) placebo twice daily for 5 days. Analysis was by intention to treat. The primary endpoint was the number of days of bleeding and spotting immediately following initiation of the 5 day course of each active therapy compared with placebo. Results: A total of 179 women was assigned to treatment. Both mifepristone in combination with EE and doxycycline alone were significantly more effective in stopping an episode of bleeding {mean 4. 3 days [confidence interval (CI) 3. 5 - 5. 2], and 4. 8 days (CI 3. 9 - 5. 8) respectively} than mifepristone alone or placebo [5. 9 days (CI 4. 8 - 7. 2) and 7. 5 days (CI 6. 1 - 9. 1) respectively]. No effect on subsequent <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> was observed in any treatment group. Conclusion: Both mifepristone plus EE and doxycycline alone were significantly more effective than placebo in terminating an episode of bleeding in women with prolonged and/or frequent bleeding using Implanon. We believe that the observed reduction in the number of bleeding days by almost 50 % compared to placebo in both the mifepristone combination group and the doxycycline group demonstrates a clinically significant improvement in <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and that further trials are needed to compare different combinations of therapy as well as multiple dosing regimens in order to establish which is the most effective treatment option. The effect of repeat administration or combinations of these preparations on long-term <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically {{identify}} a treatment-independent statistical method to describe clinically relevant <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> by using <b>bleeding</b> diaries of clinical studies on various sex hormone containing drugs. Methods We used the four cluster analysis methods single, average and complete linkage as well as the method of Ward for the <b>pattern</b> recognition in <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> diaries. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the semi-partial R 2, the cubic cluster criterion, the pseudo-F- and the pseudo-t 2 -statistic. Finally, the interpretability of the results from a gynecological point of view was assessed. Results The method of Ward yielded distinct clusters of the bleeding diaries. The other methods successively chained the observations into one cluster. The optimal number of distinctive <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> was six. We found two desirable and four undesirable <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns.</b> Cyclic and non cyclic <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> were well separated.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Most {{women in}} the course of their lives will {{experience}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Some have bleeding almost all the time. Different approaches have been proposed and drugs with fewer side effects are preferred. The aim of this study was to compare the ef-fects of herbal medicines (fennelin & vitagnus) and mefenamic acid in the treatment of severity of <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Materials & Methods: This double blind clinical trial was carried out in one hundred and five students with severe <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> at Hamadan University of medical sciences in 2010. The students were randomly grouped in four groups and herbal medicines of fennelin & vitagnus, mefenamic acid and placebo. The severity of <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> was detected by the Higham table during one cycle before and two cycles after the intervention. The data analyzed by SPSS/ 16 and P< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Demographic characteristics of the students were similar in the four groups. There was not a significant difference in the mean of severity of <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> during the one cycle before intervention between the four groups, but the difference was significant dur-ing the two cycles after the intervention. Mefenamic acid reduces <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> com-pared with vitagnus & fennelin and showed no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: All three drugs; mefenamic acid, fennelin and vitagnus have been effective in reducing <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The two herbal medicines (vitagnus and fennelin) can be used as effective and safe drugs to reduce <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2014; 21 (3) : 171 - 176...|$|R
40|$|Luis Bahamondes, Ilza Monteiro, Arlete FernandesHuman Reproduction Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medical Sciences and National Institute of Hormones and Women&rsquo;s Health, University of Campinas, Campinas, BrazilAbstract: The first {{combined}} {{oral contraceptive}} (OC) {{was launched in}} the US 50 years ago and was followed by another formulation introduced in Germany one year later. The most common estrogen component in current formulations is ethinylestradiol; however, many concerns have been raised {{with respect to this}} estrogen. Although the natural estrogen produced by the ovary, 17 -beta estradiol, is the most potent of the estrogens, it is poorly absorbed orally, and previous attempts to use it in combined OCs have been unsuccessful due to the occurrence of irregular bleeding. Recently, a new combined OC was developed containing a natural estrogen, estradiol valerate, and a new progestin, dienogest, in a dynamic 26 -day, four-phasic (estrogen stepdown and progestin stepup) scheme of administration. In clinical trials, its contraceptive performance was excellent, with good cycle control and <b>bleeding</b> <b>patterns</b> compared with other combined OCs or with placebo. This review focuses predominantly on the use of an estradiol valerate-dienogest combined OC for the treatment of heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The findings of two large, randomized, controlled trials have shown that this combined OC constitutes an effective treatment for women with heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> representing a new therapeutic option to reduce menstrual blood loss. Further studies are necessary to confirm these data. Keywords: dienogest, estradiol valerate, heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> menorrhagia, contraceptio...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBleeding {{disorders}} {{have been}} recognized as important etiologic or contributory factors in women with heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Fibrinolysis in the endometrium {{plays a role in}} heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> It is unknown whether increased systemic fibrinolysis might also increase the risk of heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> ObjectiveTo investigate fibrinolytic parameters, including clot lysis time, in women with heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> MethodsWe included 102 patients referred for heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> (Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart score of > 100) in our cohort. Patients and controls (28 healthy volunteers without heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding)</b> underwent hemostatic testing in the first week after menstruation. For 79 patients and all controls, fibrinolytic parameters (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasmin inhibitor levels) and clot lysis time were available. ResultsFibrinolytic parameters were similar between patients and controls, except for thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (89. 4 % vs. 82. 5 %) and plasmin inhibitor (106 % vs. 96 %), the levels of which which were significantly higher in patients. In women with menorrhagia without gynecologic abnormalities, we found lower thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 levels than in women with gynecologic abnormalities (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, 85. 4 % vs. 94. 8 %; plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, 16. 0 gL(- 1) vs. 24. 5 gL(- 1)). ConclusionSystemic fibrinolytic capacity is not increased in women with heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Overall, levels of the fibrinolytic inhibitors thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasmin inhibitor were even higher in patients than in controls. However, in a subgroup of women without gynecologic abnormalities, relatively lower levels of inhibitors may contribute to the heavy <b>menstrual</b> <b>bleeding...</b>|$|R
