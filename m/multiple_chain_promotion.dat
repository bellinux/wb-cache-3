40|$|We study dimer {{coverings}} on random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains.</b> A <b>multiple</b> <b>chain</b> is a planar honeycomb lattice {{constructed by}} successively fusing {{copies of a}} 'straight' condensed hexagonal chain {{at the bottom of}} the previous one in two possible ways. A random <b>multiple</b> <b>chain</b> is then generated by admitting the Bernoulli distribution on the two types of fusing, which describes a zeroth-order Markov process. We determine the expectation of the number of the pure dimer coverings (perfect matchings) over the ensemble of random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> by the transfer matrix approach. Our result shows that, with only two exceptions, the average of the logarithm of this expectation (i. e., the annealed entropy per dimer) is asymptotically nonzero when the fusing process goes to infinity and the length of the hexagonal chain is fixed, though it is zero when the fusing process and the length of the hexagonal chain go to infinity simultaneously. Some numerical results are provided to support our conclusion, from which we can see that the asymptotic behavior fits well to the theoretical results. We also apply the transfer matrix approach to the quenched entropy and reveal that the quenched entropy of random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> has a close connection with the well-known Lyapunov exponent of random matrices. Using the theory of Lyapunov exponents we show that, for some random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains,</b> the quenched entropy per dimer is strictly smaller than the annealed one when the fusing process goes to infinity. Finally, we determine the expectation of the free energy per dimer over the ensemble of the random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> in which the three types of dimers in different orientations are distinguished, and specify a series of non-random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> whose free energy per dimer is asymptotically equal to this expectation.

By applying algebraic and combinatorial techniques we establish a calculating expression of the MD partition function for bipartite graphs, which corresponds to the permanent of a matrix. Further, by using the transfer matrix argument we show that the computing problem of the permanent of high order matrix can be converted into some lower order matrices for this family of lattices, based on which we derive an explicit recurrence formula for evaluating the MD partition function of <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> and random <b>multiple</b> <b>chains.</b> Finally, we analyze the expectation {{of the number of}} monomer-dimer arrangements on a random <b>multiple</b> <b>chain</b> and the asymptotic behavior of the annealed MD entropy when the <b>multiple</b> <b>chain</b> becomes infinite in width and length, respectively.

Most scan flip-flops are deactivated during test application. The first stage includes <b>multiple</b> scan <b>chains,</b> where each scan chain is driven by a primary input. Each scan flip-flop in the <b>multiple</b> scan <b>chains</b> drives a group of scan flip-flops in the second stage. Scan flip-flops in different stages use separate clock signals.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new stereo {{matching}} method using the population-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Pop-MCMC), which {{belongs to the}} sampling-based methods. Since the previous MCMC methods produce only one sample at a time, only local moves are available. In contrast, the proposed Pop-MCMC uses <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> in parallel and produces multiple samples at a time. It thereby enables global moves by exchanging information between samples, which in turn, leads to faster mixing rate. In the view of optimization, {{it means that we}} can reach a lower energy state rapidly. In order to apply Pop-MCMC to the stereo matching problem, we design two effective 2 -D mutation and crossover moves among <b>multiple</b> <b>chains</b> to explore a high dimensional state space efficiently. The experimental results on real stereo images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm gives much faster convergence rate than conventional sampling-based methods including SA (Simulated Annealing) and SWC (Swendsen-Wang Cuts). And it also gives consistently lower energy solutions than BP (Belief Propagation) in our experiments. In addition, we also analyze the effect of each move in Pop-MCMC and examine the effect of parameters such as temperature and the number of the chains...|$|R
