They are very good in expressing how presentation of products in store should look like. Quality of product presentation influences turnover of the store.

That is why many <b>merchandising</b> <b>departments</b> only create limited number of standard planograms. This thesis contains general analysis of planograms and discussion of main advantages and disadvantages of standard planograms production. The proposed solution solves disadvantages of standard planograms. <b>Merchandising</b> <b>departments</b> can use the solution to produce precise planograms for all of their stores with need of nearly same effort as in case of standard planograms. Described algorithm is able to generate precise planograms automatically from universal planograms that are created instead of standard planograms.

Unilever- a British-Dutch based company {{is one of the}} oldest and most renowned multinational companies in the world.

Unilever Bangladesh Ltd., being a subsidiary of the Unilever in Bangladesh has also become one of the leading multinational business firms in the world of FMCG industry. Over the years the company has been growing by bringing world class innovative products to the people of Bangladesh.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} in the Apparel, Interiors and <b>Merchandising</b> <b>Department</b> (AIM) of Oregon State University {{were reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon woven textiles and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon woven textiles. The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread count, fiber content, direction of spin, ply, degree of twist, yarn diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon woven textiles in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon woven textiles was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and <b>Merchandising</b> <b>Department</b> of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. Thread count, direction of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles, from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and <b>Merchandising</b> <b>Department</b> of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed. Even though the two sets of data populations (data from known Ancon textiles and data from the AIM collection) could not be compared statistically, some information was gained by a review and comparison of simple frequencies of internal patterns. Thread count frequencies for both populations exhibited internal patterns...|$|E

After LPG (Liberalization, Privatization & Globalization) the business gets more important and now merchandising is on its hot seats. So, it is necessary to understand the day to day happenings of the star department. In the field of marketing and services, Merchandiser is at a position of utmost importance, He is the person who co-ordinates with various departments for a uniform business.

40|$|As part of Wal-Mart’s Sustainability 360 initiative, {{the company}} seeks {{to find and}} {{eliminate}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) in its products. Wal-Mart plans to engage its supply chain in a product-level analysis of GHGs. Ultimately, Wal-Mart plans to use a carbon scorecard for two purposes: (1) as a <b>merchandising</b> <b>department</b> tool to reward suppliers that demonstrate superior environmental performance, and (2) as a business development tool in other departments at Wal-Mart. This master’s project examines the initial pilot phase of the supply chain initiative, designed with three questions in mind: Where is the carbon in the supply chain? Can a dual-purpose scorecard exist? Is this scorecard commercially viable? The pilot introduced 35 vendors from 7 product categories to carbon footprinting and gave them a Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) questionnaire specifically designed for Wal-Mart suppliers. The questionnaire requires the vendors to reach one step back in their own supply chain to determine direct and indirect sources of GHGs allocated to the products they make. The questionnaire results indicate {{a wide range of}} embedded carbon values and provide insight into the energy intensity of packaging formats; however, pilot participant feedback indicates data inaccuracy due to low response rates from vendors’ suppliers. Because it is infeasible to engage closely with Wal-Mart’s approximately 66, 000 suppliers, focus after the pilot needs to concentrate on the most energy intensive products. Life cycle analyses (LCAs) of Wal-Mart’s 3, 000 retail product categories can identify 20 percent (approximately 600) of the categories that are (1) most energy intensive, (2) show the greatest sales volume, and (3) provide Wal-Mart with an opportunity to assist in energy efficiency. Wal-Mart will ask representatives of the identified categories to fill out the CDP questionnaire. The resulting data will yield one of the two initiative purposes—Wal-Mart’s energy department could assist some suppliers in energy efficiency mechanisms, creating commercial viability for the scorecard. Fulfilling the second initiative will require a second scorecard to rate a firm’s climate strategy and yield a simple score Wal-Mart’s <b>merchandising</b> <b>department</b> can use to rank suppliers and reward top performers...|$|E

The Bangladeshi apparel industry is very large and diverse, employing 6 million people and accounting for 87 per cent of the country's exports. The apparel industry plays a pivotal role as a key driver of the national economy and has grown to be the most significant contributor to the country's economy over nearly three decades of its existence. However, during last 10 years, the industry's actions, government policies as well as market events have begun to converge, providing several growth opportunities for the sector domestically as well as in the global market. As the MFA quota-regime ended, Bangladesh presented many opportunities for buyers, suppliers and investors to collaborate with its textile industry, and to profit from the partnership. While the industry recorded a remarkable growth in a protected market environment, it faces a series of challenges that have come to the fore in the post-quota situation, notably in areas such as: • Price competitiveness. • Faster lead times. • High raw material base. • Full service offering.
