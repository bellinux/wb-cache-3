5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal point as it is {{analysed}} in detail in I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in <b>more</b> <b>detail,</b> {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing.

5|$|English {{biologist}} Thomas Henry Huxley reconsidered {{the fish}} scales described by Agassiz and considered them {{to belong to}} a crocodilian. He first proposed this to the Geological Society of London in 1858, and went into <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> in an 1875 paper in the society's quarterly journal. By this time, new material had been uncovered from Elgin that indicated that Stagonolepis was not a fish, but a reptile. However, Stagonolepis was still known primarily by scutes and imprints of scutes, many of which were not well preserved.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford {{published}} The True History of the Elephant Man, {{presenting the}} fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House.

5|$|It was {{discovered}} in October 1851 by William Lassell and named for a character in two different pieces of literature. As of 2017, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon's surface. There are no active plans at present to return to study the moon in <b>more</b> <b>detail,</b> although various concepts such as a Uranus orbiter and probe have been proposed from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in <b>more</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|E

Rowling later explained her position in <b>more</b> <b>detail,</b> saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their {{followers}} being {{an integral part of}} the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> than others.|$|E

Since his introduction in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas has received positive critical response from video game publications with most of them focusing on his development in 358/2 Days.

5|$|The Semantic Web {{uses the}} HTTP URI scheme to {{identify}} both documents and concepts {{in the real}} world, a distinction which has caused confusion {{as to how to}} distinguish the two. The TAG published an e-mail in 2005 on how to solve the problem, which became known as the httpRange-14 resolution. The W3C subsequently published an Interest Group Note titled Cool URIs for the Semantic Web, which explained the use of content negotiation and the HTTP 303 response code for redirections in <b>more</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|E
