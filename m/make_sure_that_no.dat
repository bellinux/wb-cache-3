5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line of scrimmage to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E

25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board.

25|$|Unfortunately, at the Storybrooke Sheriff station, {{it turns}} out King Arthur is not as honest as he seems; {{he found out that}} the heroes lied to him about Emma was the Dark One when they first entered Camelot and lied about the magic bean.

It's also revealed that Grif was a minion of Arthur, and in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one finds out his plans, Arthur convinces the squire to drink a vial of Agrabah Doom Viper poison.

25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful not to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E

50|$|In {{programming}} languages with lexical scoping that do {{not reflect}} over variable names, α-conversion (or α-renaming) {{can be used to}} make name resolution easy by finding a substitution <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> variable name masks another name in a containing scope.Alpha-renaming can make static code analysis easier since only the alpha renamer needs to understand the language's scoping rules.|$|R

The lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] begins with Beyoncé telling her birthdate [...] "9-4-8-1", followed by a group of male voices singing [...] "hey's" [...] and [...] "jump's" [...] for four bars; the first verse then begins. The verses are written like a list where she sings her missions before going to party. It is followed with the chorus and the hook, where Beyoncé sings: [...] "Can you get me bodied?

The clinking of ice against the glass, the removal of the kettle from the hob, tended to prejudice his answers... was therefore particularly careful to make all his preparations beforehand; the iced tubes were filled and jugs of hot and cold water ranged within easy reach of his hand, so that the water of the temperature required might be mixed silently." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Khrushchev {{found out}} about America's NASA cover story, he {{developed}} a political trap for Eisenhower. His plan began {{with the release of}} information to the world that a spy plane had been shot down in Soviet territory, but he did not reveal that the pilot of this plane had also been found and that he was alive. With the information that Khrushchev released, the Americans believed that {{they would be able to}} continue with their cover story that the crashed plane was a weather research aircraft and not a military spy plane. The cover-up said that the pilot of the U-2 weather plane had radioed in that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties while flying over Turkey. From there they claimed that the plane could have continued on its path because of auto-pilot, and that this could be the plane that crashed in the Soviet Union. The final attempt to make the cover story seem as real as possible was the grounding of all U-2 planes for mandatory inspection of oxygen systems in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> other [...] "weather missions" [...] would have the same result as the one that was lost and possibly crashed in the Soviet Union.|$|E

With completed new stories appearing over a span of 60 years, he is in fact the longest-running of Wodehouse's characters, topping Jeeves and Wooster (1915-1974, or 59 years) and the denizens of Blandings Castle (1915-1969, or 54 years).|$|R

30|$|A {{potential}} new father must detect three consecutive idle slots before attempting to broadcast a beacon packet. In this way, the node <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> neighbouring nodes are still {{engaged in a}} collision resolution process.

For the same reasons, new nodes willing to join the network must also sense three consecutive empty slots before issuing a DSC packet. Once again, it is worth to mention that the beacon broadcast should be properly scheduled using a scheduling scheme such as the one proposed by the IEEE 802.15. 4 Task Group [14].|$|R
