500|$|Failing to {{make the}} UK Albums Chart, Reverberation was the poorest {{performing}} Echo & the Bunnymen album at that time. Echo & the Bunnymen were dropped by WEA Records in early 1991. After touring East Asia, the band launched their own label, Euphoric Records, in October 1991 {{with the release of}} their self-produced single [...] "Prove Me Wrong". The release of another single, [...] "Inside <b>Me,</b> <b>Inside</b> You", followed in March 1992. With neither of the singles released on Euphoric reaching the UK Singles Chart, the band undertook an extensive tour of the United States before finally disbanding in early 1993.|$|E
500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth/If you let <b>me</b> <b>inside</b> your world,' he sings. The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E
500|$|On November 30, 1961 he {{was traded}} to the San Francisco Giants along with Don Larsen in {{exchange}} for four players (three of them pitchers) who had spent most or all of 1961 in the minor leagues. Giants manager Alvin Dark declared his intent to use Pierce as the ace of a young pitching staff that included developing talents such as Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and Mike McCormick. Unlike the White Sox, the Giants featured a powerful offense which included Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda, and Pierce took advantage of the improved run support with his new team, winning his first eight starts before suffering a 4–3 loss on June 7. His first start on April 13 was a deeply rewarding one, after a rough spring training in which he recorded a 16.45 ERA. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he retired the first 13 batters and allowed only two hits in 7⅓ innings. The crowd of 23,755 gave him a roaring ovation, and he later said, [...] "The cheers really got to <b>me</b> <b>inside.</b> Fans nowhere could have been more wonderful. I felt it way down deep." ...|$|E
5000|$|Killing <b>Me</b> <b>Inside's</b> third studio album, One Reason, was {{released}} in September 2012, and produced the singles [...] "Menyesal", [...] "Never Go Back" [...] and [...] "For One Last Time".

500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn <b>me</b> <b>inside</b> out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{artists have}} had hits with songs that Twitty {{recorded}} but never released as singles.

2500|$|The {{third track}} [...] "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop song. It {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". The song was praised for its intricate production {{and has been}} compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone and Circus, and also to Janet Jackson and Madonna's album Ray of Light (1998) and song Music (2000). Spears crescendos: [...] "Baby shut your mouth and turn <b>me</b> <b>inside</b> out" [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy", referencing her songs [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". [...] "I Wanna Go", the fourth track, is a dance-pop and Hi-NRG song, that includes elements of techno and a heavy bassline. The song contains a whistled melody. In the chorus, she stutters: [...] "I-I-I wanna go-o-o / All the wa-a-ay / Taking out my freak tonight". The [...] "builds and breaks" [...] were compared to her album Blackout.|$|E
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed <b>me</b> <b>inside</b> it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Bowen classifies {{motherhood}} as {{a central}} problem in The House in Paris. [...] The machinations of Mme Fisher, of course, are {{the worst of all}} of the novel's mothers. In the past Max recalled of Mme Fisher, [...] "she acted on me like acid on a plate," [...] while Karen thought, [...] "She is a woman who sells girls; she is a witch." [...] After Mme Fisher contributed to Max's suicide, even her daughter Naomi [...] "saw then, that evil dominated our house." [...] In fact, Neil Corcoran sees Mme Fisher as [...] "quasi-vampiric," [...] since she [...] "does indeed draw blood from Max, when he slits his wrist in the house in front of her." [...] Additionally, Mrs. Michaelis presented some apathy and detachment to her daughter, although Karen {{went so far as to}} classify her mother as [...] "ruthless." [...] At one point, Karen was aware that her mother's passive-aggressive parenting caused a key power shift between them: [...] "She has made me lie for a week. [...] She will hold <b>me</b> <b>inside</b> the lie till she makes me lose the power I felt I had." [...] Aware of these troubling examples, in the present Karen longs to correct her abandonment and be a [...] "natural mother" [...] to Leopold, but her son realises that [...] "she would not lend herself to him." [...] Neil Corcoran calls Leopold's reaction to his mother's failure [...] "the novel's most concentrated expression of the psychological and emotional wounding that is parentlessness." [...] Bowen's attention to motherhood continues throughout her oeuvre, attending to difficult maternal figures like Mrs. Kelway in The Heat of the Day and Lady Naylor in The Last September, for example.|$|E
