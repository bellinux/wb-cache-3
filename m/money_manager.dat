40|$|Financial {{investment}} {{has become increasingly}} important on commodity exchanges. This paper distinguishes two types of financial investors and emphasizes differences in their position taking motivation and price impacts. Index traders follow a passive strategy holding virtually only long positions. <b>Money</b> <b>managers</b> trade {{on both sides of}} the market and attempt to maximize short-term returns. Regression analysis indicates that: (i) index trader positions are particularly influenced by roll returns, while <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> emphasize spot returns; and that: (ii) <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> moved from emphasizing diversification to a more speculative strategy by taking commodity positions that are positively, rather than negatively, related to developments in equity markets. Granger-causality tests indicate that these differences translate into different price impacts: (i) index trader positions have a causal price impact particularly for agricultural commodities; and (ii) <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> had a causal impact during the sharp increases in the prices for some non-agricultural commodities. ...|$|R

Using Korean data, we show that foreign <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> pay more than domestic <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> when they buy and receive less when they sell for medium and large trades.

2500|$|Goldman {{argued that}} CDSs are marked to market (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their {{positions}} netted between counterparties daily. Thus, {{as the cost}} of insuring AIG's obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs. The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock-on defaults, had AIG been allowed to fail. However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy. If the government let AIG default, according to <b>money</b> <b>manager</b> Michael Lewitt, [...] "its collapse would be as close to an extinction-level event as the financial markets have seen since the Great Depression".|$|E
2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove <b>money.</b> <b>Manager</b> risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E
