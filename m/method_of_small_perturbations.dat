40|$|The {{stability}} of a baroclinic zonal flow is studied {{by means of}} the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> without imposing geostrophic balance on the perturbations. In other respects the present treatment of the stability problem is within the same framework as most other studies on the subject. The removal of the geostrophic aasumption makes the results applicable to low lati-tudes and provides thereby some insight into the conditions under which tropical disturbances may form. The theory leads to increased understanding of conditions favoring deviations from geostrophic flow and explains why observed perturbations are for the most part quaaigeostrophic. Furthermore, it reconciles results of some previous studies which within the narrower framework of geostrophic theory appeared unconnected. Two cases of generalization of previous results by other investigators are studied. The first of these extend results of EADY (1949) and FJ~RTOPT (1950), the second cam extends results obtained by CHARNEY (1947), HOLMBOE (1959), and ARNASON (1961).

40|$|Abstract—The {{position}} perturbations {{of linear}} antenna elements {{are used for}} designing non-uniformly spaced reconfigurable antennas radiating with multiple pattern such that the same amplitude distribution and perturbed positions produces either a pencil or a flat topped beam, the difference being dependent upon phase distribution of the array. The <b>perturbation</b> <b>method</b> consists <b>of</b> inducing <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> in the element positions of a linear array to obtain the desired patterns and offer the flexibility of simple design and is similar to other adaptive techniques like phase only or phase/amplitude synthesis. The problem of finding the element position perturbations is treated as a non linear problem and has been solved using a the generalized generation gap steady state genetic algorithm (G 3 - GA) using parent centric crossover. In the G 3 -GA approach the population diversity versus selection pressure problem considers both the parent selection and the replacement plans of GA. The positionphase synthesis method using the G 3 -GA approach is compared with the G 3 -GA phase-only synthesis technique. It is seen that, an optimal set of element-perturbed positions in a constrained position range with uniform amplitude, unequally spaced elements with unequal phases {{has the potential to}} overcome the design challenge of phase only syntheses that uses a larger number of elements to get the same desired side lobe level. Further when the main beam is scanned it is found that the proposed method can maintain a sidelobe level. without distortion during beam steering for the angular positions studied...|$|R

40|$|Two {{problems}} involving electromagnetic scattering from irregular interfaces are treated, both deterministic {{and statistical}} irregularities being considered. First, {{reflection of a}} partially polarized plane wave from a plane interface with large irregularities is studied using geometrical optics. Matrix transformations relating incident and reflected waves are obtained for reflection from a single specular point and from an extended area containing many independent reflectors. The properties of a wave reflected from a diffusely illuminated rough interface are found, and these results are used to study reflection noise reduction when a polarization-sensitive detector viewing near the Brewster angle is used in infrared temperature measurements. Second, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> is used to study scattering of an arbitrary completely polarized wave from an irregular interface of general underlying shape. The irregularities are replaced by equivalent surface currents and then the field in space is found using the dyadic Green's functions of the unperturbed problem. The results obtained are valid when the irregularity has small slope and amplitude small compared to the wavelength and local radii of curvature. To facilitate applications, the theory of dyadic Green's functions is developed, and the necessary functions are evaluated for simple geometries. As an example, the first perturbation is calculated for scattering from a perfectly conducting cylinder with sinusoidal irregularities...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} equations are linearized by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> for {{the conditions}} of hydrostatic equilibrium and geostrophic balance of meridional forces. In a first case, Fickian momentum diffusion is used; in a second case, a shear- and latitude-dependent eddy viscosity is used. A wave solution for the zonal wind oscillation, having in meridional profile {{the shape of a}} probability curve, is substituted in the equation of zonal motion. This procedure leads first to conditions on parameters, next to a solution for the meridional wind, and, through the remaining perturbation equations, finally to solutions for the remaining perturbation quantities. The tempernture perturbation follows from thc thermal wind equation and has the same probability curve shape in meridional profile as does the zonal wind disturbance. The conditions on parameters and the resulting solutions show that the assumed forms of eddy diffusion of momentum cannot undcr any circumstancc account for momentum changes in the non-attenuating layer (above about 25 km.), but may, to the extent that mean vertical motion over the equator is negligible, he applied at the levels where the oscillation attenuates downward (below about 25 km.).

40|$|A {{new model}} of strain {{localization}} and damage band formation, inspired by population dynamics, is introduced in this paper. The basic assumption is that strain at nanoscales can be described {{by means of a}} kinetic model of molecular interaction. The strain energy induced by external sources concentrates at a numerable set of mobile entities, hereby called “strainions”. Under normal conditions these strain energy accumulators are uniformly distributed within the body. If the energy level between some molecules increases too sharply, for instance due to increasing strains, the strainions begin to dissipate heat energy and strain localization may occur. By coupling the Fick’s law for diffusion and a classical conservation law for heat production, the random motion of heat energy can be modelled. A number of physical parameters are introduced in the model. These are a proportionality constant k that measures the strength of heat attraction (called the “thermotaxis ” coefficient), a “motility ” constant c, and a diffusion constant D. A differential system of two nonlinear equations is obtained, which admits the uniform solution, corresponding to the equilibrium state. Then, we investigate, through the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations,</b> if a sudden small disturbance to the uniform state remains local and extinguishes, or propagates in space and time, leading to strain localization and damage. We found that strain localization occurs if the motility c of the strainions or the decay rate of the heat concentration are small or, inversely, if the rate of heat production or the thermotaxis coefficient k are large. ...|$|E

The {{focus is on}} the model of a uniformly stratified heat-conducting viscous fluid. It is shown that the <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> can be conveniently described by several scalar quasipotentials.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{increasing}} the pressure ratio per stage of an axial flow compressor is studied in part by considering the effect of boundary layer control by area suction on the three dimensional turbulent boundary layer flow on the casing in one stage of a compressor. The effect of this boundary layer control, on the prevention of separation is investigated. Crossflow and crosswise variation of crossflow in the boundary layer are factors contributing to the tendency toward separation {{and the effect of}} boundary layer control on this phenomenon is determined. This analysis is limited to the boundary layer on the casing and does not take into consideration the possible separation taking place at the blades. The boundary layer equations are used to obtain the momentum integral equations with suction applied at the surface. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> is applied to the equations in order to simplify them so that a solution may be reached with relatively little effort. Expressions are assumed for the boundary layer profiles, flow path outside the boundary layer, and shear stresses. These are in a form which closely resembles the actual conditions. In order to show what effect boundary layer control exerts, a simplified single stage compressor is studied. The results show that crossflow can be reduced by applying suction to the boundary layer with a resultant decreased tendency toward separation of the flow, but this is reached only after a certain minimum suction velocity is attained, If the suction velocity is less than this minimum, in spite of the decrease in boundary layer thickness the crossflow will be increased over that of a solid wall and likewise the tendency toward separation will increase...|$|E

Controlled wetting-drying of these blocks, collected from a dam reservoir, mimics field ponding-desiccation conditions of the topsoil layer subject to caustic solar radiation, high temperature and wind, typical in the Batinah region of Oman. In 1 -D analytical modelling of a transient Richards’ equation for vertical evaporation, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> is applied, assuming that the relative permeability is Avery-anov’s 3. 5 -power function of the moisture content and capillary pressure is a given (measured) function. A linearized advective dispersion equation is solved {{with respect to the}} second term in the series expansion of the moisture content as a function of spatial coordinates and time. For a single block of a nite thickness we solve a boundary value problem with a no- ow condition at the bottom and a constant moisture content at the surface. Preliminary comparisons with theta-, TDR- probes measuring the moisture content and temperature at several in-block points are made. Results corroborate that a 3 -D heterogeneity of soil physical properties, in particular, horizontal and vertical capillary barriers emerging on the interfaces between silt and sand generate eco-niches with stored soil water compartments favourable for lush vegetation in desert conditions. Desiccation significantly increases the temperature in the blocks and re-wetting of the blocks reduces the daily average and peak temperatures, the latter by almost 15 °C. This is important for planning irrigation in smartly designed soil substrates and sustainability of wild plants in the region where the top soil peak temperature in the study area exceeds 70 °C in Summer but smartly structured soils maintain lash vegetation.

40|$|The {{method of}} thermogas {{impact on the}} oil bearing layer is a {{perspective}} one to improve oil recovery. It is now under experimental implementation in Belarus. Stability of the thermal front {{and that of the}} oil displacement is a point of principle for the given technology. The article offers solution based on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations</b> for the problem of the oil-displacement front stability under thermogas impact on the oil layer. The perturbation growth increment is shown to be quite {{different from that of the}} gas filtration combustion. Being determined by the perturbation wave number (or wave length), by difference in speed of the blowing filtration and that of the heat development front, by the ratios of densities, filtration coefficients, compressibility of the displacement agent and the displaced oil mass, and by other parameters. The author analyses the main parameters influencing the stability of the front. Recommendations are given on possible methods and procedures improving stability of the displacement front (neutralizing perturbation growth). The mechanisms of suppression or compensation of the front perturbation growth are as follows: the crude oil viscosity reduction and increase of that of the displacement agent, the displacement agent compressibility increase, increase of the thermogas impact heat-front width in the first instance at the expense of the temperature growth and alteration in the chemism (low temperature catalysts utilization, etc.), reduction in speed of the front propagation and/or correspondingly of the displacement agent feed. Utilization of the gas or water-gas displacement agent as well as the agent impregnation with hydrophobic gases provides a relatively better stability of the front as compared to that employing water based compounds. Analytical data and derived recommendations are offered for utilization within the framework of general techniques and procedures of the thermogas impact process management in the context of developmental and experimental-industrial oil extraction. Further research into methods and mechanisms of the displacement front perturbation compensation, including the front dynamics at nonlinear stage, might be conducted via detailed 2 D and 3 D numerical simulation of the system.  </p...|$|E

40|$|The wave {{interaction}} model {{the authors have}} developed for the first-order linear homogenous Cauchy system, which is specified by numerical matrices at the spatial derivatives, is considered as applied to the one-dimensional ideal gas flow. The linear waves, meeting model requirements, are separated from quasi-linear process by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations.</b> The resulting linear hyperbolic system is specified by the matrix containing gas parameters and written for the unknown vector, components of which are small perturbations of gas velocity, density, and enthalpy. Following a common practice for a hyperbolic system, the method for solving the system via traveling waves, propagated axially with characteristic speeds, is analyzed for the physical process involved. Three Riemann invariants are found. The general solution is represented as a linear combination of three arbitrary functions of wave-arguments, specified by characteristic speeds. The initial conditions are imposed on the three functions, which can be measured experimentally, to determine the unchangeable form of traveling waves. The formation of characteristic triangle, uniquely determined by gas parameters, is connected with the existence of some closed structure moving in the ideal gas. To hold the matrix form, a 3 -by- 3 diagonal matrix is formatted from the traveling waves as its entries. This matrix is considered as a three-dimensional wave, specified by coefficient matrix with 3 characteristic speeds along its diagonal. Using a similarity transformation, the diagonal matrix coefficient is replaced by the matrix specifying the system to be solved. By analogy with hyperbolic case, an n-dimensional wave, specified by an arbitrary numerical nby-n matrix, is considered as a solution of a first-order Cauchy system specified by this matrix. The Cauchy problem solution is represented as a series expansion in terms of n-dimensional wave with coefficients equal to the coefficients of n-dimensional initial analytic vector Taylor's expansion. It was found that an n-dimensional wave is generated {{by the action of}} differential operator exponential on an n-dimensional analytic initial vector via Cauchy problem for the related system. It is proposed to apply the model to the two-dimensional gasflow using the notion of interaction between the waves propagated along each of two coordinate axes. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} report the {{stability}} of two-dimensional laminar flows of a gas is investigated by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>perturbations.</b> The chief {{emphasis is placed on}} the case of the laminar boundary layer. Part I of the present report deals with the general mathematical theory. The general equations governing one normal mode of the small velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great detail. It is found that for Reynolds numbers of the order of those encountered in most aerodymnic problems, the temperature disturbances have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient ("viscous solutions"). Indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first approximation. Because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is greatly simplified. The final equation determining the characteristic values of the stability problem depends on the "inviscid solutions" and the function of Tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompressible fluid. The second viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem; only the ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved. Part II deals wlth the limiting case of infinite Reynolds numbers. The study of energy relations is very much emphasized. It is shown that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface has a sign opposite to that near {{the outer edge of the}} boundary layer. A general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the Rayleigh-Tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid. If this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the main flow exceeding 1 - 1 /M (where M is the free stream Mach number), then neutral and self-excited "subsonic" disturbances exist in the inviscid fluid. (The subsonic disturbances die out rapidly with distance from the solid surface.) The conditions for the existence of other types of disturbance have not yet been established to this extent of exactness. A formula has been worked out to give the amplitude ratio of incoming and reflected sound waves. It is found in the present investigation that when the solid boundary is heated, the boundary layer flow is destabilized through the change in the distribution of the product of density and vorticity, but stabilized through the increase of kinematic viscosity near the solid boundary. When the solid boundary is cooled, the situation is just the reverse. The actual extent to which these two effects counteract each other can only be settled by actual computation or some approximate estimstes of the minimum critical Reylolds number. This question will be investigated in a subsequent report. Part III deals with {{the stability of}} laminar flows in a perfect gas with the effect of viscosity included. The method for the numerical computation of the stability limit is outlined; detailed numerical calculations will be carried out in a subsequent report...|$|E
