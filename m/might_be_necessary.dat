5|$|Burgoyne's {{army was}} readying {{to cross the}} Hudson at Fort Edward on August 17 when the first word of the battle arrived. Believing that {{reinforcements}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> Burgoyne marched the army toward Bennington until further word arrived that Breymann and the remnants of his force were returning. Stragglers continued to arrive throughout the day and night, while word of the disaster spread within the camp.|$|E

5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. {{military}} was considering future {{operations in the}} Bonin Islands during August 1944 the planners assessed that an occupation of Iwo Jima <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to protect the Marianas from attack, {{and after the war}} this was given as one of the justifications for the costly invasion of the island. However, this was not necessary due {{to the success of the}} Seventh Air Force and the USN's campaign against Iwo Jima's airfields as well as the Japanese military's shortage of long-ranged aircraft. In any event, the decision to invade Iwo Jima was made a month before the major attacks on the B-29 bases began, and there were no raids on the Marianas in the seven weeks before the landings began on February19.|$|E

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Lawrence Hill {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways, which oversaw a gradual decline of services at Lawrence Hill. Passenger numbers along the Clifton Extension Railway, now known as the Severn Beach Line, also dropped, and in 1963 the Beeching report suggested that all services along the line be withdrawn. In the end, services continued to Severn Beach but were discontinued via Henbury and Pilning. Staff were withdrawn from the station from 17 July 1967 as a cost-saving measure. The footbridge was demolished by 1970, forcing passengers to change platform via the steps to Church Road at the south end of the station. Most of the station buildings were demolished in August 1970, but there were still some on the westernmost platform in 1979. By 1974 the platforms serving the eastern tracks had been removed, with the tracks themselves removed in 1984. Plans to use the disused trackbed as part of a light rail scheme linking the city centre to the northern suburbs were formed in the late 1990s, with the aim of an operational scheme by 2008, but the plans had been shelved by 2004. It was suggested in 2008 that the trackbed could be used as a cycle path to join together communities which had been separated by the construction of the M32 motorway, however this was dropped due to Network Rail asserting that the trackbed <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for future rail expansion.|$|E

25|$|In {{the acute}} phase of hemolysis, blood transfusions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> or even {{dialysis}} in acute kidney failure. Blood transfusion {{is an important}} symptomatic measure, as the transfused red cells are generally not G6PD deficient and will live a normal lifespan in the recipient's circulation. Those affected should avoid drugs such as aspirin.|$|E

25|$|Nasal skin defects can be {{corrected}} with a medially based bilobed flap, which is emplaced {{to provide adequate}} skin coverage for wounds limited to the alar lobule. If the entire lobule is missing, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to leave the second-lobe donor-site wound partially open; it will close at 2–4 weeks post-operative; afterwards, the scar can be revised. Nonetheless, the alternative surgical correction is a two-stage, superiorly based, nasolabial flap.|$|E
40|$|Proposition 4. 1121 of the Tractatus {{states that}} {{epistemology}} is {{the philosophy of}} psychology. What should we take this to mean? Philosophy, on Tractarian terms, is an activity by which thoughts are clarified. This activity ranges from checking terms {{to see if they}} have meaning to investigating a network for its regularity. Epistemology, then, would be the philosophical analysis and clarification of any possible psychology, although {{it is not clear what}} a psychology on Tractarian terms would be. Understanding what such a psychology <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> if we <b>are</b> to understand better what this epistemology would demand of us; however, to approach such an understanding, we will need to attend to the notion of subjectivity at work in the Tractatus and to the way it is related to thought and logic...|$|R

25|$|Prophylactic {{vaccination}} (i.e., vaccination of wart-free {{animals to}} prevent infection) with whole virus (e.g. formalin-killed wart tissue suspension), virus-like particles (L1 or L1+L2), L1 protein or (for BPV-4) L2 protein confers long-lasting protection against challenge {{with the same}} BPV type, but is generally ineffective against existing warts. Protection appears to be mediated via type-specific neutralising antibodies. Vaccination of calves as early as 4–6 weeks <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the briefest}} {{sketch of the}} constructions. Note that the constructions {{are exactly the same}} in ZFC and in NFU, except for the {{difference}} in the constructions of the natural numbers: since all variables are restricted to strongly cantorian sets, {{there is no need to}} worry about stratification restrictions. Without the Axiom of Counting, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to introduce some applications of T in a full discussion of these constructions.|$|E
25|$|As the Democrats were {{grappling}} {{with their own}} troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused {{on the issue of}} slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.|$|E

50|$|A study {{incorporating}} comparative target prediction {{and subsequent}} experimental verification of selected predictions, suggests that FnrS <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a more global regulator in Escherichia coli. It {{is predicted to}} control several transcription factors. These include the verified targets marA and IscR. MarA activates genes involved in the resistance to superoxide, which <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> at the anaerobic conditions where FnrS is expressed. IscR regulates genes for iron-sulfur-cluster containing or biogenesis proteins. FnrS <b>might</b> <b>be</b> involved in the observed O2 dependent expression of the IscR regulon. Further targets of FnrS are nagZ and sdhA.|$|R
