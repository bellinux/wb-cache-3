40|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} vehicle emissions, a prime source of air {{pollution}} in many metropolitan areas, require emissions measurements throughout the useful life of the vehicle. A chassis dynamometer is typically used for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> from light-duty vehicles, and often also from in-use heavy-duty vehicles. Chassis dynamometers are, however, relatively few and far between, notably for heavy vehicles, due to their complexity and cost. In many cases, portable, on-board systems are thus used, and the vehicle is tested on the road, in lieu of on a dynamometer. On-road testing is generally not repeatable and subject to many influencing factors, and as such. has the capabilty to cover {{a wide range of}} real-world operation. Sometimes, however, repeatable tests are called for. This paper discusses various methods of reproducing chassis dynamometer driving cycles on a test track or other suitable area. Examples are given from <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> at a local airport. A simple portable, on-board system was used to measure mass emissions of NOx, CO 2 and PM, and a GPS device with a fast (5 Hz) update rate was used as a source of the actual road speed data given as a feedback to the driver. The repeatability of data was generally good, with coefficients of variance of under 10 % among multiple runs of each test. While more accurate transient speed data are available using other devices, GPS offers minimal installation time and universal use on any type of vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{emissions}} {{from the natural}} gas supply chain are {{a key factor in}} determining the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas production and use. Recent estimates of these emissions have varied widely, because of the large population of sources, because of different measurement and estimation approaches, and because of extreme values of emission rates from individual sources that are much larger than population average values of emission rates from sources in the same category (a ‘fat-tail’ distribution). Reconciling differences between ambient methane concentration measurements (top-down methods) and direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> from individual sources (bottom-up methods) is critical to understanding methane {{emissions from}} the natural gas supply chain.

Switchgrass and corn are modeled as competing alternatives to show how the inclusion of a land constraint can influence life cycle rankings and alter policy conclusions. With land use unconstrained, ethanol produced from switchgrass is always an optimal feedstock relative to ethanol produced from corn.

The predominant sources of agricultural GHGs, which represent about 8 % of total Annex I emissions, are methane and nitrous oxide from livestock. Efforts to reduce livestock emissions have so far been limited due to disagreements over the abatement potential, technical feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of the policy instruments available, including market-based measures. Two key challenges facing the application of market-based measures to livestock emissions are evaluated: first, to design a policy framework that appropriately aligns the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions,</b> the abatement options, and the incentives facing livestock producers; second, to address the risk of leakage and economic regrets that arise from unilateral domestic policy action.

40|$|The {{present study}} shows {{the results of}} the {{evaluation}} of the pellets made from two forestry crops and eight agricultural crops in Costa Rica by employing a 50 kW domestic stove. Methods: The following variables were evaluated: flame outlet and flue gas temperatures and emissions (CO 2, CO, NO, NO 2, NOx and SO 2). Results: It was found that the pellet consumption varies from 2. 5 to 3. 4 kg/h, where the former corresponds to Tectona grandis and the latter to the mesocarp oil palm fruit. Flame outlet temperature varied from 400 to 623 °C and flue gas temperature varied from 205 to 322 °C, where the lowest temperature corresponds to Phyllostachys aurea and the highest to the oil palm residue. T. grandis showed the highest variation in temperature, while Cupressus lusitanica showed the lowest variation. A result that stands out in the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> is that the two forestry crops show the lowest values.

40|$|The {{constant}} volume sampling (CVS) {{method has}} been used to support vehicle emissions testing for over 25 years and the ‘bag’ <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> is the key method that is used for legislative purposes. Bag measurements provide a single figure for CO, CO 2, and NOx emissions species for the complete drive cycle, but provide no information on the profile throughout the test. Instantaneous emissions measurements undertaken on a second-by-second basis are carried out to assess catalyst and engine system performance. The key measurement for this approach is the determination of the instantaneous exhaust mass flowrate, which allows the instantaneous gravimetric emissions to be calculated. Being able to accurately measure instantaneous emissions carries its own challenges, but the mixing effects in the CVS system when using the CO 2 tracer technique have been shown to compromise significantly the capability to determine exhaust volume flowrates accurately. The predicted time responses of dilute CO 2 concentration, and the resulting over-underestimate of tailpipe volume flow, display adequate agreement with experimental results. The magnitude of these errors was determined by measurement to be in the region of a 1500 per cent overestimate during tip-outs...|$|E

To evaluate in a laboratory the performance of a system as a whole a test cycle called the Concise Cycle Test (CCT) was developed at SPF.

More recently the SPF test facility was upgraded to a fully automated test rig that fulfills the special requirements of the CCT test method. Subsequent to the physical test sequence the acquired data is then used to generate a measurement-validated simulation model that is further used to evaluate various system setups in light of annual performance summaries.

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{drive toward}} the {{mandated}} lowering and reporting of selected toxicants in tobacco smoke. Several studies have quantified the mainstream cigarette emissions of toxicants, providing benchmark levels. Few, however, have examined how measured toxicant levels {{within a single}} product vary over time due to natural variation in the tobacco, manufacturing and measurement. In a single centre analysis, key toxicants were measured in the tobacco blend and smoke of 3 R 4 F reference cigarette and three commercial products, each sampled monthly for 10 months. For most analytes, monthly variation was low (coefficient of variation < 15 %); but higher (⩾ 20 %) for some compounds present at low (ppb) levels. Reporting toxicant emissions as a ratio to nicotine increased the monthly variation of the 9 analytes proposed for mandated lowering, by 1 – 2 percentage points. Variation in toxicant levels was generally 1. 5 – 1. 7 -fold higher in commercial cigarettes compared with 3 R 4 F over the 10 -month period, but increased up to 3. 5 -fold for analytes measured at ppb level. The potential error (2 CV) associated with single-point-in-time sampling averaged ∼ 20 %. Together, these data demonstrate that <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> from commercial cigarettes is associated with considerable variation for low-level toxicants.

For purposes of determining the obligations of environmental regulations definition of the Minister of Environment should be used. When disposing of sewage sludge in an amount up to 1 % by weight of fuel, emission standards for fuel do not change.

40|$|The first {{tools to}} assess agri-chains {{focused on their}} {{economic}} aspects. Following requests from professionals from different agri-chains, CIRAD undertakes original research to develop methods for the environmental and social assessment of agri-chains. Indeed, although the production of food consumes resources and causes pollution, thus leading to various types of externalities, it remains an essential activity. It also generates positive or adverse social effects. Even though some large multinational companies wish to reduce their environmental impacts or improve their social impact, their desire or willingness is not sufficient. It is necessary to evaluate the environmental and social {{consequences of their actions}} in the most relevant manner possible. This chapter focuses on life cycle assessment methods because they are suitable for a chain-based reasoning and, due to their design, are the only methods that take the transfer of impacts into account. Since the pollution emitted by an agri-chain (or areas of consumption of non-renewable resources) can be spread out over several sites, the life cycle assessment method replaces the direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions.</b> These are indirect assessment methods based on benchmarks stored in databases. Several configurations are possible in order to define boundaries (at least the spatial and temporal boundaries, but also that of affected actors {{in the case of a}} social life cycle assessment) of the system that will be studied by this type of analysis. The extent of change (marginal or extensive which modifies the system's structure itself) also influences the determination of the system's boundaries. The variety and sophistication of tools available for this type of assessment reflects the strong and ever increasing societal demand. The assessment addresses four key requirements: strengthening one's market power, adjusting one's action plan, acquiring knowledge in order to decide, and the need for self-assurance.

In this study, a vented, fabric-covered large chamber (4. 5 × 4. 5 m, 1. 5 m high; encompassing greater spatial variability than a smaller chamber) in combination with on-line analysis (nitrous oxide [N 2 O] and methane [CH 4] via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; 1 analysis min- 1) was tested {{as a means to}} isolate and measure emissions from beef feedlot pen manure sources. An exponential model relating chamber concentrations to ambient gas concentrations, air exchange (e. g., due to poor sealing with the surface; model linear when ≈ 0 m 3 s- 1), and chamber dimensions allowed data to be fitted with high confidence. Alternating manure source emission measurements using the large-chamber and the backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) technique (5 -mo period; bLS validated via tracer gas release, recovery 94 - 104 %) produced comparable N 2 O and CH 4 emission values (no significant difference at P < 0. 05).

40|$|In {{times of}} climate change {{environmental}} protection and the reduction of emissions {{become more and more}} important. Especially the reduction of CO 2 -emissions {{is one of the most}} widely discussed topics at the moment. As transport is one of the biggest polluters in this respect and reduction figures are poor, many politicians demand reduction measures from the transport sector like the reduction of transports and shifts of transports from road to rail for example. Some logistics service providers try to gain competitive advantages by offering products with low CO 2 -emissions and they want to know if their reduction measures are effective. For these reasons logistics service providers as well as research facilities develop tools to measure the emissions of transports. The aim of this paper is to present the current state of reduction measures and tools for measuring emissions and find out which role such initiatives play in Austrian firms of the transport and logistics sector. Firstly a theoretical overview about external effects in general and CO 2 -emissions in particular is given, followed by the presentation of political instruments which could be used for the reduction of emissions caused by the transport sector. Furthermore some current developments in the sector and initiatives by single companies are shown as well as some factors influencing the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> and studies comparing the emissions of road transport and combined transport. In the third section some existing tools for measuring emissions of transports are described and compared.
