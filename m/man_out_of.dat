5|$|One of {{the scenes}} in Southeast Asia takes place near a karaoke club, and depicts groups of girls, {{apparently}} {{ranging in age from}} early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. Benjamin Nolot interviews a police officer, who says that the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a town where he was trying to purchase sex with a child.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E

The footage showed Harwood push a third <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (<b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E

Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two {{expert witnesses}} agreed that Blythe is not aggressive; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage.

25|$|Various anti-Stratfordian {{writers have}} {{interpreted}} poems by Ben Jonson, including his prefatory poem to the First Folio, as oblique references to Shakespeare's {{identity as a}} frontman for another writer. They have also identified him with such literary characters as the laughingstock Sogliardo in Jonson’s Every <b>Man</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> His Humour, the literary thief poet-ape in Jonson's poem of the same name, and the foolish poetry-lover Gullio in the university play The Return from Parnassus. Such characters are taken {{as evidence that the}} London theatrical world knew Shakespeare was a mere front for an unnamed author whose identity could not be explicitly given.|$|E
25|$|Du Shi's {{reputation}} was somewhat stymied in 38 {{when he was}} accused of having one of his retainers sent to kill a <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> vengeance for his brother. In that same year, Du became ill and died. Despite Du's long-standing official career, the Director of Retainers Bao Yong reported that no proper funeral ceremony could be arranged for Du, since Du was nearly broke when he died. However, the Emperor had an imperial edict made which granted Du a proper funeral ceremony at his commandery residence in the capital, along with silk to pay for the expenditures.|$|E

25|$|By 1601, he {{was well}} known in London {{literary}} circles, particularly {{in his role as}} enemy to the equally pugnacious Ben Jonson. Jonson, who reported to Drummond that Marston had accused him of sexual profligacy, satirized Marston in Clove in Every <b>Man</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> His Humour, as Crispinus in Poetaster, and as Hedon in Cynthia's Revels. Jonson criticised Marston for being a false poet, a vain, careless writer who plagiarised the works of others and whose own works were marked by bizarre diction and ugly neologisms. For his part, Marston may have satirized Jonson as the complacent, arrogant critic Brabant Senior in Jack Drum's Entertainment and as the envious, misanthropic playwright and satirist Lampatho Doria in What You Will.|$|E
25|$|Captain America wears {{a costume}} that bears an American flag motif, and is {{armed with a}} nearly indestructible shield that he throws at foes. The {{character}} is usually depicted as the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his time with its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.|$|E

The challengers got the advantage early on, with Luger wearing down Yokozuna by smashing Yokozuna's {{head into the}} top turnbuckle. Yokozuna accidentally fell onto Hart's foot, sparking a confrontation between the tag team partners. After a few minutes, the two settled their differences, the challengers retained the advantage {{for much of the}} match. The finish came after the Allied Powers double-teamed on Yokozuna. Following a back suplex, the referee ordered Bulldog, who wasn't the legal <b>man,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring.

The book is an autobiography and talks about Paisley's introduction to the music industry and how the events in his life helped to prepare him for what was up ahead. The book features topics such as the first guitar that his grandfather gave him, his first band the C-notes, the first song he wrote, and many more music/guitar related topics. Although the book does speak briefly of his personal life, the main focus is on his music and the start of his career.|$|E
25|$|Juan de Oñate {{intended}} on colonizing New Mexico {{starting from}} 1595. (He formally held the area by April 1598.) The Acoma warrior Zutacapan {{heard of this}} plan and warned the mesa and organized a defense. However, a pueblo elder Chumpo dissuaded war partly to prevent deaths and partly based on Zutancalpo's (Zutacapan's son) mentioning of the widespread belief that the Spaniards were immortal. Thus, when Oñate visited on October 27, 1598, Acoma met him peacefully with no resistance to Oñate's demand of surrender and obedience reported. Oñate demonstrated his military power by firing a gun salute. Zutacapan offered to meet Oñate formally in the religious kiva, which is traditionally used as the place to make sacred oaths and pledges. However, Oñate was scared of death and in suspicious ignorance of Acoma customs refused to enter via ladder from the roof into the dark kiva chambers. Purguapo was another Acoma <b>man</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four chosen for Spaniard negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare's work {{undoubtedly}} {{formed the}} great {{bulk of the}} company's repertory. In {{their first year of}} performance, they may have staged such of Shakespeare's older plays as remained in the author's possession, including Henry VI, Part 2, Henry VI, Part 3, as well as Titus Andronicus. A Midsummer Night's Dream may have been the first play Shakespeare wrote for the new company; it was followed {{over the next two years}} by a concentrated burst of creativity that resulted in Romeo and Juliet, Love's Labours Lost, The Merchant of Venice, and the plays in the so-called second tetralogy. The extent and nature of the non-Shakespearean repertory in the first is not known; plays such as Locrine, The Troublesome Reign of King John, and Christopher Marlowe's Edward II have somewhat cautiously been advanced as likely candidates. The earliest non-Shakespearean play known to have been performed by the company is Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour, which was produced in the middle of 1598; they also staged the thematic sequel, Every <b>Man</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> His Humour, the next year.|$|E
