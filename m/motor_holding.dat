25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the <b>motor.</b> <b>Holding</b> it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piëch, a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984.

Introduction: With the growing electrical industry there is an increasing demand for convenient, efficient and practical mans of utilizing electrical energy. The combined efforts of the designer and manufacturer have produced an electric motor to suit the various demands made upon it. The direct current and synchronous <b>motors</b> still <b>hold</b> their respective places in the conversion of electrical into mechanical energy. While these <b>motors</b> <b>hold</b> a place which, perhaps no other <b>motor</b> can <b>hold,</b> {{they are at the}} same time found unsatisfactory in many modern requirements. The question might justly be asked why these motors do not fill all the requirements of an electric motor, why is the induction motor coming into use and what are its advantages? Probably a strong point in favor of the induction motor is its adaptability to the present use of alternating current; however the synchronous motor with its characteristic faults also holds a place in this field. The shunt and series motor might also be used on alternating current; however the shunt motor has the objection that in the armature the current is in phase with the E. M. F. while the high inductance in the fields gives the current- in them about 90 degrees lag, thus throwing the armature current and field current out of phase with each other. To overcome this objection the field may be excited from a separate E. M. F. differing in phases 90 degrees from that supplied to the armature. A quarter phase machine would do this, one phase furnishing current for the armature while the other supplied the field, but this would load the two phase...|$|R

The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start <b>motor</b> <b>holds</b> one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|R
