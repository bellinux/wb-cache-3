40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we compare the {{settling}} flux of a cohesive sediment mixture measured in a quiescent fluid with that achieved in a turbulent flow. Experiments were {{performed in a}} mixing tank. The turbulence produced mechanically by an oscillating grid maintains a stationary, highly concentrated fluid mud layer in which the concentration is almost uniform. In this layer the turbulence decay with increasing distance from the grid {{is similar to that}} obtained in clear water. For steady conditions the settling flux of the fluid <b>mud</b> mixture is <b>balanced</b> by the upward turbulent flux, and its value can be determined from the measured depth of the fluid mud layer. At high concentrations (10 – 200 g L− 1), we show that the settling flux in a turbulent fluid is much larger than estimated in a quiescent fluid (up to two orders of magnitude). Hindering effects in the settling process of cohesive sediments may thus be considerably reduced by turbulence...|$|R

For some patients Felke prescribed different diets, {{depending on their}} diagnoses.In 1992, a barefoot walk that was inspired by Felke's ideas was created in Bad Sobernheim. This 3.5 km loop has different stations, such as natural stones, gravel, wood, <b>mud</b> pools, water, <b>balancing</b> stations and grassy areas, to activate the senses, the foot's reflex zones, and the musculoskeletal system.There are still a number of Felke societies today. Bad Sobernheim {{continues to be a}} center of Felke cures with three health resorts, with another one in Diez on the Lahn and one in Meddersheim (close to Bad Sobernheim). Both clay cures and iridology have become an established part of the practice of naturopathy in the early 21st century. The Felke Institute for Iridology was established in 1984. There is also a Medical Working Group for Felke Therapy with offices in Bad Sobernheim and a manufacturer of combination homeopathic remedies, Hevert-Arzneimittel GmbH & Co.

40|$|Drilling of {{petroleum}} wells have traditionally {{be done by}} adjusting the <b>mud</b> weight to <b>balance</b> pressure of the well. A new method of controlling well pressure is called controlled mud cap drilling. The method uses high mud weight and constantly changing the mud height to adjust the bottom hole pressure. This allows for drilling wells which previously were considered un-drillable. Drilling of wells might be done by a floating drilling vessel, which might drift off. In such cases an emergency disconnect of riser may be unavoidable. Hence the riser must be disconnected. The top tension is set high enough to lift the riser and LMRP clear of the BOP with a set mud height. This top tension creates recoil in the riser. During drilling the mud height changes constantly while the top tension remains constant. In essence the top tension is relatively large if disconnecting with low mud level, hence recoil would be larger. In order to look into this issue of riser response with different mud heights a model {{has been established in}} Riflex. This has been modeled with weight on an accurate modeling of the riser and heave compensation system while the LMRP has been simplified. The mud in the riser has been modeled with three different mud heights, 80 m, 150 m and 200 m above the seabed. During disconnect the mud can either stay in the riser (annular preventer closed) or it can fall out (open annular preventer), both of these cases have been modeled. The drilling vessel is usually not positioned directly above the BOP when an emergency disconnect is implemented. Therefore a horizontal offset of 5 % of water depth was set. The study case is the Åsgard field on Norwegian Continental Shelf which has a water depth of 350 meters, hence the offset is set to be 17. 5 meters. There will be an unbalance in forces at the moment the riser disconnects. A tension wave and a mud pressure wave will travel up the riser. These waves travel up the riser induces an upward motion on the riser and a fall in axial stress. The magnitude of the fall in axial stress is highly dependent on the mud height at the moment of release. The drop in axial is greater for low mud heights and decreasing with increasing mud height. The fall might be so large that compression of the riser can occur. The risk of compression is greatest {{at the bottom of the}} riser. Maximum bending stresses as a response to disconnect may not be at the moment of release. There might be a delay in the maximum response. These bending stresses are not large enough in themselves to impose any structural issues on the riser. There will be no issues unless a peak value in bending stresses and a fall in axial stresses coincide. This might occur at the bottom of the riser. For low mud levels the riser might experience axial compression combined with relatively high bending stresses. This combination may result in local buckling, however, this is subject for further work. The responses are in general slightly larger when the drilling vessel has no offset. In order to avoid extreme response of the riser it is advisable to increase the amount of mud. It may be useful to determine an optimal mud level where the responses to release are low. A part of the emergency disconnect sequence might be to fill the riser either with water or mud in order to come close to the optimal release mud height before release. It is very important that the mud level is low enough too able the riser to lift clear the BOP. It is more expectable to have damage to the riser or drilling vessel compared to the BOP. </p...|$|R

40|$|For a {{sustained}} management of a man-made estuary like the Scheldt estuary {{knowledge of the}} behaviour of fine sediments and the <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> is necessary because fine sediments determine habitats, provide food for organisms, transport contaminants, determine the pollution status of the bottom sediments and influence the access from the shipping channel to the harbour (docks). The determination and the monitoring of the <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> of an estuary is however difficult to accomplish especially when anthropogenic influences are profound like in the Scheldt estuary. For some elements of the <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> of the Scheldt estuary quite a lot knowledge has been obtained the last decade. The following elements of the <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> will be discussed. 1. The occurrence of mud in the estuary. Mud occurs on the tidal flats near the salt marsh (mud flats), in harbours with a free opening to the river, and also, in the high turbidity zone of the Beneden ZeeScheldt (middle estuary) in the river channel. The sediments {{in this area are}} sandy muds and differ from the mud in the access channels mainly by the amount of sand. 2. The supply of fluvial mud to the estuary. This supply has been estimated with some degree of precision for the last 10 years. It decreased from 1992 till 1996 from 250 ktons to 95 ktons and from then on increased again to 350 ktons. 3. The evolution of the quantities (stock) of mud in the bottom sediments in the Beneden ZeeScheldt. With bottom maps, compiled by several authors between 1963 and 1999, the change in mud volume in the bottom sediments in the Beneden ZeeScheldt can be evaluated. Between 1964 and 1986 the mud volume increased with 2 % per year. Between 1986 - 1999 a further increase of 0. 7 % per year, is observed. Most of this “new and polluted” mud has sedimented in the access channels to the sluices of Zandvliet, Berendrecht and Kallo and is removed from 1993 onwards, especially from the access to the Kallo sluice by a large scale operation. The 2. 8 million tons of sediments removed are dumpted in a harbour dock on the left bank. From the data it can be concluded that during the post- 1986 period the mud supply to the river bed has been reduced by approximately 50 % compared to the previous period...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{drilling}} and well completion operations, drilling fluid {{is a crucial}} element as it is employed {{for the purposes of}} several functions. The main functions of drilling fluid are to control formation pressure, maintain the wellbore stability, transport the cuttings up to surface to clean the borehole bottom as well as to lubricate and cool the drill bit. Moreover, it is used to minimize the drilling damage to reservoir and suspend cuttings when the pumping is stop, hence it will not falling back down the borehole. The {{purpose of this study is}} to formulate new drilling mud formulation modified with nanosilica. Six samples of water based mud (WBM) were prepared using three types of polymers, (Xanthan Gum, Hydro Zan Plus and Hydro Star HT), starch and nanosilica. Basic rheological tests such as density, viscosity and pH were carried out. The density test was carried out using <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> meanwhile the pH test was using pH meter.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{requires the}} quantification of human impacts, against the seafloor’s ecological value. Recent impact {{studies have shown}} only localised effects, though indications of a longer-term and broader-scale degradation of the seafloor exist. This is due possibly to cumulative anthropogenically-induced effects, but the natural evolution and {{the response of the}} seafloor due to sea-level rise are poorly known. Nonetheless, it is likely that changing wave climate and an increased storminess induce different erosion/sedimentation patterns. Such evolution needs to be evaluated against the impact of dredging, aggregate extraction, fisheries and beach replenishment on the ecosystem’s physical functioning. The research proposal will focus on the sand and <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> of the Belgian shelf, coupled to the Schelde Estuary and the coastal zone. The methodology will consist of: advanced modelling, validated with experiments; targeted observations/samplings, within the space, depth and time domain (4 D); and various long-term datasets. Predictions will be made using different sea-level rise scenarios. The quantification of erosion/sedimentation processes is important for: the development of criteria for a sustainable exploitation/management and sustainable coastal protection schemes; allocating efficient dumping grounds; understanding coastal habitat change; and the prediction of sources/sinks of pollutants.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} tests {{have been conducted}} to assess the suitability of using dolomite as an alternative weighting agent in drilling fluids. Currently, barite is widely used as weighting agent in drilling fluids slurry to ensure proper weights are achieved. However, barite contains toxic materials which make it unattractive from health and environment point of views. This is especially true when drilling operations are offshore, {{where most of the}} used drilling fluids will be dumped back into the sea. In this work, rheological properties of dolomite blend drilling fluids slurry were studied. Dolomite rocks were first crushed to produce dolomite powder, before being mixed with water and bentonite at various proportions. A total of 10 samples which contains various percentages of water, bentonite and dolomite were studied. For each sample, its rheological properties were determined. Such properties include density from <b>mud</b> <b>balance,</b> viscosity from viscometer, filtrate loss from API filter press and gel strength. The effect of aging on the properties of drilling fluids was also studied. From the study, it is concluded that Sample E, which consists of 70 % dolomite by weight, produces the most stable drilling fluids.

Excess fluid loss due to degradation of additives of drilling fluids causes {{a major problem in}} real-time drilling. Usages of excess biocides are threat to the environment and cause handling problems. Effect of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, a cationic surfactant, on rheology, fluid loss and biocide has been studied in a polymer-based drilling fluid. Inhibitive polymer mud was formulated using XC polymer, shale inhibitors like KCl, K 2 SO 4 and CaCO 3 as bridging agent. Rheology and other properties were studied using Fann VG meter, API filter press, <b>mud</b> <b>balance,</b> roller oven apparatus. Dissolved oxygen meter was used to check the microbicidal property of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide. Addition of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide increased fluid retention capacity of the fluid even at very low concentration 0.1 %(w/v) without affecting the mud properties. Also it is compatible with the commercially available fluid loss preventers like pre-gelatinized starch when used in combination. It also performed well in dissolved oxygen test, suggesting eliminating need of any other biocide to prevent degradation of bio-polymer-based drilling fluid. The dissolved oxygen test results are comparable with commercial available biocides. Thermal stability studies were carried out by using roller oven at different temperatures. It was found suitable for application in high-concentrated brine conditions and at high temperatures up to 120  °C without effecting the rheology and shear thinning property of the fluid. Bridging efficiency was investigated by analysing the mud cake using scanning electron microscope.|$|E
40|$|Interactions between {{physical}} and biological processes in intertidal sediments {{have been the}} focus of studies in the framework of the ECOFLAT project. Process studies were focused on the Molenplaat, a 1. 5 km 2 intertidal flat in the Westerschelde estuary, The Netherlands. Distinct spatial patterns in the biological community on the flat were found and related to patterns in bottom shear stress as derived from a hydrodynamic model. Based on these survey results five stations were selected with contrasting sediment composition and benthic communities. Long-term net sedimentation of mainly sand was deduced from radionuclide profiles. Sedimentation of mud on the surface of part of the intertidal flat was shown to be a seasonally cyclic process, with a magnitude sufficient to significantly affect the <b>mud</b> <b>balance</b> of the estuary. Measurements of erodability as a function of tidal current showed a biological control on this variable. Benthic microalgae stabilise the sediment surface, whereas the benthic macrofauna has a destabilising effect. Food web studies show that the contrasting biological communities (microbenthos, meiobenthos, macrobenthos) at muddy and sandy sites have substantial differences in the quantitative aspects of their food web. Turnover of microalgae is much lower at muddy than at sandy sites, and this is mostly related to a lower grazing pressure. It is hypothesised that high mud content decreases the availability of benthic microalgae to grazers. We demonstrate a positive feedback between benthic microalgae and mud sedimentation which may lead to the existence of different stable states. This may explain the existence of relatively sharp boundaries and strong community contrasts in the presence of weak and smooth environmental gradients...|$|E
