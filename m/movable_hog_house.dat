The materials used had best be easily obtained, thus avoiding a “special order” with its probable difficulties. 2. Convenience: It had best be so arranged as to require the least time and labor of attention; it should be easy to fill, to clean and to adjust.

40|$|<b>Movable</b> <b>hog</b> <b>houses,</b> {{properly}} {{built and}} used, are successful. Those {{described in this}} bulletin have stood the test at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station. They are practical and satisfactory and what is said concerning them and <b>hog</b> <b>houses</b> in general is based on years of thorough investigation and study of the housing of swine by the animal husbandry and agricultural engineering sections. Proper housing is essential to successful swine production, {{and yet it is}} ofttimes overlooked. Dry, sanitary, comfortable conditions must be provided if one wishes the best returns in the pork producing business. The hog is not as well protected with natural covering as most domestic animals. He relies mainly on the production of thick layers of fat which provide considerable protection. All hogs are not so fortunate, however, as to be fat, hence they must depend upon their hair or bristle covering which is inadequate, even though abundant, in the zero days of winter. Sensible shelter, therefore, is in order because it saves feed, provides comfort, and, of course, saves money...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{housing is}} {{essential}} in profitable swine production. The largest financial returns are obtained only when dry, sanitary, comfortable and convenient housing conditions are provided. It {{is a mistake to}} think the hog {{does not need to be}} protected from the weather. Having been originally a native of comparatively warm climates, nature has not provided the hog with much in the way of protective covering. It is true it has layers of fat, when it is fat, which offer protection but there is not the thick coat of hair or wool with which other farm animals are provided. Again, it is recognized that the best way to guard against the ravages of disease is to provide sanitary conditions. These considerations, together with the possibility of saving much labor in a well planned house over a poorly planned one, is the occasion for giving much thought and study to the problem of housing swine. For several years, the Agricultural Engineering and Animal Husbandry sections of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station have been making a careful investigation of the design and construction of <b>hog</b> <b>houses.</b> Bulletin 152, published in October, 1914, in addition to setting forth the essentials of an ideal <b>hog</b> <b>house</b> and discussing quite fully the relative. merits of the movable and consolidated or community types, described in detail the construction of several types of <b>movable</b> <b>hog</b> <b>houses</b> which had been thoroly tried out at the station.

40|$|We report {{here the}} development, validation, {{and use of}} three {{real-time}} PCR assays to quantify the abundance of the following three groups of tetracycline resistance genes: tet(A) and tet(C); tet(G); and tet genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins, including tet(M), tet(O), tetB(P), tet(Q), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(W). The assays were validated using known numbers of sample-derived tet gene templates added to microbiome DNA. These assays are both precise and accurate over at least 6 log tet gene copies. New tet gene variants were also identified from cloned tet amplicons {{as part of this}} study. The utility of these real-time PCR assays was demonstrated by quantifying the three tet gene groups present in bovine and swine manures, composts of swine manure, lagoons of <b>hog</b> <b>house</b> effluent, and samples from an Ekokan upflow biofilter system treating <b>hog</b> <b>house</b> effluent. The bovine manures were found to contain fewer copies of all three groups of tet genes than the swine manures. The composts of swine manures had substantially reduced tet gene abundance (up to 6 log), while lagoon storage or the upflow biofilter had little effect on tet gene abundance. These results suggest that the method of manure storage and treatment may have a substantial impact on the persistence and dissemination of tet genes in agricultural environments. These real-time PCR assays provide rapid, quantitative, cultivation-independent measurements of 10 major classes of tet genes, which should be useful for ecological studies of antibiotic resistance...|$|R
