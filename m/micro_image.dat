30|$|An image {{defocusing}} {{technique has}} been used in Defocusing Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DDPIV) for 3 D particle tracking and 3 D flow measurement [5, 6]. This imaging technique has been extended to microflow applications such as the <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> defocusing technique [7.8. 9.10]. Within this field, several authors have described the effects of fluid RI in the image defocusing for the purpose of z-compensation for fluid RIs when using (μ−) DDPIV [6, 9, 10]. It is therefore plausible that the image defocusing technique might be applied to the measurement of RI using a simple optical layout. A micro-refractometer that used <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> defocusing and a microfluidic device was reported previously [11] but the authors gave no details of its optical configuration; however, they demonstrated the use of the image defocusing technique for RI measurement.|$|E

40|$|Color filters {{based upon}} nanostructured metals have {{garnered}} significant interest in recent years, having been positioned as {{alternatives to the}} organic dye-based filters which provide color selectivity in image sensors, as nonfading “printing” technologies for producing images with nanometer pixel resolution, and as ultra-high-resolution, small foot-print optical storage and encoding solutions. Here, we demonstrate a plasmonic filter set with polarization-switchable color properties, based upon arrays of asymmetric cross-shaped nanoapertures in an aluminum thin-film. Acting as individual color-emitting nanopixels, the plasmonic cavity-apertures have dual-color selectivity, transmitting one of two visible colors, controlled by the polarization of the white light incident on {{the rear of the}} pixel and tuned by varying the critical dimensions of the geometry and periodicity of the array.

A new technique for TV image tracking; advanced predicted window technique (APWT), is proposed. In this technique the tracking window is positioned at an advanced (predicted) position of the target moving center in a noisy background. In addition, the advanced positive frame difference predicted window technique (APFDWT) is presented, and its mathematical formulation (including separation of moving target from noisy background, extraction of dominant features of moving target, and selection of target to be tracked) is derived. The proposed system has the ability to identify and track close distinct targets flying in noisy stationary ambient-ground. The evaluation of target center, orientation angle, and velocity parameters are introduced to improve the tracking process The proposed system overcomes most of the disadvantages of the traditional TV tracking systems such as: initial manual location of the window around the selected target, initial adjustment of the window, Size, tracking failure due to the movement of other targets across the window, and the increased processing time due to the use of <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> processors in case of multi-target tracking.

The most frequent open fracture type is short stylolite-related fractures (F 1), but longer open fractures are also present, with no obvious relationship to stylolites (F 2). The F 1 fracture densities are related generally to the clay {{content of the}} host rock, which controls the occurrence and spacing of the stylolites. The fractures are steep, with a N–S-dominant strike azimuth and significant spread. Although, generally, the F 1 fractures are short, a percolating and 3 D connected open fracture network across the core was found {{in most of the}} CT-scan samples. Open fractures were also found in the damage zone of a lately reactivated fault. The formation of the open fractures in the Snøhvit Field is related most likely to thermoelastic processes during removal of overburden in late Tertiary time.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 In recent years, {{miniature}} scanner technologies, including {{micro-electro-mechanical system}} (MEMS) scanners, {{have started to}} appear on the market. Most miniature scanner technologies utilize MEMS scanner mirrors. However, this approach has many limitations. In the meanwhile, a competing technology called fiber optic resonant scanner (FORS) has also been developed in order to obtain forward image. An off-the-shelf piezoelectric actuator at the base to create transverse vibrations of a resonating optical fiber has shown to be an effective method for generating 1 D and 2 D laser line scans. We previously developed a 2 D <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> display device that utilized MEMS-based waveguide to replace the optical fiber, which can potentially overcome the size limitations of mirror-based display. In this research, an improved waveguide scanner system using a fully integrated MEMS-based push-pull actuator is presented. This prototype features monolithic integration of the waveguide, actuator, and light source, and removes the dependence on external actuators used by the previous design. The transmission efficiency is low and cantilever is slightly under tensile stress due to inherent imperfection in the process imperfection and tooling in fabrication.

40|$|Computational anatomy {{allows the}} {{quantitative}} analysis of organs in medical images. However, most analysis is constrained to the millimeter scale {{because of the}} limited resolution of clinical computed tomography (CT). X-ray microtomography (μCT) {{on the other hand}} allows imaging of ex-vivo tissues at a resolution of tens of microns. In this work, we use clinical CT to image lung cancer patients before partial pneumonectomy (resection of pathological lung tissue). The resected specimen is prepared for μCT imaging at a voxel resolution of 50 μm (0. 05 mm). This high-resolution image of the lung cancer tissue allows further insides into understanding of tumor growth and categorization. For making full use of this additional information, image fusion (registration) needs to be performed in order to re-align the μCT image with clinical CT. We developed a multi-scale non-rigid registration approach. After manual initialization using a few landmark points and rigid alignment, several levels of non-rigid registration between down-sampled (in the case of μCT) and up-sampled (in the case of clinical CT) representations of the image are performed. Any non-lung tissue is ignored during the computation of the similarity measure used to guide the registration during optimization. We are able to recover the volume differences introduced by the resection and preparation of the lung specimen. The average (± std. dev.) minimum surface distance between μCT and clinical CT at the resected lung surface is reduced from 3. 3 ± 2. 9 (range: [0. 1, 15. 9]) to 2. 3 mm ± 2. 8 (range: [0. 0, 15. 3]) mm. The alignment of clinical CT with μCT will allow further registration with even finer resolutions of μCT (up to 10 μm resolution) and ultimately with histopathological microscopy images for further macro to <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> fusion that can aid medical image analysis.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of sensor-enabled smartphones, significant attention has been attracted to develop sensing-driven mobile systems. Current research on sensing-driven mobile systems can be classified into two categories, based on the purpose of sensing. In the first category, smartphones are used to sense personal context information, such as locations, activities, and daily habits to enable applications such as location-aware systems and virtual reality systems. In the second category, smartphones are exploited to collect sensing data {{of the physical world}} and enable applications including traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and others. ^ As smartphones become blossomed in popularity and ubiquity, new problems have emerged in both categories of mobile sensing systems. In this thesis, we investigate three core challenges by answering the following fundamental questions: first, how can we utilize user context to improve the operating system performance? Second, how can we process sensing data, especially images, with high accuracy? Third, how can we enable distributed sensing while satisfy resource constraints of smartphones? ^ The first part of this thesis studies how to exploit user context to improve the responsiveness of mobile operating systems. We propose a context-aware application-preloading engine named FALCON. The core of FALCON is a decision engine that learns application usage patterns of mobile users and preloads applications ahead of time to improve the responsiveness of mobile OS. Compared with other approaches such as caching schemes like Least Recently Used (LRU), Falcon improves the application responsiveness by two times. ^ The second part of this thesis focuses on image search for mobile phones. We first explore how to improve image search accuracy on centralized servers, and propose an image search engine named CrowdSearch. The core idea of CrowdSearch is to incorporate crowdsourced human validation into the system for removing erroneous results from automated image search engines, while still provide realtime response for mobile users. Compared with existing automated image search engines, CrowdSearch achieves over 95 % accuracy consistently across multiple categories of images with response time in a minute. ^ We then extend image search to distributed mobile phones, and emphasis resource constraint problems, especially on energy and bandwidth. We propose a distributed image search system named SenSearch, which turns smartphones into <b>micro</b> <b>image</b> search engines. Images are collected, indexed, and transmitted using compact features that are two magnitudes smaller than their raw format. SenSearch improves the energy and bandwidth cost by five times compared with centralized image search engines. ...|$|E
