5|$|The Kingdom Hearts {{series has}} been {{critically}} and commercially successful. As of March 2014, the series has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The three main {{games in the}} series all met with positive sales {{at the time of}} their releases. In the first two <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> North American release of Kingdom Hearts, it was one of the top three highest-selling video games. Chain of Memories sold 104,000 units in 48 hours in Japan, a record for a Game Boy Advance title at the time. Its positive debut sales placed it in the top spot of sales charts in Japan. In the first month of its North American release, it was ranked 1st on GameSpot's ChartSpot for portable systems and 6th for all consoles. Within three days of the Kingdom Hearts II release in Japan, it shipped 1 million copies, selling through within a month. By the end of March 2006, the NPD Group reported that Kingdom Hearts II was the highest-selling console game in North America, with 614,000 copies. In the month after its release in North America, Kingdom Hearts II sold an estimated 1 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy transported the {{division}} to Tobruk from 19September to 25October, in a politically controversial move {{to relieve the}} mainly Australian garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven <b>months,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Siege of Tobruk. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, {{the division}} defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against German and Italian positions. On 18November, the British Eighth Army launched Operation Crusader. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following {{the destruction of the}} Axis armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of the Axis tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26November saw the division link up with the approaching New Zealand Division, cutting the Axis lines of communication. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to throw back the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; the Axis forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men—from units attached to the division—were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during Operation Crusader.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, {{marching to}} the beat of drums, “took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> March {{earthquake}} and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant”. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.|$|E

The host's immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different antibodies (IgM and IgG).|$|E

25|$|The Coalition {{government}} panicked, {{fearing a}} possible threat to order {{or even a}} Bolshevik-style insurrection. It was only fourteen <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Russian Revolution, and the German Revolution was still in progress in January 1919. Troops based in the city's Maryhill barracks were locked inside their post, with troops and tanks from elsewhere being sent into the city to control unrest and extinguish any revolution that should break out. No Glaswegian troops were deployed, and few veterans, with the government fearing that fellow Glaswegians might sympathise with the strikers if a revolutionary situation developed in Glasgow. Young, mostly untried, troops were transported from camps and barracks {{around the country and}} stationed on the streets of Glasgow, specifically to combat this possibility.|$|E

25|$|On 2 December 1939, {{nearly three}} <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, he rejoined the KSLI as a corporal. He was, however, quickly promoted to Company sergeant major and within five months of joining was the Regimental sergeant major of the battalion. Offered the opportunity of a commission he went to 166th Officer Cadet Training Unit in mid-1940. On graduation he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox & Bucks) on 9 November 1940. He rose to captain commanding a company for over a year. When the battalion was marked for conversion to airborne in early 1942, Howard volunteered, accepting demotion to 2nd lieutenant and command of a platoon. He was subsequently promoted, becoming a major in May 1942 and became company commander of 'D' Company which he trained {{for the next two}} years.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 1793, Barlow took Childers into Brest to reconnoitre {{the port}} {{due to the}} growing hostility between Britain and the First French Republic. Tensions had been {{mounting}} for <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution {{and the opening of}} the French Revolutionary Wars the previous year between France, Prussia, Austria and Sardinia but Britain and France were not yet at war when Barlow entered Brest. Within minutes of his arrival, one of the formidable forts overlooking the harbour mouth opened fire on his diminutive craft with 48lb shot. One of the first balls fired struck a gun on Childers deck and split the cannon in two. Barlow beat a hasty retreat without suffering any casualties and reported the attack to his superiors. One month later Britain and France were at war; in his excursion to Brest, Barlow had received the first shots of a 23-year conflict.|$|E

25|$|In October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (who {{had only}} been in power for 12 <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{resignation}} of Harold Macmillan) called a general election. It was a tough election, but Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats (a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304). The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems and Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new government {{had to cope with}} a balance of payments deficit and speculative attacks on Sterling. It was the policy of the whole government, and one in which Callaghan concurred, that devaluation should be avoided {{for as long as possible}} and he managed to arrange loans from other central banks and some tax rises to stabilise the economy. Callaghan's time as chancellor was to be during a time of crisis; with high inflation, high unemployment and an unstable economy with a deficit in the budget, a deficit in the balance of import and exports and most importantly conflict over the value of the pound.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 1953, the low-lying {{areas of}} Thurrock were {{inundated}} by the North Sea flood of 1953. The Van den Berghs and Jurgens margarine factory, which manufactured Stork margarine, {{was forced to}} stop production for many <b>months.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> output of this factory constituted {{one third of the}} country's ration allocation, this led to a severe strain on the supply of margarine in the UK. Most schools in Thurrock were closed, either {{as a direct result of}} the flooding or in order to use them to help the relief effort. More than 1300 people in Tilbury and other low-lying areas were evacuated to schools on the higher ground. Chadwell St Mary Primary school was used as the main welfare centre for the homeless. By 15 February, most schools had returned to normal. The last to resume were the Landsdowne school in Tilbury and the newly opened Woodside Primary School - then called Tyrell Heath School. On Friday 13 February, the flooded areas were visited by the young Queen Elizabeth II Despite severe loss of life in nearby Canvey Island, only one person in Thurrock died as a result of the floods.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR {{recommended}} that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral {{of the situation in}} the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that – more than 18 <b>months</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council.|$|E
