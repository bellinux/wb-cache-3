5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the <b>main</b> <b>contract</b> started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E

500|$|A {{collateral}} {{contract is}} a contract where the consideration is the entry into another subordinate contract, which co-exists {{side by side}} with the <b>main</b> <b>contract.</b> Because this normally involves parties who are not part of the <b>main</b> <b>contract,</b> it has been used as a way around the doctrine of privity.

2500|$|In 1784, the Stourbridge and Dudley {{companies}} {{approached the}} Birmingham Canal about a junction. This would involve building extra locks at Park Head, and a tunnel which would link to Lord Dudley's existing mining tunnel, which joined the Birmingham Canal at Tipton. The Birmingham company agreed, but imposed heavy tolls on traffic using the junction, {{to compensate for}} the loss of revenue of goods which would formerly have travelled via Aldersely Junction. Lord Dudley agreed to sell his tunnel to the Dudley Canal Company, but never received any payment, as the beneficial tolls and usefulness of the new canal were deemed to be adequate compensation. An Act of Parliament was obtained in July 1785 to authorise the work, which had been surveyed by John Snape and John Bull, and checked by Dadford, who then became consulting engineer. Abraham Lees was the on-site engineering manager, and the <b>main</b> <b>contract</b> for the tunnel went to John Pinkerton. Its width was to be , with [...] of headroom and [...] of water. The contract specified that it should be finished by 25 March 1788. In 1787, Pinkerton's work was thought to be unsatisfactory, and work stopped while arguments took place. Dadford was paid off, Pinkerton had to pay half of his £4,000 bond, and work restarted with Isaac Pratt in charge. He was a member of both the Stourbridge and the Dudley committees. Lees retained his position.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Best {{starting}} on the <b>main</b> <b>contract,</b> Holme and King had been awarded a contract in April 1902 {{to build a}} road from Lofthouse to Angram. Bradford had purchased enough land to allow the light railway to be built beside the road, and although Best was awarded a contact for the railway in 1903, it appears that Holme and King built a [...] gauge contractor's railway beside part {{or all of the}} road. They had two locomotives on site, both 0-4-0 saddle tanks, one bought second hand some years earlier and moved to the site in spring 1902, after working on several other projects, and the second bought new for delivery to Pateley Bridge. By mid-1904, there was a [...] line from Angram, which crossed the River Nidd on a [...] bridge just before it reached Lofthouse. Best began extending the line towards Pateley Bridge, and by 13 July 1904, it had reached a level crossing at Sykes Bank, [...] below Lofthouse, and work had commenced at several other sites. On that date, a party of 150 members of Bradford City Council, with invited guests, arrived by train at Pateley Bridge, and were transported to Gouthwaite Dam in carriages. Here there was a ceremony in which the Lord Major cut the first sod for the Nidd Valley Light Railway. The party then proceeded to Sykes Bank, where a train was waiting, which consisted of 15 wagons fitted with makeshift seats, and two locomotives, one of which was Holme and King's Xit and the other was Best's Angram. It took about an hour to reach Angram, where there were presentations, and Alderman Holdsworth cut the first sod for the dam. Refreshments were then served and the party returned to Lofthouse by train and to Pateley Bridge by carriage.|$|E
