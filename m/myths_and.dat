5000|$|In {{traditional}} societies, <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> ritual are two central {{components of}} religious practice. Although <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> ritual are commonly united {{as parts of}} religion, the exact relationship between them has {{been a matter of}} controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is [...] "the <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory," [...] held notably by the so-called Cambridge Ritualists, which holds that [...] "myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual." [...] This theory is still disputed; many scholars now believe that <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> ritual share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.|$|R

40|$|<b>Myth</b> <b>and</b> {{narrative}} {{are taken}} as self-apparent and universal tools {{of personal and}} social interests’ justification, that are ingrained deeply in our cognitive structures. In this article, the <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> narrative are analyzed as the features of human psycholinguistic structures, aiding the creation of variety of meanings that affects the everyday mass consciousness. Modern myths differ from the classical ones, due to their genesis and clear pragmatics, framed for a particular social group. This unites modern mythology with the ideology. Narrative becomes {{the way of the}} last maintenance, turning the plot of various events into yet another mythological subject. Therefore, the article presents the process of narrative’s genesis from the myth; the common and distinctive features of <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> narrative are compared. They have such common features as metaphoricity, symbolism, imagery. <b>Myth</b> <b>and</b> narrative are based on the metaphorical theory of truth. Instead of searching the truth, their main function becomes the creation of meanings through the interpretation and representation. The differences between the classical <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> narrative are also analyzed in the article (tabulated), which are stipulated mainly due to the different time perception - cyclic for a <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> linear for narrative. The article also shows the features, distinguishing the modern political myth from the traditional classical...|$|R

5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
