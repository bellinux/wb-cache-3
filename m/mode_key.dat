40|$|Abstract. Control {{panels of}} {{computer}} and other modern instruments are often equipped with so-called <b>mode</b> <b>keys,</b> the pressing of which changes {{the function of}} other control elements. Thus user keys have different functions depending on the current mode of the instrument. The question is, however, whether it is more userfriendly to have a panel with parallel arranged keys for each function (thus with almost direct possibility to intervene), or to have serial equipment {{with only a few}} user keys, where the different functions are only available if the user calls up the relevant machine mode (e. g. displayed on a monitor that operates with different switchable screens). In this case there exist only serial access possibilities. Two experiments compared perfor-mances with three types of user interfaces with and without <b>mode</b> <b>keys</b> on the basis of selection times and errors. Although <b>mode</b> <b>keys</b> apparently reduce the complexity of the user interface, our results show that they lead to slower and more often incorrect usage. However, the amount of practice was a moderator variable. As a consequence, for occasional users it is worth considering a less complex interface, that is, with <b>mode</b> <b>keys,</b> but for expert users an interface where each function has its own key should be preferred. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{keyboards}} have a <b>mode</b> <b>key</b> {{to switch}} between {{different forms of}} writing. This of course would only be the case on keyboards that contain more than one set of Japanese symbols. Hiragana, katakana, halfwidth katakana, halfwidth Roman letters, and fullwidth Roman letters {{are some of the}} options. A typical Japanese character is square while Roman characters are typically variable in width. Since all Japanese characters occupy the space of a square box, it is sometimes desirable to input Roman characters in the same square form in order to preserve the grid layout of the text. These Roman characters that have been fitted to a square character cell are called fullwidth, while the normal ones are called halfwidth. In some fonts these are fitted to half-squares, like some monospaced fonts, while in others they are not. Often, fonts are available in two variants, one with the halfwidth characters monospaced, and another one with proportional halfwidth characters. The name of the typeface with proportional halfwidth characters is often prefixed with [...] "P" [...] for [...] "proportional".|$|E

For two-dimensional structures, we establish sufficient conditions, involving structural symmetry, under which these anomalies attain total transmission and total reflection at frequencies separated by an arbitrarily small amount. The loci of total reflection and total transmission are real-analytic curves in frequency-wavenumber space that intersect quadratically at a single point corresponding to the guided mode. A single anomaly or multiple anomalies can be excited by the interaction with a single guided <b>mode.</b> <b>Key</b> words: periodic slab, scattering, guided mode, transmission resonance, total reflection. ...|$|E
