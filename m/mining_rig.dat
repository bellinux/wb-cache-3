5000|$|At {{the start}} of the game, players are given between two and four units {{depending}} on a dice roll. Units are produced at a mine, represented as a solid square of colour and named for that colour (e.g. Bluebell Mine or Diamond Mine). A further unit is produced each time the player rolls a one or a six; this can be increased to three units should the player purchase an additional <b>mining</b> <b>rig</b> (or [...] "working").|$|E
5000|$|The Sontaran homeworld was {{destroyed}} in the future during {{the events of the}} Seventh Doctor strip Pureblood (DWM #193-196) but the Sontaran race pool survived, allowing for further cloning; the strip introduced the concept of [...] "pureblood" [...] Sontarans not born of cloning. The Sontarans also feature in the Kroton solo strip Unnatural Born Killers (DWM #277) and the Tenth Doctor's comic strip debut The Betrothal of Sontar (DWM #365-#368), by John Tomlinson and Nick Abadzis, where a Sontaran <b>mining</b> <b>rig</b> on the ice planet Serac comes under attack by a mysterious force.|$|E
500|$|An in-browser flash social {{strategy}} game entitled Star Trek: New Vulcan Reborn {{was made}} by Harkable to promote the game. It was set on New Vulcan with the player helping to develop the planet by [...] "building landing pads, founding water treatment centres, establishing <b>mining</b> <b>rigs</b> and more." [...] An IGN competition took place where players with the most points could win prizes. The game is no longer available to play.|$|R
5000|$|Computing {{power is}} often bundled {{together}} or [...] "pooled" [...] to reduce variance in miner income. Individual <b>mining</b> <b>rigs</b> {{often have to}} wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. In a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. This payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block.|$|R
50|$|The Burst Asset Exchange is a {{peer-to-peer}} exchange platform {{integrated into the}} Burst Wallet. It functions primarily as a secure decentralized trading platform for Burst Assets. The popularity of the asset exchange {{is based upon the}} absence of any third party, allowing improved efficiency and reduced costs. A burst asset is basically a token to represent anything the asset issuer deems to be of value {{so that it can be}} traded, common examples of such assets include shares in the following: mining pools, retirement funds, crypto <b>mining</b> <b>rigs,</b> crypto gambling sites and silver investments.|$|R

50|$|The six {{resources}} in The Entente are food, wood, iron, gold, oil and electricity. The {{resources in}} the list can be gathered by workers working in farms, sawmills, iron mines, gold <b>mines,</b> oil <b>rigs,</b> and electric power stations.|$|R
40|$|Interpreting data {{collected}} from the <b>mining</b> <b>rigs</b> provides challenge which is alleviated with help of visualization techniques. A good visualization shows all the relevant information at a glance and helps make decisions. In mining the information {{can be used for}} example to follow the concentration of the mined minerals, adjust drill settings according the rock properties, track wear of drill bits, make drill plans, detonation plans and bolting plans in order to ensure efficient and safe work. This thesis concentrates on finding the best ways to present the data from drilling machines. It has three main points: 3 D visualization for analyzing large batches of collected drill data, real time drill visualization for use in the drill equipment during and immediately after the drilling and interpolation to find ways to interpret and expand from the data available. All the features in this thesis are built into a DrillGraph software, {{to be used as a}} basis for actual products...|$|R
2500|$|According to {{explosives}} experts, Basayev {{was most}} likely a victim of careless handling of the mine, {{but it is also}} not out of the question that the FSB could have been involved– as they would claim {{in the aftermath of the}} detonation. This could have happened if the shipment of weapons was seized and the smugglers detained; in forcing the captured smugglers to cooperate, an ordinary-looking anti-personnel <b>mine</b> <b>rigged</b> with an extra-sensitive fuse or radio-controlled detonator could have been inserted amongst the cargo. The device almost certainly would have caused suspicion when discovered in the shipment, which might explain why Basayev stopped to inspect it, at that point triggering the explosion. It was also not ruled out that an unknown FSB operative set off the blast by remote control, but in the event that this was indeed the case, it almost assuredly would not have been a [...] "targeted" [...] killing, as identifying Basayev in the dark– even with the aid of night-vision goggles– would have been exceedingly difficult. Thus, experts have concluded that if it was a remote-controlled blast, it was intended to eliminate the weapons shipment and whoever the recipients were, rather than specifically Basayev.|$|R
50|$|Mining {{drilling}} rigs {{are used for}} two main purposes, exploration drilling which aims to identify the location and quality of a mineral, and production drilling, used in the production-cycle for <b>mining.</b> Drilling <b>rigs</b> used for rock blasting for surface mines vary in size dependent {{on the size of}} the hole desired, and is typically classified into smaller pre-split and larger production holes. Underground mining (hard rock) uses a variety of drill rigs dependent on the desired purpose, such as production, bolting, cabling, and tunnelling.|$|R

50|$|The pair is {{eventually}} cornered {{in front of}} an abandoned <b>mine</b> shaft entrance <b>rigged</b> with dynamite, until they’re rescued by the Minotauks and the crooks are disabled. Ben is impressed and finally gives his approval of Jack and consents to Jack proposing to Sandy. The two complete the beach collage, which symbolizes that the three of them are finally whole as a family. Jack and Sandy marry, with the Minotauks in attendance at the wedding, and despite nothing being perfect, all are happy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical model {{to calculate the}} optimal replacement time (ORT) of drilling rigs used in underground mining. As a case study, cost data for drilling rig were collected over four years from a Swedish mine. The cost data include acquisition, operating, maintenance and downtime costs when using a redundant rig. A discount rate is {{used to determine the}} value of these costs over time. The study develops an optimisation model to identify the ORT of a <b>mining</b> drilling <b>rig</b> which re{{presents a}} key performance indicator. It uses an artificial neural network (ANN) technique to identify the effect of the various cost factors on the ORT. The absolute ORT in the case study is 87 months, and there is an optimal replacement range within which the company can replace the rig. The results also show that the redundant rig cost has the largest impact on the ORT followed by acquisition, maintenance and operating costs. Regression analysis shows a linear relationship between the cost factors and the ORT of the drilling rig. Godkänd; 2014; 20140917 (hasham...|$|R
5|$|Bond goes to San Francisco {{where he}} learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin {{could be the}} product of medical {{experimentation}} with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician, Dr. Carl Mortner. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording Zorin's conversation. Ivanova's partner Klolktoff is captured and killed while trying to place limpet <b>mines</b> on the <b>rig,</b> but Ivanova and Bond escape. They go to her place where Bond is able to steal the recording. Bond tracks down the woman that Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to purchase her family's oil business.|$|R
40|$|A light, <b>mining</b> drill <b>rig</b> {{deployed}} {{from the}} stern of a research vessel {{has been used to}} carry out shallow drilling in 212 m water depth on the continental shelf in the eastern Weddell Sea. Penetration was 15 m below the seabed with 18 % recovery in the 31 hours available for the experiment. The recovered glacigenic sediments are predominantly volcanic material of basaltic and andesitic composition with petrological characteristics and age similar to the continental flood basalts exposed in Vestfjella, about 130 km upstream from the drill site. The sediments include a reworked marine Miocene diatom flora. The material documents oscillations of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet over the past 30 ka. The lowermost diamicton probably represents a deformation till, and the grounding line retreated past the drill site 30 km from the shelf edge about 30 kyr BP. A readvance occurred during the Late Wisconsin Glacial Maximum. Assuming a reservoir correction of 1300 yr, marine conditions existed at the site between 10. 1 - 7 kyr BP, and later at least between 2. 8 and 2. 5 kyr BP. The stratigraphy at the site has been disturbed by iceberg ploughing and/or contact between the ice shelf and the sea floor during local advances after 2. 5 kyr BP...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making methodologies for {{evaluating}} a product’s end-of-life options {{have become a}} significant area of research. Extensive work {{has been carried out}} in the area of product recovery, e. g. module-based disassemblability, reverse logistics, remanufacturing, material recyclability, among others. Some of these methods use graphical representations in the form of disassembly trees and/or networks to find feasible solutions with computational approaches, but have not been made applicable to larger, more complex electrohydraulic mechanical systems. The work presented in this paper aims to apply a disassembly assessment technique by comparing a component’s disassembly effort to a reward such as recycling value or energy recovery from recycling. First, the disassembly network is represented by a directed graph where weighted edges represent reward/cost. Next, an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the optimal disassembly path that minimizes the sum of the edge weights. Lastly, the optimal disassembly paths for each individual reward are compared to discover the globally optimal disassembly scenario. This method is applied to a real-world case study of an underground <b>mining</b> drill <b>rig</b> with direct contributions from engineers involved {{in the development of the}} machine itself. Specific component recovery options are recommended based on the methodology and alternative design practices are suggested to improve product recyclability...|$|R
50|$|In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe series, {{he first}} {{appeared}} in issue #64. He joins the team with multiple Joes, including the undercover specialist Chuckles. The two hadnt quite gotten the clearance {{to know that there}} is anything below ground at the new Joe base. They do not understand and are highly suspicious of clues pointing to the official Joe space shuttle, the USS Defiant. Multiple Joes appearing from a secret trapdoor did not help. He appears in #67 to help assist in the difficult tensions that arise when the captured Joes, Quick-Kick, Snow-Job and Stalker finally return. He suggests that Scarlett and Snake Eyes defiance of orders that led to the trios safe return was mental instability caused by a close call with a land <b>mine</b> (actually, a <b>rigged</b> explosion).|$|R
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet <b>mines</b> to the <b>rig's</b> legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|R
2500|$|WFM member Harry Orchard later {{confessed to}} setting the {{dynamite}} bomb on the 600-foot level {{next to the}} <b>mine</b> shaft, and <b>rigging</b> it to explode when the next person got off on that level. He wrote that he and another WFM member, Billy Aiken, had entered the mine through an old unused shaft, and that a third, Billy Gaffney, had stayed at the surface as a lookout. Orchard wrote {{that he had been}} paid to plant the dynamite by Mr. Davis, the president of the Altman local, one of the WFM locals in the Cripple Creek district. When they heard nothing about an explosion during the next few days, they assumed that their bomb had failed to explode. But they had mistakenly set the bomb on an inactive level, and it did not go off until some time later, when the superintendent and the shift boss got off to inspect the 600-foot level, and set off the dynamite.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the mine}} portal entrances to Quecreek mine nearly under water, rescue {{operations}} started immediately. While pumping water would begin at all mine locations and any nearby {{residential and commercial}} water wells, the mine rescue first focused on getting air to the trapped miners. With the help of Bob Long, an engineer technician for Civil Mining Environmental Engineering, GPS measurements were made and a 6.5 in borehole was begun at 2:05 a.m. The borehole was drilled to allow air to be pumped into the mineshaft where the miners were presumed to be, at the most up dip location near where the Saxman mine was breached. A four-member team started working about 3:15 a.m. Thursday, and its drill cracked through {{what turned out to}} be 240 ft of rock, and into the mine shaft 1 hour and 45 minutes later. On July 25, at 5:06 a.m., approximately 8 hours after the breakthrough, the 6.5 in hole was drilled into the <b>mine.</b> The drilling <b>rig's</b> air compressor pushed air into the mine, and the air returns from the borehole showed a marginal air quality of 19.3 percent oxygen. Rescue workers tapped on the inserted air pipe, and at 5:12 a.m. received 3 strong bangs in response, followed by 9 taps at 11:40 a.m.|$|R
