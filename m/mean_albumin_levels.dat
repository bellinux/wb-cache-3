40|$|Aim: Peritonitis {{is almost}} the most {{frequent}} complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Besides being the most frequent reason of hospitalization, peritonitis {{is also the most}} important determining factor of mortality-morbidity and technique survival among PD patients. In this study, it was aimed to identify the risk factors for peritonitis in these patients. Materials and methods: In this clinical cohort, records of 218 patients were collected between January 1998 and December 2007. The patients ’ demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were recorded. Results were analyzed to compare patients who never had peritonitis and patients with at least one episode of peritonitis. Independent predictors of peritonitis were assessed using Cox regression, and the hazard ratio (HR) was determined using 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Results: Of over 6304 patient-months, 337 episodes of peritonitis were observed. The overall peritonitis rate was 0. 64 attack/year.

40|$|Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a {{predictor}} of cardiovascular diseases in both normal people and patients on hemodialysis. This study aimed to assess the relationship of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) serum level and peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Methods: 113 patients on peritoneal dialysis in Isfahan city, Iran, participated in our study in 2015. Serum albumin and Hs-CRP levels were measured in each patient at three times (baseline, and 6 and 12 month after that) and the patients were followed up for 1 year. All the patients were evaluated for peritonitis in every visit. At {{the end of the}} study, two groups of patients on peritoneal dialysis with and without peritonitis were compared. Findings: Among 113 patients, 24 were excluded from the study because of death or kidney transplantation and 89 patients were included in final analysis. The mean Hs-CRP levels in patients with peritonitis were 4. 83, 5. 79, and 7. 42 mg/l at baseline, and 6 and 12 month after it, respectively; these levels were 4. 47, 3. 19, and 2. 69 mg/l in patients without peritonitis, respectively. In addition, the <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in patient with peritonitis were 3. 38, 3. 29 and 3. 40 mg/l at baseline, and 6 and 12 month after it, respectively; these values were 3. 56, 4. 05, and 3. 51 mg/l in patients without peritonitis, respectively. Conclusion: Results showed that with increase in Hs-CRP level, the risk of peritonitis increased. Besides, the albumin level decreased among patients with peritonitis in comparison with patients without peritonitis; there was no significant correlation between albumin level and peritonitis. © 2017, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

The <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> in this population was 3. 9 g/dl (standard deviation 0. 3). During 5. 2 years of follow-up, 470 incident CHD events occurred. The hazard ratio for incident CHD associated with a 1 -standard deviation decrease in serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 1. 26 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 1. 15, 1. 38) after adjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity and 1. 18 (95 % Cl: 1. 07, 1. 30) after additional adjustment for covariates related to CHD. Hazard ratios were similar across gender and ethnic groups. However, there was statistically significant effect modification by smoking status, with hazard ratios of 1. 01 (95 % Cl: 0. 84, 1. 22) among never smokers, 1. 09 (95 % Cl: 0. 92, 1. 30) among former smokers, and 1. 35 (95 % Cl: 1. 17, 1. 54) among current smokers.

It has been emphasized that inflammation contributes to diabetic complications and that gliclazide-an antidiabetic sulfonylurea- decreases the development of such complications. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether gliclazide or diet treatment has an effect on serum levels of acute phase reactants, markers of inflammation. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes and 30 clinically healthy subjects were evaluated prospectively. Twenty-six patients were treated with proper diet and daily gliclazide (80 mg/daily) and 30 patients were randomized to only diet therapy for 6 months. After the 6 -month therapy, blood was taken from patients and controls and acute phase protein levels were determined. Results: Serum alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein, alpha- 2 macroglobulin, alpha- 1 antitrypsin, and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> did not differ between the gliclazide and control groups. In the diet group, mean serum alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein, alpha- 2 macroglobulin, and alpha- 1 antitrypsin were significantly higher and <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was significantly lower than the other groups. Glucose, hemoglobin A 1 C and haptoglobulin levels were significantly higher, whereas transferrin and prealbumin levels were significantly lower in both diet therapy and gliclazide therapy when compared with the control group.

Results: The <b>mean</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were 40. 2 ¡ 4. 0 g/L in patients with mania (N= 25), 39. 8 ¡ 2. 8 g/L in patients with major depression (N= 36), and 45. 8 ¡ 2. 0 g/L in the control group. Patients with mania (F= 64. 6, p = 0. 000) and major depression (F= 68. 9, p = 0. 000), respectively, had significantly lower <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> than the control group after age adjustment. However, for the patients with major depression, no significant difference in serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were found between patients who had attempted suicide and those who had not.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{malnutrition}} in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF); type 1 and type 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between malnutrition and inflammation and also the relationship between malnutrition and volume status. Ninety-four pre-dialysis CRF patients were included in the study. Nutritional status of the patients was calculated using the subjective global assessment. Scores of 1 - 5 were given according to the severity of the symptoms and physical examination findings. Serum inflammation markers [high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin- 1 β, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alfa] and nutrition parameters (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, fetuin-A, insulin like growth factor- 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 3) ] were measured in all the patients. Serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels and echocardiography were performed to evaluate the volume status of the patients. The mean age of the patients was 59. 6 ± 13. 3 years, the mean malnutrition score was 17. 2 ± 6. 01, the mean and the median of hs-CRP levels were 18. 5 ± 40. 7 and 5. 6 mg/L, respectively, the <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 3. 46 ± 0. 48 and the mean creatinine clearance was 23. 7 ± 13. 5 mL/min. A positive correlation between malnutrition scores with inflammation and volume parameters was found in the bivariate and multivariate analysis. In the multiple regression analysis, volume parameters proved to be the most important factors influencing malnutrition scores. Thus, the elimination of volume excess would ameliorate both inflammation and malnutrition. This hypothesis needs to be supported or proved with prospective studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES]The <b>level</b> of serum <b>albumin</b> is {{an index}} of {{nourishment}} care and management. However, the distribution and correlates of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> among individuals with motor disorders have not been reported until now. Therefore, we examined the distribution and correlates of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> among individuals with motor disorders. [SUBJECTS/METHODS]A cross-sectional study on 249 individuals with motor disabilities (144 men, mean age: 51. 4 years; 105 women, mean age: 51. 4 years) was conducted at five institutions in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan in 2008. The results were compared with data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey. [RESULTS]The <b>mean</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were 4. 0 ± 0. 4 g/dL for men and 3. 8 ± 0. 5 g/dL for women. Overall, 17 (11. 8 %) men and 25 (23. 8 %) women had hypoalbuminemia (serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> ≤ 3. 5 g/dL); these proportions were greater than those among healthy Japanese adults (≤ 1 %). Low serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was related with female sex, older age, low calf circumference, low relative daily energy intake, low hemoglobin (Hb), low blood platelet count, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low HbA 1 c, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The strongest correlates, based on standardized betas, were Hb (0. 321), CRP (- 0. 279), and HDL-C (0. 279) levels. [CONCLUSIONS]These {{results indicate that the}} prevalence of hypoalbuminemia is higher in individuals with motor disabilities than in healthy individuals and that inflammation is a strong negative correlate of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels.</b> Therefore, inflammation should be examined for the assessment of hypoalbuminemia among institutionalized individuals with motor disabilities...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether single endoscopist-performed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) {{is safe and}} to compare the complications of PEG with those reported in the literature. METHODS: Patients who underwent PEG placement between June 2001 and August 2011 at the Baskent University Alanya Teaching and Research Center were evaluated retrospectively. Patients whose PEG was placed {{for the first time}} by a single endoscopist were enrolled in the study. PEG was performed using the pull method. All of the patients were evaluated for their indications for PEG, major and minor complications resulting from PEG, nutritional status, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the use of antibiotic treatment or antibiotic prophylaxis prior to PEG. Comorbidities, rates, time and reasons for mortality were also evaluated. The reasons for PEG removal and PEG duration were also investigated. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients underwent the PEG procedure for the first time during this study. Eight patients who underwent PEG placement by 2 endoscopists were not enrolled in the study. A total of 54 patients were investigated. The patients&#x 2019; mean age was 69. 9 years. The most common indication for PEG was cerebral infarct, which occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. The <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 3. 04 1; 0. 7 g/dL, and 76. 2 % of the patients&#x 2019; <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were below the normal values. The mean CRP level was high in 90. 6 % of patients prior to the procedure. Approximately two-thirds of the patients received antibiotics for either prophylaxis or treatment for infections prior to the PEG procedure. Mortality was not related to the procedure in any of the patients. Buried bumper syndrome was the only major complication, and it occurred in the third year. In such case, the PEG was removed and a new PEG tube was placed via surgery. Eight patients (15. 1 %) experienced minor complications, 6 (11. 1 %) of which were wound infections. All wound infections except one recovered with antibiotic treatment. Two patients had bleeding from the PEG site, one was resolved with primary suturing and the other with fresh frozen plasma transfusion. CONCLUSION: The incidence of major and minor complications is in keeping with literature. This finding may be noteworthy, especially in developing countries...|$|R

Seven patients (11.7 %) {{had at least one}} family history of gastrointestinal cancer in a related. The postoperative body mass index (BMI) was 23.2  ±  3.2  kg/m 2. The <b>mean</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 31 +/ 9.3  g/l. Twenty-two patients (35 %) suffered from malnutrition and had received preoperative nutritional rehabilitation. The most frequently reported tumor location was the gastric antrum (40 %). Five patients (8.3 %) had a pan-gastric extension. Preoperative chemotherapy was performed in 18.3 % of patients. Total gastrectomy was performed in 28 patients (46.7 %). Twenty-three had partial gastrectomy (2 / 3), and 9 subtotal gastrectomy (4 / 5). Enlarged gastrectomy was performed in 3 patients (5 %). The mean operative time was 244.3  ±  58  min. Per-operative transfusion was required in 14 patients (23.3 %). The average length of stay in ICU was 8.2  ±  5  days. Postoperative mortality was 6.7 %. In our series, 13 patients (21.7 %) had at least one postoperative complication: An anastomotic fistula diagnosed in 7 patients (11.7 %), 12 patients (11.3 %) had postoperative peritonitis and 6 patients had ventilator associated pneumonia. Reoperation was necessary for 13 patients (21.7 %), it was performed after 7.2  days (2 – 18  days).

40|$|The high {{prevalence}} of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) {{is a critical}} issue for patients with end stage of renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the nutritional indices of hemodialysis patients (HP) with healthy male subjects (control group) of the same age. Mean body mass index (BMI) was significantly low (p< 0. 001) in patients as compared with the control group (23 ± 3. 8 vs 30. 2 ± 3. 5 kg/m 2, respectively). Similarly, the patients had body weight lower than control group. The analysis of food intake showed that the mean energy and protein intakes were significantly lower in HP than the healthy subjects. Notably all patients had energy below the recommended intake of HP (30 kcal/kg/d), meanwhile, only 25 % of the patients had the protein intake above 1. 2 g/kg/d. The total proteins and <b>mean</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly low (p< 0. 001) in patients as compared with healthy subjects (66 ± 0. 42 vs 7. 5 ± 0. 3 g/dL and 3. 05 ± 0. 39 vs 4. 5 ± 0. 35 g/dL, respectively). Moreover, 81. 3 % of the patients had serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> less than 3. 5 g/dL, and 59. 4 % of these patients had moderate deficit (serum albumin: 2. 98 - 3. 5 g/dL) while 21. 9 % of them had a severe deficit (serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> of lower than 2. 98 g/dL).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to look for {{correlation}} between the markers for malnu-trition and inflammation, and atherosclerosis in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This observational study involved 100 pre dialysis patients (age 57 &# 177; 12 years) from the out-patient and in-patient departments over a span of two years. Informed consent was obtained from all the study patients. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was assayed as a marker of chronic inflammation. Nutritional status was assessed using serum albumin and body mass index (BMI). Clinical and laboratory data were collected and a carotid doppler study was performed using duplex ultrasonography method to look for carotid artery stenosis. Renal function was assessed by cal-culating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the MDRD- 2 formula. These data were later analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and the students&#x 2032; t test. The mean GFR was 28. 3 &# 177; 16. 4 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. The mean value of CRP was 14. 3 &# 177; 11. 4 mg /L. Sixty-seven percent of patients had elevated CRP (> 6 mg/L) levels. Patients with higher CRP levels showed lower <b>mean</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (3. 2 &# 177; 0. 7 gm/dL) (P < 0. 01). Only three patients had evidence of hemodynamically significant carotid disease (lumen diameter < 50 &#x 0025;) with no statistical signifi-cance. Low serum <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with low hemoglobin levels (< 10 gm/dL), low GFR and presence of diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Background: Usefulness of {{hemoglobin}} and albumin as prognostic markers {{for highly}} active anti-retroviral therapy for HIV- 1 infection. Introduction: Anemia and hypoalbuminemia are common complications in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection. We aimed to investigate the changes in hemoglobin and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in response to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). Further, we evaluated the appropriateness of using hemoglobin and albumin as HIV disease progression markers. Materials and Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of 122 subjects was carried out. Pre-treatment, one year, and two year post-treatment hemoglobin, and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were correlated with respective CD 4 + T cell counts. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of each marker against CD 4 + T cell counts were calculated in order to establish the appropriateness of use of these parameters as surrogate disease progression and prognostic markers. Results: <b>Mean</b> hemoglobin and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> pre-, one, and two year post HAART were 9. 7 g/dL, 12. 1 g/dL, and 13. 1 g/dL, respectively, P = 0. 001; albumin: 3. 7 gm%, 4. 4 gm%, and 4. 7 gm%, respectively, P = 0. 001. There was a positive correlation between hemoglobin, albumin, and CD 4 + T cell count at pre-treatment, one year, and two year post-treatment visit. Both albumin and hemoglobin had high sensitivity when compared to CD 4 + T cell counts. Conclusions: Hemoglobin and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were found to increase after initiation of HAART. Hemoglobin and albumin were seen to be a strong prognostic marker of HIV disease progression at pre-, one, and two year post-treatment.

The selectivity index for proteinuria (a clearance ratio of IgG to transferrin) was 0. 10 or less in all of the five children examined. All of the eight children responded quickly to the prednisolone therapy. Grades of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia were lower in the asymptomatic children than in the symptomatic children who presented with edema.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the nutrition status of chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. The study was carried out in 61 CRF patients (29 males and 32 females) who had been undergoing Maintenance Hemodialysis (MH). The mean intake of energy was 19. 4 ± 6. 8 kcal/kg/day. Notably 95. 1 % of patients had energy intake below the recommendations for hemodialysis patients (HP) (30 - 35 kcal/kg/day). The mean intake of dietary protein was 0. 8 ± 0. 4 g/kg/day which was substantially less than the recommended intake for hemodialysis patients (HP) (1. 2 - 1. 4 g/kg/day). About 82 % of patients had the protein intake below 1. 2 g/kg/day. The intake of calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin C, vitamin B 6, folate and vitamin B 12 was also inadequate. Most of patients had intake of these nutrients below the recommendations. The <b>mean</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 3. 37 ± 6. 5 g dL - 1 which was substantially less than normal range.
