However, unlike SAM-I and SAM-IV riboswitches, the variant riboswitches entirely lack an internal loop in P2.

40|$|<b>MultiStem</b> {{cells are}} clinical-grade {{multipotent}} adult bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (MAPCs), with extensive replication potential and broader differentiation capacity compared with mesenchymal stem cells. Human MAPCs suppress T-cell proliferation induced by alloantigens and mutually interact with allogeneic natural killer cells. In this study, {{the interaction between}} <b>MultiStem</b> and CD 8 (+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was addressed for the first time. In an in vitro setting, the immunogenicity of <b>MultiStem,</b> the susceptibility of <b>MultiStem</b> toward CTL-mediated lysis, {{and its effects on}} CTL function were investigated. <b>MultiStem</b> was nonimmunogenic for alloreactive CTL induction and was-even after major histocompatibility complex class I upregulation-insensitive to alloantigen-specific CTL-mediated lysis. Furthermore, <b>MultiStem</b> reduced CTL proliferation and significantly decreased perforin expression during the T-cell activation phase. As a consequence, <b>MultiStem</b> dose-dependently impaired the induction of CTL function. These effects of <b>MultiStem</b> were mediated predominantly through contact-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, <b>MultiStem</b> cells considerably influenced the expression of T-cell activation markers CD 25, CD 69, and human leukocyte antigen-DR. The MultiStem-induced CD 8 (-) CD 69 (+) T-cell population displayed a suppressive effect on the induction of CTL function during a subsequent mixed-lymphocyte culture. Finally, the killer activity of activated antigen-specific CTLs during their cytolytic effector phase was also diminished in the presence of <b>MultiStem.</b> This study confirms that these clinical-grade MAPCs are an immune-modulating population that inhibits CTL activation and effector responses and are, consequently, a highly valuable cell population for adoptive immunosuppressive therapy in diseases where damage is induced by CTLs. status: publishe...|$|E

The study had two objectives: (1) {{determine the extent of}} operator productivity variation between six processor operators in a harvesting operation; and (2) determine potential cost implications associated with operator productivity variation. The study was carried out on the Zululand coastal plains near Kwambonambi. A <b>multistem</b> mechanised harvesting system, working in Eucalyptus grandis × camaldulensis pulpwood stands (with an average rotation length of seven years) was observed. The operators had all been operating their respective processors for 18 months; i. e. since the inception of the harvesting operation and had received similar in-house training. Time studies were carried out on the processors' cycle times, and note taken of the respective operators working the machines during the time studies. Cycle time for each machine was measured as the time between a delimbed and debarked tree length leaving the processor head and the following tree length leaving the head. The required number of observations per processor was determined by cycle time and work element time variation. It was found that operators varied by up to 58 % in terms of productivity, 24 % in terms of utilisation and 70 % in terms of cost.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{our understanding of}} the dynamics and complexities of the RNA folding process, and therewith to improve our ability to predict RNA secondary structure by computational means, we have examined the foldings {{of a large number of}} phylogenetically and structurally diverse 16 S and 16 S-like rRNAs and compared these results with their comparatively derived secondary structures. Our initial goals are to establish the range of prediction success for this class of rRNAs, and to begin comparing and contrasting the foldings of these RNAs. We focus here on structural features that are predicted with confidence as well as those that are poorly predicted. Whereas the large set of Archaeal and (eu) Bacterial 16 S rRNAs all fold well (69 % and 55 % respectively), some as high as 80 %, many Eucarya and mitochondrial 16 S rRNAs are poorly predicted (approximately 30 %), with a few of these predicted as low as 10 - 20 %. In general, base pairs interacting over a short distance and, in particular, those closing hairpin loops, are predicted significantly better than long-range base pairs and those closing <b>multistem</b> loops and bulges. The prediction success of hairpin loops varies, however, with their size and context. Analysis of some of the RNAs that do not fold well suggests that the composition of some hairpin loops (e. g., tetraloops) and the higher frequency of noncanonical pairs in their comparatively derived structures might contribute to these lower success rates. Eucarya and mitochondrial rRNAs reveal further novel tetraloop motifs, URRG/A and CRRG, that interchange with known stable tetraloop in the procaryotes...|$|E

Patients received increasing doses of MAPC (1, 5, or 10 million cells per kilogram recipient weight) as a single i. v. dose on day + 2 after HCT (n = 18), or once weekly for up to 5 doses (1 or 5 million cells per kilogram; n = 18). Infusional and regimen-related toxicities were assessed for 30 days after the last MAPC dose. Of 36 allogeneic HCT donors (17 related and 19 unrelated), 35 were 6 / 6 HLA matched. MAPC infusions were well tolerated without associated infusional toxicity, graft failure, or increased incidence of infection. Median times to neutrophil (n = 36) and platelet (n = 31) engraftment were 15 (range, 11 to 25) and 16 (range, 11 to 41) days, respectively. The overall cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III and IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day 100 were 37 % and 14 %, respectively (n = 36). In the group that received the highest single MAPC dose (10 million cells/kg), day 100 incidence of grade II to IV GVHD was 11. 1 % (1 of 9) with no observed cases of grade III and IV GVHD. We found no evidence for MHC class II allogeneic antibody induction, although some patients showed an increase in serum anticlass I titers compared with baseline.

These phase I data support the safety of stromal stem cell therapy and suggest that MAPC should be tested prospectively as a novel therapeutic option for GVHD prophylaxis after HCT...|$|E
40|$|Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are bone marrow-derived non-hematopoietic {{stem cells}} {{with a broad}} {{differentiation}} potential and extensive expansion capacity. A comparative study between human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human MAPCs (hMAPCs) has shown that hMAPCs have clearly distinct phenotypical and functional characteristics from hMSCs. In particular, hMAPCs express lower levels of MHC class I than hMSCs and can not only differentiate into typical mesenchymal cell types, but can also differentiate in vitro and in vivo into functional endothelial cells. The use of hMSCs as cellular immunomodulatory stem cell products gained much interest since their immunomodulatory capacities in vitro became evident over the last decade. Currently, the clinical grade stem cell product of hMAPCs is already used in clinical trials to prevent graft-versus host disease (GVHD), {{as well as for}} the treatment of acute myocardial infarct, ischemic stroke, andCrohn's disease. Therefore we studied the immune phenotype, immunogenicity andimmunosuppressive effect of hMAPCs in vitro. We demonstrated that hMAPCs are non immunogenic for T cell proliferation and cytokine production. In addition, hMAPCs exert strong immunosuppressive effects on T cell alloreactivity, and on T cell proliferation induced by mitogens and recall antigens. This immunomodulatory effect was not MHC-restricted, which makes off-the-shelf use promising. The immunosuppressive effect of hMAPCs is partially mediated via soluble factors and dependent on indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) activity. At last, we isolated hMAPCs, the clinical grade stem cell product of hMAPCs, named <b>MultiStem,</b> and hMSCs from one single donor and observed that both the immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive capacities of all three stem cell products are comparable in vitro. In conclusion, hMAPCs have potent immunomodulatory properties in vitro and can serve as a valuable cell source for the clinical use of immunomodulatory cellular stem cell product. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{long-term}} self-renewal ability and functional multi-lineage differentiation capacity, {{stem cells are}} highly attractive c andidates for many applications. Both embryon ic and adult stem cells have been explored as ther apeutic strategies {{in the context of}} tissue regene ration. Over the years, it has become clear that a dult stem cells also possess a wide rang e of immune and inflammation modulating properties. Many research groups have studied the immunologi cal behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in v itro and their role as an adoptive immune reg ulatory cell population in several immune-related disorders. Nowadays, other adult adheren t stem cell populations have been characterized an d are being considered to exhibit more potenc y compared to MSCs. Recently, human multipote nt adult progenitor cells (hMAPCs) have thoroughly been studied and {{have been shown to be}} clear ly distinct from hMSCs. In contrast to hMSCs, hMAP Cs can be expanded for a significantly longer time ¨and – besides mesenchymal cell types & ndash; also differentiate into functional end othelium in vitro and in vivo. Clinical-grade prod uction of MAPCs has been achieved and, curren tly, this proprietary large-scale expanded stem ce ll product (MultiStem®) is being evaluated as¨ an allogeneic ‘off-the-shelf’ stem cel l product in the clinic in the fields of regenerat ive medicine for cardiovascular (acute myocardial¨ infarction; AMI) and neurological diseases (i schemic stroke) and as immunotherapy in immun e-associated disorders [graft-versus-host disease¨ (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplantation (HSCT), solid organ transplantation¨ and autoimmunity). Even though administ ration of clinical-grade hMAPCs appears to be ¨safe and well-tolerated, and leads to benefi cial (preliminary) clinical results, data regardin g their immunological behavior in vitro are s carce. A better understanding of the exact immune¨ regulatory mechanism would be very valuable t o optimize future clinical studies on the immunotherapeutic function of hMAPCs and of adult stem cel ls in general. In the presented manuscript, in con tinuation of a former project in this specific res earch line, we addressed the issue by investi gating the reciprocal interaction between (clinica l-grade) hMAPCs and immune cells of a functional h uman immune system in vitro. Given the fact t hat cytotoxic immune effector cells play a cr ucial role in immune homeostasis and in the p athogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, ¨we analyzed the influence of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs on the phenotype and functionality of nat ural killer (NK) cells and CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells¨ (CTLs). The first specific objective of this ¨research was to explore the immunogenic and immun e modulatory properties of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs, with regard to functional cytotoxic responses of ¨NK cells and T cells. More specific, it was quest ioned whether these stem cells of alloge neic origin could act as stimulators, as fore ign target cells or as modulators of NK cells and CTLs. We showed that hMAPCs are not able to induce an antigen-specific ‒ a nd only a minimal anti-CD 3 -redirected ‒ CTL response in vitro. Furthermore, allogene ic hMAPCs were insensitive to antigen-sp ecific CTL-mediated lysis and to killing by r esting KIR-mismatched NK cells, despite expression ¨of some ligands (PVR and ULBP- 2 / 5 / 6) of activatin g NK cell receptors (respectively DNAM- 1 and NKG 2 D). On the other hand, IL- 2 -preactiv ated NK cells efficiently lysed allogeneic hMAPCs. ¨However, increased MHC class I expression af ter IFN-γ-pretreatment of hMAPCs did not res ult in higher MHC-I-dependent allorecognition by C TLs and reduced hMAPC susceptibility to preac tivated NK cell-mediated killing, by shifting the¨ balance towards MHC-I-associated inhibitory N K cell signalling. These results indicate low ¨immunogenicity of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs in vitr o, and suggest that survival of hMAPCs in viv o will primarily be dictated by the inflammat ory status and the cytokine balance in the local microenvironment. Secondly, we proved that hMA PCs exert strong immune suppressive effects, as th ey are able to suppress alloreactive CTL prol iferation and IL- 2 -induced expansion of allogeneic ¨NK cells. The suppressive effect on NK cell proliferation is dose- and IDO-dependent, and is m ore pronounced for hMAPCs than for hMSCs ¨from the same donor. In addition, we observed a reduced cytotoxic function of restin g NK cells and activated CTLs (in an ant igen-specific and anti-CD 3 -redirected cytotoxicity ¨system) in the presence of allogeneic third-party ¨hMAPCs during the lytic effector phase. hMAP Cs also directly and dose-dependently impaired ind uction of CTL cytotoxicity during their priming phase (alloantigen-induced or polyclonal a ctivation) by interfering with their perforin expression. On the other hand, in contrast t o their inhibitory effect on NK cell prolifer ation, hMAPCs had no influence on the intrins ic cytotoxic properties of NK cells during th e IL- 2 -mediated activation phase. Because of compe tition between hMAPCs and K 562 cells as targe t cells for IL- 2 -activated NK cell-mediated k illing, we could not conclude if hMAPCs influ ence the killer function of IL- 2 -activated NK cells during their effector phase. Taken together, our observations imply that (clinical-grade) hMA PCs impair both proliferative and cytotoxic NK and T cell responses, resulting in a lower immun e response in vitro. The second specific goa l of this thesis was to further elaborate the immune modulatory mechanism of (clinical-gra de) hMAPCs and to identify responsible immune ¨regulatory factors and pathways. We demonstrated¨ that the mode of action is multifactorial and ¨depends on the studied immune effector response. ¨ In case of proliferation suppression, we coul d ascribe a partial role to IDO for hMAPC-med iated impairment of NK cell proliferation, in line ¨with previously obtained results for T cell¨ expansion inhibition. In contrast, we could n ot identify a single responsible soluble factor (IDO, PGE 2, IL- 10 and TGF-β) in NK ce ll cytotoxicity suppression. Transwell experiments showed contact-dependency of hMAPCs to¨ exert their suppressive function on T cell cytotox icity. Until now, as is the case for NK cells, we did not detect a single responsible ¨contact-dependent mechanism in hMAPC-mediated T c ell cytotoxicity suppression. Though, we desc ribed for the first time hMAPC expressio n of galectin- 1 and ligands of the immun e inhibitory PD- 1 pathway (PD-L 1 / 2) and¨ of the Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway (FasL). Functional blocking studies however did not confirm the latter two pathways as suppressiv e candidates in CTL function inhibition by hMAPCs. With regard to the suppressed T cell phenoty pe, we observed that the presence of hMAPCs does n ot result in T cell apoptosis or anergy and t hat T cells retain their memory response duri ng a secondary immune reaction after removal¨ of hMAPCs. However, hMAPCs largely disturb th e activation marker expression of T cells. In ¨hMAPC-modulated T cells, CD 69 expression was ¨clearly and persistently increased, in both CD 8 -¨ and CD 8 + T cell populations. Moreover, HLA-DR ¨and CD 25 (IL- 2 Rα) upregulation were signifi cantly decreased in the presence of hMAPCs. hMAPCs ¨downregulated CD 25 expression to a lower ext ent on CD 8 T cells and shifted those cells p ossibly towards a regulatory phenotype. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that (cl inical-grade) hMAPCs are low immunogenic ¨and have potent immunosuppressive effects in ¨vitro on NK cells and CTLs. In addition, we have¨ contributed to a better understanding of the¨ complex immunomodulatory mechanism. Based on these findings, we can state that the rationa le for therapeutic use of hMAPCs or its clinical-g rade counterpart <b>MultiStem</b> as an off-the-shel f adoptive cell population in the context of¨ immune-related disorders is legitimate. These data may represent an extensive co ntribution to the current knowledge and, in combination with the results of future phase II/III ¨trials using <b>MultiStem,</b> will lead to an intriguing continuation of stem cell-based resear ch for immunotherapy. nrpages: 136 status: publishe...|$|E
