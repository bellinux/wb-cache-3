She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied <b>medical</b> <b>notes</b> on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her.

2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful.

But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know that if I were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Supportive care is {{increasingly}} being {{viewed as an}} appropriate alternative option to dialysis or transplantation for older people with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD). The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the information needs of older people with ACKD who choose supportive care as their treatment. Methods: A case study approach using semi-structured interviews and <b>medical</b> case <b>note</b> review methods was used to explore the information needs of six older people receiving supportive care. Results: The majority of the information the participants had recalled receiving placed a greater emphasis on dialysis over supportive care. Although they did not want dialysis, they were not clear on what supportive care meant or whether they had a supportive care plan. Participants perceived they had never been given specific information about supportive care. <b>Medical</b> case <b>note</b> review revealed infrequent and non-systematic documentation in <b>medical</b> case <b>notes.</b> Conclusions: In the absence of a formal nephrology supportive care program, information may be provided in an unplanned, non-systematic approach to older people and their families who choose supportive care...|$|R
