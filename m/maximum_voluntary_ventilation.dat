This study was designed to determine changes in cardiopulmonary functions after aerobic and anaerobic exercise train-ing in obese subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Forty obese subjects, whose ages ranged between 18 and 25 years, were divided into 2 equal groups: group A received aerobic exercise training in addition to dietary measures, and group B received anaerobic exercise training for 3 months in addition to dietary measures. Measurements of systol-ic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation,</b> maximal oxygen consump-tion, and body mass index were obtained for both groups before and after the exercise program. [Results] The mean body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and maximal oxygen consumption decreased significantly, whereas the mean <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> increased significantly after treatment in group A. The mean <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> also increased significantly after treatment in group B.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxidative stress, diaphragm fatigue and inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on the cytokine response to <b>maximum</b> sustainable <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> (MSVV) is unknown. Twelve healthy males were divided equally into an IMT or placebo (PLA) group and {{before and after}} a 6 week intervention they undertook, on separate days, 1 h of (i) passive rest; and (ii) MSVV, whereby participants undertook volitional hyperpnea at rest that mimicked the breathing and respiratory muscle recruitment patterns commensurate with heavy cycling exercise. Plasma cytokines remained unchanged during passive rest. There was a main effect of time (P < 0. 01) for plasma interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) concentrations and a strong trend (P = 0. 067) for plasma interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist concentration during MSVV. Plasma IL- 6 concentration was reduced after IMT by 27 ± 18 % (main effect of intervention, P = 0. 029), whereas there was no change after PLA (P = 0. 753). There was no increase in a systemic marker of oxidative stress (DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMC), and diaphragm fatigue {{was not related to}} the increases in plasma IL- 1 β and IL- 6 concentrations. A dose-response relationship was observed between respiratory muscle work and minute ventilation and increases in plasma IL- 6 concentration. In conclusion, increases in plasma IL- 1 β and IL- 6 concentrations during MSVV were not due to diaphragm fatigue or DNA damage in PBMC. Increases in plasma IL- 6 concentration during MSVV are attenuated following IMT and the plasma IL- 6 response is dependent upon the level of respiratory muscle work and minute ventilation...|$|R

Two subject groups of 10 subjects each, one with anterior knee pain (PHY) and the other group with no history of patellofemoral pathology (NORM), performed the traditional straight leg raise (SLR) and a modified straight leg raise with external hip rotation (MOD). Each subject performed an isometric <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction and three trials of each of the two therapeutic exercises. The EMG variables analyzed were the percent of the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction for each muscle, vastus medialis oblique, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris: the percent of the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction of the ratio between the vastus medialis oblique and the vastus lateralis; the percent of the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction for the integrated EMG for each muscle; and the percent of the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction for the root mean square for each muscle. The statistical analysis was conducted with two-way analysis of variance procedures. The statistical analysis revealed no significant differences; however, the data appeared to illustrate a trend toward more electromyographical activity in the vastus medialis oblique in the PHY subject group during the MOD therapeutic exercise. This suggests that the MOD therapeutic exercise may be able to isolate the vastus medialis oblique muscle in persons with anterior knee pain and allow them to regain strength and normal function earlier than with the use of the SLR therapeutic exercise.

40|$|Introduction: Unlike large {{population}} studies about cardiovascular components {{and how they}} adapt to intensive physical activity, there is less research into the causes of enlargement of the respiratory system in athletes (e. g. vital capacity, maximum flow rates and pulmonary diffusion capacity). The purpose {{of this research was}} to study and compare pulmonary function in different types of sports and compare them with controls in order to find out which sports improve lung function the most. Materials and method: Pulmonary functional capacities, vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> (MVV) of 493 top athletes belonging to 15 different sports disciplines and of 16 sedentary individuals were studied. Pulmonary function test was performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines. Results: Basketball, water polo players and rowers had statistically higher vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) than the healthy sedentary control individuals. Football and volleyball players had lower VC while FVC was higher in the football group compared to controls. Peak expiratory flow was lower in boxing, kayak, rugby, handball, taekwondo and tennis. The <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>ventilation</b> (MVV) was significantly higher in water polo players and rowers. Boxers had statistically lower MVV than the controls. Players of other sports did not differ from the control group. Conclusion: The study suggests that specific type of training used in basketball, water polo or rowing could have potential for improving pulmonary function and rehabilitation.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify the {{characteristics}} and the lateral dominance of hand grip power and elbow flexion power. The subjects were 15 healthy young males (mean age 22. 1 ± 0. 7 yr, mean height 171. 3 ± 3. 4 cm, mean mass 64. 5 ± 4. 1 kg). All subjects were right-handed. Peak power was measured by both hands with 6 different loads of 20 %- 70 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction. The <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction of hand grip movement and elbow flexion movement was significantly larger in the dominant hand. Peak power of the dominant hand was larger in all loads in hand grip movement and in loads of 20 % and 30 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction in elbow flexion movement. In short, lateral dominance was confirmed. Peak power was significantly larger in hand grip movement than in elbow flexion movement in both hands. Peak velocity decreased with increasing loads in both movements, but peak power increased until about 50 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> contraction and then decreased. The peak power ratio of the dominant hand to the nondominant hand was significantly larger in hand grip movement than in elbow flexion movement in all loads and the peak power ratio in elbow flexion movement was more marked in light loads. In conclusion, both powers showed lateral dominance. Lateral dominance is more marked in hand grip power...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the dynamic {{characteristics}} of inertia‐induced cervical vertebral kinematics for both female and male volunteers in low‐speed rear impact conditions by comparing quasi‐static muscle‐induced neck kinematics. Two series of volunteer tests were used. One is data from a rear impact sled test series with 2 females and 4 males. The second set of data is from a voluntary neck bending test series with 4 females and 9 males. Cervical vertebral motions were measured by a cineradiography system. The same volunteers in the first test series also participated in the second test series. C 4 /C 5 through C 6 /C 7 showed larger extension angle in the peak S shape than <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> retraction for females. In contrast, the peak S shape was in the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> retraction for males. The rearward displacements at C 6 /C 7 in the peak S shape exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> extension for females. The vertebral angular displacement at C 5 /C 6 was greatest in the peak extension and exceeded the voluntary extension, especially for females. The vertebral normalised displacements in X‐direction at C 5 /C 6 and C 6 /C 7 showed larger rearward displacements in the peak extension than the voluntary extension, and exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>voluntary</b> extension for both genders...|$|R
