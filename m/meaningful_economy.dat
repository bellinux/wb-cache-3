Neste trabalho, realizou-se um estudo de caso de integraÃÃo energÃtica na etapa da extraÃÃo de uma fÃbrica de Ãleo de soja operando com produÃÃo mÃdia de 15. 000 toneladas/mÃs. Inicialmente avaliou-se as vazÃes, as temperaturas de entrada e saÃda e as capacidades calorÃficas de todas as correntes da etapa de extraÃÃo. ApÃs esta avaliaÃÃo, baseando-se no potencial de troca tÃrmica, foram selecionadas quatro correntes, sendo duas delas denominadas de correntes quentes e outras duas denominadas de correntes frias. A primeira corrente quente (Q 1), {{consiste}} em uma corrente de Ãleo bruto oriunda da etapa pÃs-separaÃÃo do solvente hexano, com temperatura de entrada de 110 ÂC e temperatura de saÃda de 80 ÂC. A segunda corrente quente (Q 2), consiste em uma corrente de Ãgua que sai de um aquecedor com temperatura de entrada de 90 ÂC e vai para a estaÃÃo de tratamento de efluentes, necessitando ser resfriada atÃ 55 ÂC. Essas duas correntes quentes tÃm um potencial de troca tÃrmica de 262, 8 kW/h. A terceira corrente, denominada de corrente fria F 1, consiste em uma corrente de Ãgua que sai do decantador a 40 ÂC, e entra no aquecedor para atingir a temperatura de saÃda de 90 ÂC, onde hexano residual Ã evaporado. A quarta corrente, denominada de corrente fria F 2, consiste em uma mistura de 70 % Ãleo e 30 % hexano com temperaturas de entrada de 60 ÂC e de saÃda de 90 ÂC. Essas duas correntes (F 1 e F 2) tem uma necessidade tÃrmica para seu aquecimento de 330 kW. A metodologia de sÃntese adotada para a sÃntese da rede de trocadores de calor, devido Ã facilidade de aplicaÃÃo e interaÃÃo com o usuÃrio, foi a AnÃlise Pinch. No procedimento de sÃntese, inicialmente Ã construÃda a tabela do problema onde identificou-se o ponto de estrangulamento energÃtico, ou ponto Pinch, obtendo-se assim as metas de consumo de utilidades para a mÃxima recuperaÃÃo de energia. ApÃs esta etapa, o problema foi dividido em duas regiÃes: abaixo e acima do Pinch, sendo realizada a sÃntese da rede. No caso estudado, toda a troca tÃrmica ocorre na regiÃo acima do Pinch. Assim, apÃs a sÃntese e otimizaÃÃo da rede, calculou-se o custo total anual. A rede proposta consiste em 2 trocadores de calor e dois aquecedores, sendo que um trocador realiza troca tÃrmica entre a corrente Q 1 (Ãleo bruto) e a corrente F 2 (a miscela), e o segundo trocador realiza troca entre a corrente Q 2 (Ãgua na saÃda do aquecedor) e a corrente F 1 (Ãgua na saÃda do decantador). O aquecimento complementar para as correntes frias atingirem suas temperaturas finais, Ã provido pelos aquecedores jÃ existentes na linha. A economia gerada pela reduÃÃo de consumo de utilidades foi de R$ 91. 000, 00 /ano, o que representa uma economia de consumo de vapor de 79, 6 %, acarretando uma reduÃÃo de 5, 3 % do consumo global de vapor da planta. O investimento necessÃrio para os dois trocadores de calor propostos na rede Ã de R$ 16. 540, 00, e avaliando-se o custo total anual, verifica-se uma reduÃÃo de R$ 114. 445, 00 para R$ 25. 800, 00, correspondendo a uma reduÃÃo de 77, 5 % no custo total anual, apÃs a sÃntese da rede. A taxa de retorno para o investimento proposto Ã de apenas 3 meses. Desta forma, confirma-se a eficiÃncia da AnÃlise Pinch na integraÃÃo energÃtica de processos, atingindo resultados significativos de economia de energia tÃrmica,contribuindo para processos industriais cada vez mais competitivos. In {{the process}} of soy oil the consumption of energy is extremely high, which is always important to create new alternatives to energetic consumption reduction. This paper is carried on {{a case study of}} energetic integration in a soy oil factory operating with an average production of 15. 000 tons/month. At first, the rate of flow, the input and output temperatures and the calorific capacity of all currents in the extraction phase were evaluated. After this assessment, based on the thermal potential change, four currents were selected, two denominated hot currents and two denominated cold currents. The first hot current (Q 1) consists of a crude oil current from the post-separation phase of the solvent hexane with the input temperature of 110 ÂC and output temperature of 80 ÂC. The second hot current (Q 2) consists of a water current coming out of a boiler with an input temperature of 90 ÂC and goes to the effluent treatment station having to be cooled to 55 ÂC. These two currents have a thermal potential change of 262, 8 kW/h. The third current denominated cold current F 1, consists of a water current that comes from the decanter with a input temperature of 40 ÂC and enters in the heater to reach an output temperature of 90 ÂC, where the residual hexane is evaporated. The fourth current, denominated cold current F 2, is a mixture of 70 % of oil and 30 % of hexane with an input temperature of 60 ÂC and output temperature of 90 ÂC. These two currents have a thermal necessity of 330 kW, for their heating. The synthesis methodology adopted for the heat exchangers network synthesis, due to the easiness in application and interaction with the user, was the Pinch Analysis. In the synthesis procedure, the Problem Table was developed and the Pinch Point was identified and the goals for the consumption of utilities were obtained for the maximum energy recovery. The problem was divided into two regions, below and above the Pinch Point. After the synthesis and optimization, the total cost for the network was calculated and all thermal exchange occurs above the Pinch Point. The proposed network consists of two heat exchangers and two boilers, so that a exchanger performs the thermal change between the Q 1 (crude oil) and Q 2 (miscela) currents. The second exchanger performs the change between Q 2 (the water in the boiler exit) and F 1 (water in the decanter exit) currents. The additional heating for the cold currents to reach final temperatures is provided by the boilers that are already being used in the factory. The economy generated by the reduction in the consumption of utilities was of R$ 91, 000. 00 /year, meaning a reduction of steam consumption of 79, 6 % and a reduction of 5, 3 % in the global consumption of the plant steam. The investment needed for the two proposed heat exchangers in the network, is R$ 16. 540, 00. Evaluating the year total cost, that includes the annual capital cost of the exchangers, an annual reduction of R$ 114. 445, 00 for R$ 25. 800, 00 is verified corresponding to 77. 5 % reduction in the annual total cost after the network synthesis. The return rate for the investment proposed is only 3 months. Therefore, Pinch Analysis is confirmed to be efficient in the energetic integration of processes reaching <b>meaningful</b> <b>economy</b> results in thermal energy, contributing for the industrial processes that are more and more competitive...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Treaty of Chaguaramas had prescribed that {{member states}} explore ways of harmonizing their monetary, exchange rate and payments {{policies in the}} interest of smooth functioning of the Common Market. Up to the late 1970s the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour the use of the member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme (or Intra-Regional Payments Scheme) was at first bilateral, but although it worked fairly well for about eight years it was limited, cumbersome and unwieldy as each participant had to keep individual accounts for all the other participants and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. In addition, the bilateral arrangements did not produce <b>meaningful</b> <b>economies</b> in the use of foreign exchange. The system finally became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. With the CMCF in place, intraregional trade doubled between 1978 and 1981, and the use of the credit facility of the CMCF expanded from US$40 million to US$100 million. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|R

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial distribution of fuel in cylinders is a key factor affecting the combustion characteristics and emission generation of a DI diesel engine. The airfuel mixing quality is critical for controlling ignition timing and combustion duration. Avoiding fuel-rich areas within the cylinder can significantly reduce soot formation as well as high local temperatures resulting in low NOx formation. The present investigation {{is focused on the}} effects of advanced fuel injections and air path strategies as well as the effects of piston geometry and fuel spray angle on air-fuel homogeneity, combustion process and their impacts on the performance and emission of the engine. A Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder engine in combination with AVL Fire CFD software was used in this investigation. An experimental analysis was conducted to assess the combustion characteristics and emissions formation of the engine under various injection strategies such as different injection timing, quantity, ratio, dwell angles between injections with various exhaust valve opening times and exhaust back pressures. A quan- titative factor named Homogeneity Factor (HF) was employed in the CFD code in order to quantify the air-fuel mixing and understand how the air-fuel homogeneity within the cylinder can influence the combustion and emissions of the engine. The investigation concludes that multiple injection strategies have the potential to reduce diesel emissions while maintaining <b>meaningful</b> fuel <b>economy.</b> Split injection can be used to improve the air-fuel mixture locally and control temperature generation during the start of combustion. Increased air-fuel homogeneity results in fewer fuel-rich areas within the cylinder and contributes to the reduction of soot emission. Extending the pre-mixed combustion phase has a direct effect on the reduction of soot formation while NOx generation is highly dependent on the scale of the primary fuel injection event...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect size}} of wearing sports garments treated with microscopic titanium particles (AQUA TITAN) during recovery from strenuous running on the restoration of running economy during subsequent exercise. Design: A double-blind crossover was used to {{determine the}} effect of AQUA TITAN on running metabolic cost in 10 healthy men. Participants performed 40 min of treadmill running comprising 2 נ(10 min at 5 % and 10 min at - 10 % grade), followed by random allocation to skin-tight nylon-polyurethane AQUA TITAN treated or non-treated placebo garments covering the torso, limbs, and feet. Garments were worn continuously throughout the next 48 -h, during which time participants rested (day 2) then completed a graded treadmill run to determine metabolic outcome (day 3). Methods: Body-weight normalised running metabolic cost was evaluated by indirect calorimetry and the effect size referenced against the smallest <b>meaningful</b> change in <b>economy</b> (0. 9 %) for improvement in distance running performance. Results: The fatigue effect while wearing control garments on metabolic cost at 48 -h was small (2. 2 % 95 %CL ᱮ 2 %). In contrast, AQUA TITAN garments most certainly reduced running metabolic cost (- 3. 1 % ᰮ 9 %) vs. control. Additionally, AQUA TITAN increased the respiratory exchange ratio (0. 011 ᰮ 005) and lowered minute ventilation at intensities below the ventilatory threshold (- 4. 0 % ᰮ 9 %). Conclusions: AQUA TITAN garments worn during recovery from strenuous exercise improved subsequent running economy to a magnitude likely to restore endurance performance. Future research should verify the magnitude of garment effects on performance outcomes, and on identifying the acute or passive neural, musculotendinous or metabolic mechanisms responsible. 頲 013 Sports Medicine Australia.
