40|$|The {{mechanical}} integrity of resorbable implants during service, especially in load bearing orthopaedic applications, is critical. The high degradation rate of resorbable magnesium and magnesium-based implants in body fluid may potentially cause premature in-service failure. In this study, a magnesium alloy (AZ 91) was potentiostatically coated with hydroxyapatite at different cathodic voltages {{in an attempt}} to enhance the {{mechanical integrity}}. The mechanical integrity of the uncoated and hydroxyapatite coated alloys was evaluated after in vitro testing of the coated samples in simulated body fluid (SBF). The uncoated alloy showed 40 % loss in the mechanical strength after five days exposure to SBF. However, the hydroxyapatite coated alloy exposed to SBF showed 20 % improvement in the mechanical strength as compared to that of the uncoated alloy. The alloy coated potentiostatically at − 2 V performed better than the − 3 V coated alloy. The cross-sectional analysis of the coatings revealed relatively uniform coating thickness for the − 2 V coated alloy, whereas the − 3 V coated alloy exhibited areas of uneven coating. This {{can be attributed to the}} increase in hydrogen evolution on the alloy during − 3 V coating as compared to − 2 V coating.

Magnesium alloys are biocompatible, lightweight and have good mechanical properties. The poor corrosion resistance of <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> can be advantageously used as biodegradable implants. However, the key issue is that, magnesium corrosion is too high in the physiological system which deteriorates the mechanical integrity of the alloy very rapidly. This study explores the possibility of enhancing the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloy (AZ 31) through laser treatment, which has an advantage of unaltering the bulk chemical composition and thus the mechanical property is not compromised. Electrochemical polarisation experiments, showed increment in general corrosion resistance for laser treated alloy. High pitting corrosion resistance of laser treated alloy was observed in the salt spray tests. The stress corrosion cracking resistance was also significantly higher in the laser treated alloy as compared to the untreated alloy. The higher corrosion resistance in the laser treated alloy is attributed to the fine grain size, uniform distribution of the secondary phase particles along the grain boundary and aluminium enrichment on the surface.

These alloys are considered to be the most promising materials for hydrogen-storage because of their high hydrogen-storage capacity, light weight, abundance of the constituents in the earth 2 ̆ 7 s crust, and low-cost compared with alternative systems. Of all the <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys,</b> Mg 2 Ni is the most remarkable due to its relative highcapacity and favourable kinetics. Nevertheless, <b>magnesium-based</b> hydrogen storage <b>alloys</b> have never been used as electrode materials in Ni-MH secondary batteries because of their sluggish hydriding-dehydriding kinetics and poor corrosion resistance in alkaline aqueous solution. Numerous investigations have been conducted in order to improve the kinetics of hydriding and dehydriding of <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> at ambient temperature. Nevertheless, all of these investigations have been concentrated only on the hydriding and dehydriding characteristics of <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> in the gas phase. As yet, no work has been directed towards the electrochemical performance of magnesium based alloys in an alkaline solution. The aims of this study are to exploit the feasibility of utilizing <b>magnesium-based</b> hydrogen storage <b>alloys</b> as low cost and high performance anode materials for the secondary battery. For this purpose, Mg 2 Ni alloy is made by using a vacuum powder-metallurgical method. The electrode behaviour of this alloy in 6 M KOH solution are investigated at room temperature. The experimental discharge capacityof Mg 2 Ni alloy electrode is only 8 mAh/g, which is almost negligible compared to theoretical electrochemical capacity (999 mAh/g). The reasons for this are discussed. Effect of alloy composition on the charge and discharge performance of Mg 2 Ni-type alloy electrodes is investigated, using Mg 1. 95 M 0. 05 Ni (M = Al, Ca, La, Ti and V) ternary alloys and Mgi. 9 Al 0. iNii. xYx (JC = 0 0. 3) quaternary alloys. The ternary have the same phase structure as the Mg 2 Ni binary does, but the unit cell volume Mg 1. 95 Mo. 05 Ni alloys increases linearly with the increasing radius of substituting elements. The discharge capacity improves with the ternary substituents studied the order Ca 3 ̆c La 3 ̆c Ti 3 ̆c V 3 ̆c Al. The addition of small amounts of aluminium orvanadium significantly improves the electrode capacity, which makes the specificcapacity more than double (from 8 mAh/g for Mg 2 Ni to 18 mAh/g for Mg 1. 95 Alo. 5 Ni and 17. 4 mAh/g for Mg 1. 95 V 0. 5 Ni, respectively). Titanium substitution seems also to increase effectively the discharge capacity, while Ca and La have almost no positive effects on the electrode capacity. The value of; 2 ̆ 7 o increases with increasing radius substituted metals in the same order as the discharge capacity, which suggests that charge transfer is the rate-determining step for the dehydriding reaction of Mg 1. 95 M 0. 05 Ni alloys at this test condition. The Mgi. pAlo. iNi 1 -xYx (x = 0 0. 3) quaternary alloy electrodes exhibit a higher electrochemical capacity and better discharge rate performance than Mg 2 Ni. The discharge capacity and discharge rate characteristics of the electrodes are substantially improved with increasing x value Mg 1 - 9 Alo. 1 Nii-xYx. For the Mg 1. 9 Al 0. 3 Nio. 7 Y 0. 3 electrode, a discharge capacity of mAh/g at room temperature has been achieved. However, an increase in the yttrium content leads to a decrease of cycle life of the electrodes. The discharge process of Mg 2 Ni-type hydrogen storage alloy electrodes is characterized by ac impedance spectroscopy at various depths of discharge (DOD) in 6 M KOH solution at room-temperature. Comparative measurements also are performed on a LaNi 5 electrode. An equivalent circuit has been developed by simulating experimental impedance dispersion. The rate-determining step of discharge process for the <b>magnesium-based</b> hydrogen storage <b>alloy</b> electrodes is dependent on both the alloy compositions and depth of discharge. The unmodified Mg 2 Ni electrode has a high charge-transfer resistance and mass-transfer resistance compared to LaNi 5 electrode. Additions of yttrium and aluminium in Mg 2 Ni reduce considerably both resistances, thereby producing a remarkable improvement in the discharge capacity and rate-dischargeability. In order to obtain further improvments in the electrochemical performance of Mg 2 Ni type alloy electrodes at ambient temperature, the multicomponent Mg 2 Ni-based alloy(Mg 1. 9 Yo. 1 Nio. 9 Alo. 1) powder is modified by an ultrasound treatment in an alkaline solution and microencapsulation with Ni-P alloy coating by using a low-temperature electroless plating method. The electrode characteristics such as electrochemical capacity, high-rate dischargeability and cycle life are examined and compared with those of the electrode fabricated from the unmodified alloy powder. The surface modification with ultrasound treatment shows a remarkable increase of electrode capacity and high-rate discharge capability but has little influence on the cycle life. The electrode fabricated from the micro encapsulated alloy powder has a higher discharge capacity, better high-rate discharge capability and longer cycle life as A specific discharge capacity of 220 mAh/g was achieved for Ni-P coated Mg 1. 9 Yo. 1 Nio. 9 Alo. 1 at room temperature. The electrochemical performances of Mg 2 Ni-type alloy electrodes with and without surface modification are characterized using dc polarization and ac impedance technique, and their phase compositions and microstructures are characterised by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronmicroscopy. The surface microencapsulation of alloy powder are effective inimproving the electrode discharge performance, but seems to be ineffective inpreventing disintegration of the Mg 2 Ni-based alloy powder.

The candidate materials for such application should have mechanical properties ideally close to those of 316 L stainless steel which is the gold standard material for stent application in order to provide mechanical support to diseased arteries. Non-toxicity of the metal itself and its degradation products is another requirement as the material is absorbed by blood and cells. Based on the mentioned requirements, iron-based and <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> have been the investigated candidates for biodegradable stents. This article reviews the recent developments in the design and evaluation of metallic materials for biodegradable stents. It also introduces the new metallurgical processes which could be applied for the production of metallic biodegradable stents and their effect on the properties of the produced metals...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{biodegradable}} metal stents {{have been established}} and examined as substitutes for the currently-used long-lasting cardiovascular stents. Degradable metallic substances could theoretically change corrosion-resistant metals presently used for stent application {{as it has been}} presented that the role of stenting is short-term and inadequate to duration of 6 – 12 months after joining during which arterial makeover and curing occur. Even though corrosion is usually measured as a failure in metallurgy, the corrodibility of guaranteed metals can be an advantage for their use as degradable implants. The applicant materials for such function should have automatic properties preferably close to those of 316 L stainless steel. Non-toxicity of the metal itself and its ruin products is another condition as the stuff is immersed by blood and cells. Based on the mentioned necessities, iron-based and <b>magnesium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> have been the investigate candidate for biodegradable stents. Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has become known as a useful substitute to carotid endarterectomy and Nitinol stents are normally helpful in CAS. This article reviews the recent developments in the design and assessment of metallic material for biodegradable stents.
