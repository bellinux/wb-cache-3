The Technicolor production was filmed on location between September 26, 1937, and January 14, 1938, at Bidwell Park, Busch Gardens, and Lake Sherwood in California. Directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz, the film is about the legendary Robin Hood, a Saxon knight who opposes the corrupt and brutal Prince John and his Norman lords while good King Richard is away fighting in the Third Crusade. The king's ward, Maid Marian, initially opposes Robin, but later supports him after learning his true intentions of helping his oppressed people. [...] No <b>mere</b> <b>bystander</b> to events, Marian risks her life to save Robin by providing his men a plan for his escape. As defined by deHavilland, Marian is both a beautiful fairy-tale heroine and a spirited, intelligent woman [...] "whose actions are governed by her mind {{as well as her}} heart", according to author Judith Kass. The Adventures of Robin Hood was released on May 14, 1938, and was an immediate critical and commercial success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the secretion of IgA-class autoantibodies that target tissue transglutaminase (tTG). It is now recognized that anti-tTG antibodies are functional and not <b>mere</b> <b>bystanders</b> in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Here we report that interaction between anti-tTG antibodies and extracellular membrane-bound tTG inhibits peptide 31 - 43 (but not peptide 57 - 68) uptake by cells, thereby impairing the ability of p 31 - 43 to drive Caco- 2 cells into S-phase. This effect did not involve tTG catalytic activity. Because anti-tTG antibodies interfered with epidermal growth factor endocytosis, we assume that they exert their effect by reducing peptide 31 - 43 endocytosis. Our results suggest that cell-surface tTG plays a hitherto unknown role in the regulation of gliadin peptide uptake and endocytosis...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} antigen-mediated capillary blot technique {{was developed for}} the detection of virus-specific oligoclonal IgG in paired CSF and serum samples from patients with various neurological diseases. In multiple sclerosis, intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal antibodies was present against measles (70 %), rubella (60 %), varicella zoster (40 %) and mumps (30 %); in most cases (75 %), such synthesis involved two or more viruses. In contrast, antibodies against a non-neurotropic virus (cytomegalovirus) were rarely produced in CSF from MS patients (5 %). However, this 'polyspecific' reaction was not restricted to MS samples but was also observed in neurolupus and in the late phase of infectious diseases of the central nervous system. These anti-viral antibodies could be produced without de novo replication of the corresponding viral genome and are likely <b>mere</b> <b>bystanders</b> of an ongoing immune response...|$|R
40|$|In {{celiac disease}} (CD), gluten, the disease-inducing toxic {{component}} in wheat, induces the secretion of IgA-class autoantibodies which target tissue transglutaminase (tTG). These autoantibodies are {{produced in the}} small-intestinal mucosa, and, during gluten consumption, {{they can also be}} detected in patients' serum but disappear slowly from the circulation on a gluten-free diet. Interestingly, after adoption of a gluten-free diet the serum autoantibodies disappear from the circulation more rapidly than the small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits. The finding of IgA deposits on extracellular tTG in the liver, kidney, lymph nodes and muscles of patients with CD indicates that tTG is accessible to the gut-derived autoantibodies. Although the specific autoantibody response directed against tTG is very characteristic in celiac patients, their role in the immunopathology of the celiac mucosal lesion is a matter of debate. Here we report a brief summary of anti-tTG antibody effects demonstrating that these antibodies are functional and not <b>mere</b> <b>bystanders</b> in the disease pathogenesis. In fact, they inhibit intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, induce intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, increase epithelial permeability and activate monocytes and disturb angiogenesis...|$|R

50|$|In this respect, {{it may be}} of {{interest}} that Mommsen—at the time employed by the Munich-based Institute for Contemporary History—was the first historian in the early 1960s to accept the conclusions of the journalist Fritz Tobias who argued in a 1961 book The Reichstag Fire that the Reichstag fire of 1933 was not started by the Nazis and that Marinus van der Lubbe had acted alone. Until the publication of Tobias's book, it was generally accepted both in West Germany and abroad that the fire was instigated by the Nazis {{as part of a}} plot to abolish democracy. The Nazi Machtergreifung (Seizure of Power) had been generally represented as part of a well-planned, totalitarian assault on democracy with the German people as hapless bystanders.

40|$|Context: Under morphogenesis-inducing conditions, Candida spp. {{begins to}} undergo yeast-to-hypha switch. This shift from {{commensal}} to pathogenic state {{is dependent on}} several virulence factors. Aim: To {{find out whether the}} isolated Candida spp. were pathogens causing vulvovaginal candidiasis or <b>mere</b> <b>bystanders.</b> Settings and Design: Cross-sectional observational study conducted on 275 symptomatic hospital patients in Tripura between August 2012 and April 2015. Subjects and Methods: Discharge was collected from patients and identified by Grams staining and wet mount test. Culturing was done in Sabouraud dextrose agar followed by speciation. To test for virulence factors, assays for adherence, plasma coagulase, phospholipase, lipase, protease, hemolysin, and biofilm formation were carried out. Statistical Analysis Used: Significance between two groups was compared using one-way analysis of variance along with Tukey test, and Chi-square 2 × 2 contingency table at 95 % confidence interval. Results: Fifty-six Candida spp. could be isolated in the study which was used for further virulence tests. One hundred percent of isolates expressed adherence. Among other virulence factors, maximum virulence 25 (45 %) was shown through protease production. Hemolysin production and biofilm formation were the second most 22 (39 %) expressed virulence factors. In a comparison of virulence factors between biofilm-forming isolates and planktonic cells, significant difference was seen for plasma coagulase and hemolysin production. Conclusions: All the isolates expressed one or more virulence factors. Adherence was expressed in all isolates but highest number was observed for Candida albicans. Furthermore, C. albicans strain number was highest for protease, hemolysin and coagulase expression and biofilm formation. Candida krusei isolates were the least in number for expressing any of the virulence factors. Significantly higher number of biofilm forming isolates produced hemolysin and coagulase in comparison to planktonic cells...|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} this research seeks to address {{is how the}} UN has tried to create legitimate governments in territories they administered, specifically in East Timor (UNTAET) and Kosovo (UNMIK). In short, {{this means that the}} instrument of transitional administration has been analyzed critically in view of the goal of creating legitimate government. This was to contribute to a major debate on interventions and statebuilding. By offering an innovative approach, it is shown (once more) that the international community should rid itself of the ‘global governance norm’ to intervene into (post-conflict) countries with the goal of building democracies and stable governments. This does not produce desired results. In the first chapter, the problem is conceptualized. Literature on the topic is reviewed and current debates analyzed. At the same time, the research question and innovative approach of this research is highlighted in view of the current academic discussion on interventions and statebuilding. In the second chapter the concept of legitimacy is analyzed meticulously, thereby making it the theoretical core of this thesis. Past and current templates for statebuilding are too much rooted in a Western (Weberian) rational-legal conception of legitimacy, thereby focusing on elections, good and/or effective government, and economic growth. However, it is found that legitimacy has contextualized validity, meaning that it is subject to space and time. In other words, a legitimate relation of power, of domination, is legitimate because of the values and norms underpinning it. Rules in society are accepted because they can be justified on shared beliefs. In addition, analysis and reconsideration of state formation showed that for rule to become legitimate, interaction between ruler and ruled is crucial. The constituency, the ruled, need {{to have some sort of}} ownership of the created structures of power. They need to vest their interest into those structures in order to participate and uphold them. Hence, several authors point to the mutual transformative relationship and interaction between state and society, between the central and the local level, forces top-down and bottom-up. It was thus concluded that creating political legitimacy, or rather legitimate government, was an exchange process between ruler and ruled, taking into account context, that is, historical and cultural factors, and people’s interests. In the third and fourth chapter, there is description and analysis of the activities of the UN in East Timor and Kosovo respectively. Here, the most remarkable finding is the top-down nature of implementing the new governmental structures by the UN, without agency of the people in those countries, meaning without significant local participation. Equally, both administrations favored a Western rational-legal governmental structure. In fact, democracy was implemented with elections as the main legitimizing principle, thereby neglecting existing structures of governance, power-sharing, and local values and norms. In the fifth and final chapter, it is concluded that those newly created governments in East Timor and Kosovo are not legitimate, since the values and norms underpinning them have failed to take root. The principles that should legitimize the new power structures are absent. Equally, the constituencies were often <b>mere</b> <b>bystanders,</b> indicating severe deficiency of interaction between ruler and ruled. As a result, those people have not invested in these new governmental structures, and thus have no interest in upholding or participating in them. The analysis presented in this thesis shows that temporarily acting as government, the instrument of transitional administration, does not create legitimate government. This fundamental contradiction cannot be resolved...|$|R

40|$|Myelin {{oligodendrocyte}} glycoprotein (MOG), {{a member}} of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, is a myelin protein solely expressed at the outermost surface of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocyte membranes. This makes MOG a potential target of cellular and humoral immune responses in inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Due to its late postnatal developmental expression, MOG is an important marker for oligodendrocyte maturation. Discovered about 30 [*]years ago, {{it is one of the}} best-studied autoantigens for experimental autoimmune models for multiple sclerosis (MS). Human studies, however, have yielded controversial results on the role of MOG, especially MOG antibodies (Abs), as a biomarker in MS. But with improved detection methods using different expression systems to detect Abs in patients’ samples, this is meanwhile no longer the case. Using cell-based assays with recombinant full-length, conformationally intact MOG, several recent studies have revealed that MOG Abs can be found in a subset of predominantly pediatric patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) seronegative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), monophasic or recurrent isolated optic neuritis (ON), or transverse myelitis, in atypical MS and in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-encephalitis with overlapping demyelinating syndromes. Whereas MOG Abs are only transiently observed in monophasic diseases such as ADEM and their decline is associated with a favorable outcome, they are persistent in multiphasic ADEM, NMOSD, recurrent ON, or myelitis. Due to distinct clinical features within these diseases it is controversially disputed to classify MOG Ab-positive cases as a new disease entity. Neuropathologically, the presence of MOG Abs is characterized by MS-typical demyelination and oligodendrocyte pathology associated with Abs and complement. However, it remains unclear whether MOG Abs are a <b>mere</b> inflammatory <b>bystander</b> effect or truly pathogenetic. This article provides deeper insight into recent developments, the clinical relevance of MOG Abs and their role in the immunpathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating disorders...|$|R

The use of scenarios in this way was generally found to be helpful by the parents. Examining scenarios for both parent and organisation learning, a learning framework was devised with two levels of change: a shallow learning change to the behaviour, and a deeper learning change to the underlying values that drive the behaviour. Scenarios provide the perspective needed to determine the appropriate level of adaptation needed.

40|$| 2) A pure {{sample of}} 7 {{crystallized}} along pathway 1 in two enantiotropic modifications, one obtained {{at room temperature}} (form) and the other at 20 C 0 (form) [Figure 2]. Behaving much like a temperature guided molecular switch, the tetraacetate 7 could be shifted reversibly between the forms response {{to changes in the}} ambient temperature. Thus, the form converted at - 4 OC to the denser form, which displayed an unusual kinetic stability till 67 OC and transformed back to the form beyond this temperature. Subsequently, the close similarity between the self-assemble of the two dimonrphs of 7 and the diastereomer 11 was exploited in order to stimulated 7 to fallow the pathway 2 through preferential inhibition of pathway 1 [Figure 3]. Interstingly, the nucleation inhibition 11 was obtained serendipitously a route 7 via an apparent breakdownof furst-platter rule. Unlike the tetraceatate 7, crystal packing in the tetrabenzoate 8 preferred to fallow exclusively pathway 2. The individualistic nature of the self-assemblies of 7 and 8 found to be in contrast commonalities noted in the mode of molecular assembly in 9 and 10 both of which conformed to a combination of pathway 1 and 2. A rationale for the preferred crystallization pathway of the four estes 7 - 10 as well as probable mechanism for the observed reversible transformation between the forms the tetracetate 7 will be put forth in this chapter.

In light of the wide ranging application of organofluorine compounds and the ambiguity that resides over the disposition of fluorine as a H-bond accepter, the third chapter utilizes three specially designed fluorinated polycyclitols 12 - 14 investigate the role of covalently bonded flurine in crystal structures of lesser studied aliphatic fluorous substracts and probe its capacity to engage itself in C(sp 3) -F…H-X(sp 3) (X=O and/or C) H-bounding, in presence of its isostere, the hydrozyl group. Conformatonality locked with well defined spatial disposition of functional groups, all the fluorinated polycyclitols 12 - 14 bear a fluorohydrin moiety, embedded in a rigid trans-decalin framework. In 12 and 14, it was conceived that the presence of a hydroxyl donor in a favorable 1, 3 -syndiaxial relationship to a fluoro group {{on one side and a}} hydroxyl group on the other would allow an unambiguous comparison between the two isoteric functionalities (C-OH and C-F) to serve as acceptors for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (O-H…O and purported O-H…F respectively) The difluorodiol 13 was sought to serve as a control to assess the change in the C-F…H-X interactions (if any) which might be observed upon incorporating the peripheral secondary hydroxyl groups in 14. The result presented in this chapter will revel, in particular, that C(sp 3) –F…H-C(sp 3) hydrogen bonds, though weak and lesser investigated, can indeed be observed and supramolecular recognition motifs, involving such interactions, can be conserved even in crystal structures laden with stronger O-H…O hydrogen bonds [Figure 4 }. Figure 4. (Left) Molecular packing in the difluorodiol 13, showing how four intermolecular C-H…F hydrogen bonds forms a part of a R 22 H-bonding motif (encircled).

The forth chapter details an in-depth study carried out on the self-assembly of a conformationally locked aminoalchohol 15, in which the amino protons serve as mere spectators, the molecular packing in the crystal being realized through the co-operativity between O-H…N H-bonds and weak π-π stacking interaction (Figure 5 b). The crystal structure of 15 was quite intriguing on three sailent grounds (a) previous studies on the supramolecular assemblies in the aminols have shown that both amino and hydroxyl protons participate in H-bonding in the crystal structures of such compounds; (b) the fact that the hydrogen atoms of the NH 2 group Figure 5.

Charge destiny analysis was carried out on the aminoalcoholf 15 not only to catheterize the non-covalent interactions existing in the supramolecular assembly in terms of topological features of electrol destiny at their bond critical points, but also to confirm the non-involvement of the amino H-atoms in any form of either intra- or intermoalecular hydrogen bonds beyond the criteria of mere geometry (Figure a,c,d). The maverick nature of the self-assembly of 15 was elucidated as resulting from the preference of the molecules to assemble with O-H…N H-bonds. This automatically relegated the hydrogen atoms of the tertiary amine to the interior of the conformationally locked cabocycclic scaffold, thereby making them far less accessible than the peripheral C=C bonds...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesIn {{the last}} three decades, {{there has been a}} phenomenon, akin to a {{revolution}} sweeping through the world, leaving in its wake major consequences of economic, political, legal and constitutional dimensions. The role of the state as we know it has been reconstructed beyond recognition. From an all-encompassing monolith that owns, manages, and provides various infrastructures, goods and services directly to the public and also serves as a regulator, it has now been reduced to a <b>mere</b> <b>bystander</b> or an enabler. Its footprints in the sands of economic and political times have diminished. In its place has arisen the regulatory state, characterised by a thinning out of the state; and the emergence of an institutional innovation: the Independent Regulatory Agency. Its rise, growth and diffusion across jurisdictions and sectors, and most recently in developing countries including Nigeria have been unprecedented. This thesis centres on the question whether the Independent Regulatory Agency can function in Nigeria in a manner analogous to its counterparts in the developed economies and be able to ensure the provision of safe, affordable and efficient infrastructures and services. The thesis finds institutional fragility, limited capacity, information asymmetry, corruption and insecurity within critical political, economic and supporting institutions that ideally gives life and legitimacy to the IRA; while essential democratic concepts are adhered to more in the breach. These challenges present a difficult climate in which the Independent Regulatory Agency can thrive. As an alternative, the thesis advocates the adoption of two transitory regulatory models: regulatory contracts and contracting out or outsourcing of functions. Their utilisation would achieve the desired regulatory outcomes until maturity is attained in the political economy of Nigeria, while simultaneously mitigating its contextual limitations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of dementia, {{characterized}} by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. However, despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive. METHODS: To elucidate molecular systems associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple measures of the severity of neuropathological lesions associated with AD (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression networks. We rank-ordered 44, 692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits. RESULTS: The neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and unlikely to be <b>mere</b> <b>bystander</b> result of degeneration; several modules were closely linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive compromise and development of the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} bystander {{norms of}} disinterest and blame that inform and undermine strategies {{for dealing with}} significant social problems such as domestic violence. Current strategies rely on individual “empowerment” to reduce such violence. These strategies reflect fundamental misconceptions and false assumptions {{about the nature of}} domestic violence, about why this sort of violence persists so stubbornly, and, ultimately, about what it takes to change behavior that has long been tolerated, if not actually fostered, as a result of deeply imbedded social and cultural norms. The net effect is that far from empowering abused women, let alone reaching the norms that have made this form of abuse such an intractable problem, the so-called empowerment approach instead perpetuates the traditional view of domestic violence as a private matter, properly the business of no one except the two intimates themselves. Everyone else is a <b>mere</b> <b>bystander.</b> The responsibility for ending domestic violence is squarely placed in the hands of its (supposedly) now-empowered victims: it is up to each individual battered woman to end the violence against her; if she fails she has only herself to blame. Drawing on the literature on norms and the law, we analyze how successful norm-changing strategies in other contexts suggest a different and more effective approach to the problem of domestic violence. The conscious change of tactics in anti-smoking campaigns from a focus on protecting the smoker to a focus on protecting non-smokers has resulted in a surprisingly rapid change in cultural norms about smoking. Lessons drawn from that campaign suggest new strategies for coping with domestic violence. The Article concludes that given the financial and personal negative effects of domestic violence on third parties, norm changing strategies that rely, not on notions of individual empowerment and autonomy, but rather on strategies grounded in the idea that domestic violence is a community problem that affects us all, {{are far more likely to}} have an impact on reducing intimate violence. Such norm-changing strategies transform the bystander into an interested party...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{responsibilities}} of Security Council members for abuses perpetrated in foreign humanitarian crises. As death tolls mount and massive {{violations of human rights}} continue in Syria, the Security Council plods along, doing little to respond to the escalating violence there. Some have portrayed the Council as a <b>mere</b> <b>bystander,</b> an onlooker with no connection to or responsibility for the atrocities undertaken by others. In another view, the Council is not merely standing by, but instead is complicit in the violence because it does nothing. Drawing on insights from the criminal law, this essay considers how we can better understand {{what it means to be}} a bystander in the context of humanitarian crises. Specifically, this essay examines two questions. First, it considers whether the resistance of Anglo-American criminal law to bystander liability should be replicated in the context of international affairs. Investigating the rationales for limited bystander liability in criminal law and the distinct rationales present in international law, this essay argues that even though the responsibility of the Security Council for international peace and security provides a strong reason for placing heightened expectations on the Council in the event of humanitarian crises, distinct concerns in international law caution against treating Council members as obligated to intervene in foreign states. Second, this essay draws on the criminal law distinction between acts and omissions to explore whether Security Council conduct in the context of humanitarian crises should properly be labeled participation or inaction. I contend that in light of the Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s defined role under the U. N. Charter, a lack of involvement on the part of the Council should be understood as an affirmative choice, rather than as a failure to act. Exploring the broader moral intuitions of both criminal law and international law about the conduct of certain actors toward suffering caused by third parties, this essay seeks to illuminate some assumptions at work in our understanding of the Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s role in humanitarian crises, thus furthering debates about the Council and humanitarian intervention, a crucial question in contemporary international law and politics...|$|E
