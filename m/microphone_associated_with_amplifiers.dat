50|$|The {{special feature}} among tetrodes and pentodes is the {{possibility}} to obtain ultra-linear or distributed load operation with an appropriate output transformer. In practice, in addition to loading the plate terminal, distributed loading (of which ultra linear circuit is a specific form) distributes the load also to cathode and screen terminals of the tube. An Ultra-linear connection and distributed loading are both in essence negative feedback methods, which enable less harmonic distortion along <b>with</b> other characteristics <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> negative feedback. Ultra-linear topology has mostly been <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuits based on research by D. Hafler and H. Keroes of Dynaco fame.

40|$|Bilateral {{cochlear}} implant (BI-CI) recipients achieve high word recognition scores in quiet listening conditions. Still, {{there is a}} substantial drop in speech recognition performance when there is reverberation and more than one interferers. BI-CI users utilize information from just two directional microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} head in a so-called independent stimulation mode. To enhance the ability of BI-CI users to communicate in noise, the use of two computationally inexpensive multi-microphone adaptive noise reduction strategies exploiting information simultaneously collected by the <b>microphones</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> two behind-the-ear (BTE) processors (one per ear) is proposed. To this end, as many as four microphones are employed (two omni-directional and two directional) in each of the two BTE processors (one per ear). In the proposed two-microphone binaural strategies, all four microphones (two behind each ear) are being used in a coordinated stimulation mode. The hypothesis is that such strategies combine spatial information from all microphones to form a better representation of the target than that made available with only a single input. Speech intelligibility is assessed in BI-CI listeners using IEEE sentences corrupted by up to three steady speech-shaped noise sources. Results indicate that multi-microphone strategies improve speech understanding in single- and multi-noise source scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The CEBAF {{injector}} includes 22 RF control modules {{which require}} an intermediate frequency (IF) of 70 MHz {{and a local}} oscillator (LO) frequency of 1427 MHz. A STAR network distributes the signals over coaxial cables that are of equal length so that all systems see the same phase drifts due to ambient temperature changes. To obtain the signal levels required by the individual RF control modules, amplifiers are used in both the LO and IF distribution.

The first step of an acoustic diagnosis is the source localization which can be performed with a microphone array. Spherical microphone arrays {{can be used to}} detect the acoustic source positions in a workplace. In this study, a spherical microphone array, with polyhedral discretization, is proposed and compared with a spherical array with a slightly different geometry. The generalized cross-correlation technique is used to detect the source positions. Moreover, two criteria are introduced to improve the noise source map. The first is based on the geometric properties of the microphone array and the scan zone whereas the second is based on the energy of the spatial likelihood function. Numerical data are used to provide a systematic comparison of both geometries and criteria.

50|$|In general, the {{configuration}} will usually provide higher measured distortion performance compared to high feedback amplifiers. This distortion is predominantly second harmonic {{which is not}} unpleasant to the ear (the second harmonic for an A on the musical scale at 440 Hz is 880 Hz which is, obviously, also an A i.e., the same note just an octave higher), but by definition their high THD figures make SET amplifiers inaccurate. In a push pull amplifier this second harmonic distortion is cancelled in the output transformer. Several percent THD is not unusual at full power output, but will be much lower at normal music levels. Some builders and users have concluded that while global feedback reduces distortion across the harmonic range, it also reduces the dramatic dynamics <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a SET <b>amplifier</b> and the highly efficient speaker needed to enjoy a low power amplifier, but this is also strongly debated.|$|R

Emphasis of this research is on development of a more general tuning scheme which can be applicable to various filter functions as well as high-frequency applications. The tuning scheme consists of two phases: system identification and adjustment. Various continuous-time filter identification methods including time-domain and frequency-domain approaches are investigated, and a filter adjustment algorithm is presented. Potential of high accuracy of the proposed tuning scheme and successful applicability to high-frequency filters with versatile functions have been demonstrated through simulations and experiments;Four other topics are separately presented. First, nonidealities <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> high-precision <b>amplifiers</b> (5), (7) are discussed. Special emphasis is given on analysis of statistical characteristics of random CMRR and offset of CMOS op-amps which can help estimating yield of high-volume production and help engineers design for a given yield. Next, an automatic offset compensation scheme for CMOS op-amps with ping-pong control (2), (6) is presented. A very low-voltage circuit design technique using floating gate MOSFETs (3) is introduced. Finally, an accurate and matching-free threshold voltage extraction scheme using a ratio-independent SC amplifier and a dynamic current mirror (1) is discussed...|$|R

Commercial systems depend typically on narrowband operation and exploit single element applicators to drive energy into treated tissue. In addition, monitoring of thermal distribution depends on invasive intraluminal or interstitial probes. This research aims at developing a proficient platform that addresses some challenges of hyperthermia therapy. A system is suggested that depends on multichannel wideband operation, and implements applicator array. The configuration of this system allows the control of energy localization at various depth of tumors. In addition, the information <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> scattered wideband signals allow performing nearfield imaging, to reconstruct tissue characteristics maps. To investigate system performance, a model is developed of the forward problem, incorporating dispersive wideband models of tissue properties. A tool is developed to generate a dictionary that relates scattered signals to material features. Solution of the inverse problem is conducted based on compressed sensing techniques. Orthogonal matching pursuit OMP models are developed to enhance the resolution of image reconstruction. With the dependence of tissue electrical properties on temperature, thermal maps are generated. Practical aspects of the nonlinearity <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> wideband power <b>amplifiers</b> are incorporated in the model.

40|$|Monosynaptic reflex {{pathways}} of {{the spinal}} cord are formed by the conjunction of afferent neurons and motoneurons. Normally action by the former leads to response of the latter.
