5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 April 2017, each {{potential}} candidate must submit a community declaration to the Community Committee. The Committee comprises a chairman, {{five members of}} the Chinese community (forming the Chinese Community Sub-Committee), {{five members of the}} Malay community (the Malay Community Sub-Committee), and five members of the Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> (the Indian and Other <b>Minority</b> <b>Communities</b> Sub-Committee). In a community declaration, potential candidates are required to state that they consider themselves a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities,</b> and wish to apply for a community certificate to this effect. Alternatively, they can state that they do not consider themselves {{to be a member of}} any of these communities. The period for submission of community declarations begins three months before the term of the incumbent President expires, and ends five days after the date of the writ of election.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{constitutional}} amendments made in 2016, {{a presidential election}} will be reserved for a community in Singapore if no one from that community has been President {{for any of the}} five most recent terms of office of the President. The communities are the Chinese community, the Malay community, and the Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities.</b> Candidates are required to satisfy the usual qualification criteria. The 2017 election was the first reserved election, and was reserved for the Malay community.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities.</b> During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E

5|$|Article 12(2) {{is subject}} to an express {{contrary}} authorization by the Constitution. Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure {{that members of the}} Malay, Indian and other <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, at least one of whom must be from a minority community. Article 39A(3) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2000 census other Christian <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> {{included}} Neo-Pietism (0.44%), Pentecostalism (0.28%, mostly {{incorporated in}} the Schweizer Pfingstmission), Methodism (0.13%), the New Apostolic Church (0.45%), Jehovah's Witnesses (0.28%), other Protestant denominations (0.20%), the Old Catholic Church (0.18%), other Christian denominations (0.20%). Non-Christian religions are Hinduism (0.38%), Buddhism (0.29%), Judaism (0.25%) and others (0.11%); 4.3% {{did not make a}} statement. 21.4% in 2012 declared themselves as unchurched i.e. not affiliated with any church or other religious body (Agnostic, Atheist, or just not related to any official religion).|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} is a non-reserved election, and the person applied for a community certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application. If the person submitted a community declaration that did not include an application for a community certificate, {{he or she must}} submit the Community Committee's written acceptance of the declaration and a statutory declaration that he or she does not consider himself or herself a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reactions to sectarian {{domination}} and abuse {{have resulted in}} accusations of sectarianism being levelled against the <b>minority</b> <b>community.</b> It has been argued, however, that those reactions would be better {{understood in terms of}} a struggle against the sectarianism that governs relations between the two communities and which has resulted in the denial of human rights to the <b>minority</b> <b>community.</b>|$|R

5|$|Several ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> have {{centred on}} Whitechapel Road. The road was {{a focal point}} of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, the street became an {{established}} settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes in the market and on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.|$|E
5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|The President, at the Cabinet's direction, {{declares}} {{the electoral}} divisions {{that are to}} be GRCs; the number of candidates (three to six) to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other <b>minority</b> <b>communities.</b> The number of GRCs in which at least one MP must be from the Malay community must be three-fifths {{of the total number of}} GRCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election. For the 2011 general election, there were 12 SMCs and 15 GRCs.|$|E

He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had {{paved the way for}} <b>minority</b> <b>communities</b> to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other <b>Minority</b> <b>Communities</b> Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
