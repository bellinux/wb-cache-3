5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased <b>maximum</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>weight</b> and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, {{the winner of}} which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar is an {{orthodox}} single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, {{it had a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>weight</b> in the 15 tonne class; and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000lb (4,500kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons, or alternatively British Aden cannons.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar <b>maximum</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>weight</b> to the Su-27M.|$|E

40|$|New {{costs of}} delay to the airline are {{presented}} {{for a range}} of aircraft and by phase of flight. It is shown how these costs may be suitable for cost optimisations during flight prioritisation decision-making. Desirable properties of prioritisation procedures are benchmarked against taxation principles. It is shown that <b>Maximum</b> <b>Take-Off</b> <b>Weights,</b> historically established as a charging mechanism in air transport, could actually be used in the context of determining flight prioritisations. Using non-linear delay costs is superior to the use of delay minutes in such optimisations and often produces more equitable solutions. Issues regarding the scale of solutions sought (e. g. by several flights or a whole network), and the implementation of truly dynamic cost optimisation, both require further research...|$|R

25|$|John Leahy {{estimates}} that the A330-900 will have operating costs on par with the 787-9, but {{will be available at}} 25% lower capital costs and can reach a production rate of 10 per month after a 7/8 per month rate at the production start.

50|$|Weight and Balance:When {{the weight}} of the {{aircraft}} is at or below the allowable limit(s) for its configuration (parked, ground movement, take-off, landing, etc.) and its center of gravity is within the allowable range, and both will remain so {{for the duration of the}} flight, the aircraft is said to be within weight and balance. Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations; for example, large aircraft may have maximum landing weights that are lower than <b>maximum</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>weights</b> (because some weight is expected to be lost as fuel is burned during the flight). The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft's weight changes due to fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin.|$|R
50|$|The maximum empty mass, MEmax, (WEmax) {{includes}} all operational equipment {{that is actually}} installed in the aeroplane. It includes the mass (weight) of the airframe, powerplant, required equipment, optional and specific equipment, fixed ballast, full engine coolant, hydraulic fluid, and the residual fuel and oil.

500|$|The A318 is {{available}} {{with a variety}} of different <b>maximum</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>weights</b> (MTOW) ranging from a , [...] base model to a , [...] version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 {{is available}} with a 123,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 is available with a 130,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes. The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London – New York, Perth–Auckland and Singapore–Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.|$|R
