50|$|<b>Mirodenafil</b> {{belongs to}} the drug class PDE5 inhibitors, which {{includes}} avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, udenafil, and vardenafil, and is the first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction. Developed by SK Chemicals Life Science, <b>mirodenafil</b> is marketed in Korea under the trade name Mvix, offered both as tablets (50 mg and 100 mg) and as orally dissolving film (50 mg).|$|E
50|$|Several {{clinical}} trials were conducted, but <b>mirodenafil</b> {{has not been}} approved {{for use in the}} United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of severe}} adverse effects and {{patients}} dissatisfaction with current therapy choices other inhibitors {{have recently been}} approved for clinical use. These inhibitors are udenfil, avanafil lodenafil and <b>mirodenafil.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>mirodenafil,</b> a phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor developed in South Korea, on the female rat bladder in a partial bladder outlet ob-struction (BOO) model. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the control group, BOO without medication group, BOO with <b>mirodenafil</b> 1 mg/kg group, and BOO with <b>mirodenafil</b> 4 mg/kg group. <b>Mirodenafil</b> was administered orally for 2 weeks after the induction of BOO. Two weeks after BOO, the rats in each group underwent cystometry under urethane anesthesia. After cystometry, the blad-der was excised to perform immunohistochemical staining for connexin 43. Results: The three BOO groups showed significant increases in mean bladder weight compared with the control group. Baseline pressure, threshold pressure, and maximum contraction pressure {{were not significantly different}} between the four groups. Although the contraction interval was decreased in all BOO groups compared with the control group, it was prolonged in the two groups treated with <b>mirodenafil</b> compared with the untreated BOO group. In the immunohistochemical examination, connexin 43 stainin...|$|E
40|$|Impotence {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{complications}} after the radical prostatectomy. One of the main reasons of this complication is due to the dysfunction of the veins in corpus cavernosum. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} erectile function is improved after the long-term therapy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor among patients with post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. In this study, we evaluated the effects of <b>mirodenafil</b> on the penile erection and corpus cavernosum tissues in the rat model of cavernosal nerve injury. Rats were divided into four groups: (1) control group, (2) bilateral cavernosal nerve injury group, (3) <b>mirodenafil</b> 10 [*]mg therapy group after the nerve injury and (4) <b>mirodenafil</b> 20 [*]mg therapy group after the nerve injury. After we identified the nerve from the pelvic nerve complex on the lateral side of the prostate, the rats in the control group were sutured without causing any nerve injury and in other groups we damaged the nerve by compressing it with a vessel clamp. Then, 10 and 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of <b>mirodenafil</b> were orally administered to two experimental groups. After 8 weeks, the intracavernosal pressure (ICP) was recorded. The immunohistochemical staining and western blot were performed, and the effect of <b>mirodenafil</b> on the expression of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was evaluated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ICP of nerve-injured group was decreased compared with the control group; however, the ICP of the mirodenafil-administered groups was improved compared with the nerve-injured group. The Masson's trichrome staining confirmed that the smooth muscle (SM) component was increased in the mirodenafil-administered groups. The nitric oxide synthase expression and cGMP of mirodenafil-administered groups was increased compared with the nerve-injured group. Long-term therapy of <b>mirodenafil</b> may improve the erectile function after the radical prostatectomy by preserving the SM content and inhibiting the fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen of the PDE- 5 inhibitors {{and their}} analogues were {{analyzed}} using GC-EI-MS. Fourteen {{of them could be}} identified by simple GC-MS method without derivatization, but hydroxyhongdenafil, hydroxyvardenafil, xanthoanthrafil and <b>mirodenafil</b> could not be identified without derivatization for the high polarity due to the presence of hydroxyl groups. N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA), widely used trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatizing reagents, were used to improve the sensitivity of the hydroxylated analogues. And the analytes could be identified by GC-MS after the derivatization...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of <b>mirodenafil</b> in middle-aged male patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight males with CP/CPPS were randomized to receive either levofloxacin (500 mg/d) (group L, 40 patients) or levofloxacin (500 mg/d) and <b>mirodenafil</b> (50 mg/d) (group ML, 48 patients) for six weeks. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI), and erectile function (EF) domain scores of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire were used to grade symptoms at baseline and 6 weeks after treatment. Results: The mean change in total IPSS from baseline was higher in group ML than that in group L (group L, − 1. 1 vs. group ML, − 4. 3; p＜ 0. 05). Significant improvements were also seen in the IPSS voiding subscore (group L, − 0. 7 vs. group ML, − 3. 0; p ＜ 0. 05). Changes observed in the NIH-CPSI of group ML at six weeks were greater than those at baseline (group L, − 3. 2 vs. group ML, − 7. 2; p＜ 0. 05). Significant improvements were seen in the NIH-CPSI voiding (group L, − 0. 5 vs. group ML, − 1. 7; p＜ 0. 05) and quality of life domains (group L, − 1. 0 vs. group ML, − 1. 8; p＜ 0. 05). Group ML showed a significantly greater increase i...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor therapy in 1998 revolutionized {{the treatment of}} erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction {{is the most common}} sexual problem in men. It often has a profound effect on intimate relationships and quality of life. The analysis of pharmaceuticals {{is an important part of}} the drug development process as well as for routine analysis and quality control of commercial formulations. Whereas the determination of sildenafil citrate, vardenafil and tadalafil are well documented by a variety of methods, there are few publications about the determination of udenafil, lodenafil carbonate, <b>mirodenafil</b> and avanafil. The paper presents a brief review of the action mechanism, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics and the most recent analytical methods that can determine drug concentration in biological matrices and pharmaceutical formulations of these four drugs...|$|E
40|$|Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are a {{group of}} ubiquitously present enzymes {{involved}} in regulation of various cellular pathways. PDE 5 acts to metabolize cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP). The various PDE 5 inhibitors available are sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and <b>mirodenafil.</b> We shall discuss the roles of various PDE 5 inhibitors in rheumatic diseases. PDE 5 inhibitors prevent degradation of cyclic GMP; hence, they have vasodilatory properties which render them useful {{in the management of}} secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. They have also demonstrated efficacy in the healing of digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis and potentially prevent the formation of new digital ulcers. Their vasodilatory property has also been utilized in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension, wherein their ability to favorably affect hemodynamics of a pressure-overloaded right heart is beneficial. Recent evidences have suggested a potential antifibrotic role of these agents, and studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease hold promise for future exploration of these agents for these indications...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} the prescriptions of alpha-blockers and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is) in the urology department {{as well as}} in other departments of the general hospital. Methods: We investigated the frequency of prescription of alpha-blockers and PDE 5 Is from 3 general hospitals from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. For alpha-blockers, data were collected from patients to whom alpha-blockers were prescribed from among patients recorded as having benign prostatic hyperplasia according to the 5 th Korean Standard Classification of Diseases. For PDE 5 Is, data were collected from patients to whom PDE 5 Is were prescribed by the urology department and by other departments. Alpha-blockers were classified into tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, whereas PDE 5 Is were classified into sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, udenafil, and <b>mirodenafil.</b> Results: Alpha-blockers were prescribed to 11, 436 patients in total over 3 years, and the total frequency of prescriptions was 68, 565. Among other departments, the nephrology department had the highest frequency of prescription of 3, 225 (4. 7 %), followed by the cardiology (3, 101, 4. 5 %), neurology (2, 576, 3. 8 %), endocrinology (2, 400, 3. 5 %), pulmonology (1, 102, 1. 6 %), and family medicine (915, 1. 3 %) departments in order. PDE 5 Is were prescribed to 2, 854 patients in total over 3 years, and the total frequency of prescriptions was 10, 558. The prescription frequency from the urology department was 4, 900 (46. 4 %). Among other departments, the endocrinology department showed the highest prescription frequency of 3, 488 (33. 0 %), followed by the neurology (542, 5. 1 %), cardiology (467, 4. 4 %), and family medicine (407, 3. 9 %) departments in order...|$|E
