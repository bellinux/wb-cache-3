40|$|Vasoactive agents which elevate either cGMP or cAMP inhibit {{platelet}} activation by pathways sharing {{at least one}} component, the 46 / 50 kDa vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (V ASP). V ASP is stoichiometrically phosphorylated by both cGMP-dependent and cAMPdependent protein kinases in intact human platelets, and its phosphorylation correlates very well with platelet inhibition caused by cGMP- and cAMP-elevating agents. Here we report that in human platelets spread on glass, V ASP is associated predominantly with the distal parts of radial micro filament bundles and with microfilaments outlining the periphery, whereas less V ASP {{is associated with a}} central <b>microfilamentous</b> <b>ring.</b> V ASP is also detectable in a variety of different cell types including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. In fibroblasts, V ASP is concentrated at focal contact areas, along microfilament bundles (stress fibres) in a punctate pattern, in the periphery of protruding lamellae, and is phosphorylated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases in response to appropriate stimuli. Evidence for the direct binding of V ASP to F -actin is also presented. The data demonstrate that V ASP is a novel phosphoprotein associated with actin filaments and focal contact areas, i. e. transmembrane junctions between microfilaments and the extracellular matrix...|$|E
