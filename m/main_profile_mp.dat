The bit rate reductions for HEVC were determined based on PSNR with HEVC having a bit rate reduction of 35.4% compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC HP, 63.7% compared with MPEG-4 ASP, 65.1% compared with H.263 HLP, and 70.8% compared with H.262/MPEG-2 MP.|$|E

There are seven sets of capabilities, {{referred to as}} profiles, targeting specific classes of applications: Baseline Profile (BP) for low-cost applications with limited computing resources, which is widely used in videoconferencing and mobile communications; <b>Main</b> <b>Profile</b> (<b>MP)</b> for broadcasting and storage applications; Extended Profile (XP) for streaming video with relatively high compression capability; High Profile (HiP) for high-definition television applications; High 10 Profile (Hi 10 P) going beyond present mainstream consumer product capabilities; High 4 [*]:[*] 4 [*]:[*] 2 Profile (Hi 422 P) targeting professional applications using interlaced video; High 4 [*]:[*] 4 [*]:[*] 4 Profile (Hi 444 P) supporting up to 12 bits per sample and efficient lossless region coding and an integer residual color transform for RGB video. The levels in H. 264 are defined as Level 1 to 5, {{each of which is}} for specific bit, frame and macroblock (MB) rates to be realized in different profiles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} the rate-distortion-complexity of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) reference video codec (HM) and compares the results with AVC reference codec (JM). The examined software codecs are HM 6. 0 using <b>Main</b> <b>Profile</b> (<b>MP)</b> and JM 18. 0 using High Profile (HiP). These codes are benchmarked under the all-intra (AI), random access (RA), lowdelay B (LB), and low-delay P (LP) coding configurations. In {{order to obtain}} a fair comparison, JM HiP anchor codec has been configured to conform to HM MP settings and coding configurations. The rate-distortion comparisons rely on objective quality assessments, i. e., bit rate differences for equal PSNR. The complexities of HM and JM have been profiled at the cycle level with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The coding efficiency of HEVC is drastically better than that of AVC. According to our experiments, the average bit rate decrements of HM MP over JM HiP are 23 %, 35 %, 40 %, and 35 % under the AI, RA, LB, and LP configurations, respectively. However, HM achieves its coding gain with a realistic overhead in complexity. Our profiling {{results show that the}} average software complexity ratios of HM MP and JM HiP encoders are 3. 2 × in the AI case, 1. 2 × in the RA case, 1. 5 × in the LB case, and 1. 3 × in the LP case. The respective ratios with HM MP and JM HiP decoders are 2. 0 ×, 1. 6 ×, 1. 5 ×, and 1. 4 ×. This paper also reveals the bottlenecks of HM codec and provides implementation guidelines for future real-time HEVC codecs...|$|E

30|$|In this article, a novel method {{based on}} sparse {{representation}} is developed to detect pavement cracks and reconstruct the <b>main</b> pavement <b>profile.</b> The key for cracks separation from <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> {{is based on}} the features of the mixed over-complete dictionary, which consists of two kinds of atoms, one for crack representation and another for <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> representation. In this study, atoms of trapezoidal membership function are adopted to represent crack, and exponential function for <b>main</b> pavement <b>profile.</b> Compared to the wavelet and median filtering method, the cracks extracted by our method can match the shape of crack very well, which cannot damage the information of the <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> signal. Some outdoor and accuracy experiments were conducted and promising results were obtained, showing that this method cannot only detect the position of pavement crack efficiently and achieve a good separation of crack from pavement profile, but also reconstruct <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> very well. Because MP is very time consuming when the greedy exhaustive search in the whole huge over-complete dictionary adopted and it is still a challenging problem. In the future work, we will use computer grid technology to improve computational efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Analyzing {{the results}} shown previously, some {{conclusions}} can be drawn. Both in baseline and <b>main</b> <b>profiles</b> the reduction in computational complexity is appreciable. The partial time saving (the time reduction measured only in the temporal layers where the proposal is applied) achieved is around 84 % for baseline and 87 % for the <b>main</b> <b>profile.</b> Regarding the total time saving (the time reduction measured over the whole sequence), a reduction of 65 % for baseline and 68 % for <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> is achieved. These time reductions are obtained without any significant increment in bitrate (in baseline profile between 0.28 % in the best case and 3.25 % in the worst one, and in <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> between 0.44 % and 2 % in the worst case). Regarding PSNR, the presented algorithm improves upon the PSNR obtained by the reference transcoder. This is possible because both the reference and proposed transcoder are encoded with the rate distortion optimization disable; so, the encoding performed by the reference {{is not the most}} optimized one.|$|R

30|$|For <b>profile</b> signal, the <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> {{signal is}} varying slowly, which spreads {{over the whole}} observing period; Crack signal has sharp edges and {{performs}} different shapes, which belongs to narrow-scale signal. Wavelets can detect the location of cracks accurately due to its good time-frequency characteristic, but the wavelet base is fixed which cannot match the crack shape well. So after analyzing the characteristics of <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> and cracking, we constructed a mixed over-complete dictionary according to <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> and crack characteristics and proposed a novel method based on sparse representation for crack detection and the mainly pavement profile extraction without noise. Some experiments were conducted and promising results were obtained, showing that we can detect the pavement crack accurately and achieve a good separation of crack from pavement profile.|$|R
