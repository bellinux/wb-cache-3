25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is <b>my</b> <b>wish</b> that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new Queen, Alexandra, insisted on {{replacing}} Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. This {{gave rise to a}} further breach between the royal ladies, with King Edward VII caught in the middle between his sister and his wife. Lady Roberts, a courtier, wrote to a friend: [...] "matters were sometimes very difficult and not always pleasant." [...] However, in accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra's favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve. Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime—"if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said, 'It is <b>my</b> <b>wish,</b> that is sufficient.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I think can be kind of the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is saying in the lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back on her feet and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / I live in the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make <b>my</b> <b>wish</b> come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E

Tiya agreed, advanced with his forces to meet the Tamils, and was vanquished by them. The Tamils, elated by their success, advanced towards Anuradhapura and defeated the King, who was forced to abandon the throne and go into hiding in the mountains. As the King, defeated in battle, was fleeing Anuradhapura, a Jain priest of Giri Monastery, which had been built by King Pandukhabaya near the northern gate of the city, cried out: [...] "The great black Sinhala is fleeing."

If I had <b>my</b> <b>wish,</b> I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.” Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, [...] "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so."
