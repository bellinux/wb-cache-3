5|$|According to Sugiura, <b>Monolith</b> Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and <b>Monolith</b> Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, <b>Monolith</b> Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided <b>Monolith</b> Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of <b>Monolith</b> Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of <b>Monolith</b> Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of <b>Monolith</b> Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of <b>Monolith</b> Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E

40|$|Polymethacrylate <b>monoliths,</b> {{specifically}} poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) or poly(GMA-co-EDMA) <b>monoliths,</b> are a {{new generation}} of chromatographic supports and are significantly different from conventional particle-based adsorbents, membranes, and other monolithic supports for biomolecule purification. Similar to other <b>monoliths,</b> polymethacrylate <b>monoliths</b> possess large pores which allow convective flow of mobile phase and result in high flow rates at reduced pressure drop, unlike particulate supports. The simplicity of the adsorbent synthesis, pH resistance, and the ease and flexibility of tailoring their pore size to that of the target biomolecule are the key properties which differentiate polymethacrylate <b>monoliths</b> from other <b>monoliths.</b> Polymethacrylate <b>monoliths</b> are endowed with reactive epoxy groups for easy functionalization (with anion-exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity ligands) and high ligand retention. In this review, the structure and performance of polymethacrylate <b>monoliths</b> for chromatographic purification of biomolecules are evaluated and compared to those of other supports. The development and use of polymethacrylate <b>monoliths</b> for research applications have grown rapidly in recent times and have enabled the achievement of high through-put biomolecule purification on semi-preparative and preparative scales...|$|R

5|$|<b>Monolith</b> Soft's first {{project was}} Xenosaga Episode I, a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) for the PlayStation 2. Xenosaga was a spiritual successor to Xenogears; development began in 2000 when enough staff had been gathered, lasting approximately two years. As with Xenogears, {{the game was}} scripted by Takahashi and Tanaka, who planned out the Xenosaga series as a hexalogy. In 2001, Namco producer Shinji Noguchi and <b>Monolith</b> Soft's Tadashi Nomura conceived a new IP for the GameCube unconnected to Xenosaga.

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to <b>Monolith</b> Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within <b>Monolith</b> Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. <b>Monolith</b> Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), <b>Monolith</b> Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{next game}} {{released}} from <b>Monolith</b> Soft, again {{in collaboration with}} Banpresto, was Project X Zone for the Nintendo 3DS. A successor to Namco × Capcom, the game received development support from and featured characters from franchises owned by Namco Bandai, Capcom and introduced Sega franchises. Following the release of Xenoblade Chronicles, <b>Monolith</b> Soft was also working on a followup titled Xenoblade Chronicles X for the Wii U. A spiritual successor to the first game, and the company's first high-definition video game title. Xenoblade Chronicles X shifted from a story-driven to an open world gameplay-driven structure. The incorporation of an extensive multiplayer element resulted in its release being delayed and the narrative being substantially altered. <b>Monolith</b> Soft also developed a sequel to Project X Zone, Project X Zone 2. In addition to changing the character roster selected from Sega, Capcom and Bandai Namco, the game introduced characters from the Nintendo franchise Fire Emblem in addition to characters from Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{the debut}} game title of Japanese {{developer}} <b>Monolith</b> Soft. Company founder Tetsuya Takahashi acted as director and co-writer. Takahashi had previously worked at Square on the PlayStation RPG Xenogears. Initially planned as a six-part series and despite there being concept {{work for a}} sequel, Xenogears was left as a standalone project while Square decided to focus on their established franchises such as Final Fantasy. Another stated reason was that Square {{said they did not}} have the money available to invest in his concept. Following his departure from Square due to disagreeing with their strategy, Takahashi searched for another company which could help him create the game he and others from the Xenogears project envisioned. According to producer Hirohide Sugiura, most of the companies they contacted suggested forming <b>Monolith</b> Soft as an independent developer, with only Namco suggesting that they become a subsidiary, and was willing to both fund the production and manage the logistics and marketing, allowing <b>Monolith</b> Soft staff to focus solely on creating the game. Following this agreement, Namco helped in the development and marketing of the game. While production of the game began following the foundation of <b>Monolith</b> Soft in 2000, Takahashi had been working on the game's concept since 1999, intending it as a spiritual successor to Xenogears rather than a remake or sequel. Production at <b>Monolith</b> Soft took two years. The development budget apparently reached ¥1 billion—approximately $7,700,000 USD.|$|E

40|$|Various organic-based <b>monoliths</b> were {{prepared}} and optimized for immobilization of the protein human serum albumin (HSA) as a binding agent for chiral separations and high-performance affinity chromatography. These <b>monoliths</b> contained co-polymers based on glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} (EDMA) or GMA and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM). A mixture of cyclohexanol and 1 -dodecanol {{was used as the}} porogen, with the ratio of these solvents being varied along with the polymerization temperature to generate a library of <b>monoliths.</b> These <b>monoliths</b> were used with both the Schiff base and epoxy immobilization methods and measured for their final content of HSA. <b>Monoliths</b> showing the highest protein content were further evaluated in chromatographic studies using R/S-warfarin and D/L-tryptophan as model chiral solutes. A 2. 6 – 2. 7 -fold increase in HSA content was obtained in the final <b>monoliths</b> when compared to similar HSA <b>monoliths</b> prepared according to the literature. The increased protein content made it possible for the new <b>monoliths</b> to provide higher retention and/or two-fold faster separations for the tested solutes when using 4. 6 mm i. d. × 50 mm columns. These <b>monoliths</b> were also used to create 4. 6 mm i. d. × 10 mm HSA microcolumns that could separate the same chiral solutes in only 1. 5 – 6. 0 min.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the first Xenosaga game, Takahashi and Sugiura reassessed the {{internal}} structure of <b>Monolith</b> Soft, determining that the current lead developers were too old, clashing with their intended goals for the company to foster young talent. With this mindset, Takahashi stepped down from his lead role in the Xenosaga series, he continued to work for the company in a supervisory role by providing scenario draft's, while younger staff continued the series development. This move also allowed Takahashi a greater degree of creative freedom in a number of projects as opposed to being tied to a single series. In May 2002, <b>Monolith</b> Soft moved from Yokohama to their current offices in Meguro, Tokyo. The next entry in the Xenosaga series, Xenosaga Episode II, began development under a new team following {{the release of}} Episode I. While developing Episode II, the staff shifted their focus from the main series to help tell the story through multiple media. Among these additional projects was , a spin-off title for mobile devices co-developed with Tom Create and Namco Mobile. Pied Piper was Tanaka's last work on the Xenosaga series. Beginning in 2003, <b>Monolith</b> Soft also developed Namco × Capcom, a PlayStation 2 crossover game featuring character's from various Namco and Capcom video games. The idea was proposed by <b>Monolith</b> Soft, with development lasting two years.|$|E
5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which <b>Monolith</b> Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, <b>Monolith</b> Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing <b>Monolith</b> Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and {{was beginning to}} feel frustrated {{due to a lack of}} creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that <b>Monolith</b> Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into <b>Monolith</b> Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff could focus on game development. An important supporter of <b>Monolith</b> Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals and ideals. <b>Monolith</b> Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s.
