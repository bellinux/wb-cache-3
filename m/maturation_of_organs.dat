40|$|Fetal {{development}} {{is dependent on}} maternal supply of fuels and building blocks. Disturbed maternal metabolism or inappropriate maternal nutrition confronts the fetus with an unfavourable intra-uterine milieu. Structural and functional adaptations occur during development and <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs.</b> Consequences of these fetal alterations persist postnatally and may result in metabolic alterations throughout life. Gestational diabetes can occur in these offspring and transmit the effect to the next generation. These alterations in fetal development {{can be associated with}} fetal macrosomia (maternal diabetes) or fetal growth-restriction (maternal/fetal malnutrition). The relation between birth weight and later metabolic disease therefore is U-shaped. Adult metabolic condition is thus to a considerable extent programmed in utero, fetal and neonatal weight being symptoms of disturbed fetal development. This concept of intra-uterine programming of disease is illustrated with a review of epidemiological human studies and experimental animal studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryLittle {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} governing neonatal growth and <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs.</b> Here we demonstrate that calcineurin/Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (Cn/NFAT) signaling regulates neonatal pancreatic development in mouse and human islets. Inactivation of calcineurin b 1 (Cnb 1) in mouse islets impaired dense core granule biogenesis, decreased insulin secretion, and reduced cell proliferation and mass, culminating in lethal diabetes. Pancreatic β cells lacking Cnb 1 failed to express genes revealed to be direct NFAT targets required for replication, insulin storage, and secretion. In contrast, glucokinase activation stimulated Cn-dependent expression of these genes. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, used for human immunosuppression, induce diabetes. Tacrolimus exposure reduced Cn/NFAT-dependent expression of factors essential for insulin dense core granule formation and secretion and neonatal β cell proliferation, consistent with our genetic studies. Discovery of conserved pathways regulating β cell maturation and proliferation suggests new strategies for controlling β cell growth or replacement in human islet diseases...|$|E

40|$|The {{postnatal}} development and maturation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of neonatal calves {{is crucial for}} their survival. Major morphological and functional changes in the calf's GI tract initiated by colostrum bioactive substances promote the establishment of intestinal digestion and absorption of food. It is generally accepted that colostrum intake provokes the <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> and systems in young calves, illustrating {{the significance of the}} cow-to-calf connection at birth. These postnatal adaptive changes of the GI tissues in neonatal calves are especially induced by the action of bioactive substances such as insulin-like growth factors, hormones, or cholesterol carriers abundantly present in colostrum. These substances interact with specific cell-surface receptors or receptor-like transporters expressed in the GI wall of neonatal calves to elicit their biological effects. Therefore, the abundance and activity of cell surface receptors and receptor-like transporters binding colostral bioactive substances are a key aspect determining the effects of the cow-to-calf connection at birth. The present review compiles the information describing the effects of colostrum feeding on selected serum metabolic and endocrine traits in neonatal calves. In this context, the current paper discusses specifically the consequences of colostrum feeding on the GI expression and activity of cell-receptors and receptor-like transporters binding growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors, insulin, or cholesterol acceptors in neonatal calves...|$|E
40|$|A {{multilevel}} {{housing system}} for broilers was developed, named Patio (Vencomatic BV, Eersel, the Netherlands), {{in which the}} hatching and brooding phase are combined. In a Patio system, climate conditions differ from those provided in the hatchers currently in use. We compared the physiology of broilers hatched in a hatcher or in a Patio system, and included the effects of hatching time. Eggs from 1 breeder flock were incubated until embryonic d 18 in a setter and subsequently placed in a hatcher or the Patio {{until the end of}} incubation. From each hatching system, 154 chicks were collected per hatching time, at 465 h (early), 480 h (midterm), and 493 h (late) of incubation, from which 24 chicks/group were decapitated for analyses of blood plasma and organ weights. The remaining 130 chicks in each group from both systems were individually labeled and placed together in the Patio system. All chicks were given access to feed and water directly after hatch and were housed up to d 45 to monitor growth. From embryonic d 18 until the end of incubation, average ambient temperature and RH were 38. 1 °C and 50. 8 % in the hatcher and 35. 2 °C and 29. 7 % in the Patio system. Glucose and corticosterone were slightly higher in hatcher chicks, whereas organ weights were not affected by the hatching system. Although hatchling weights were lower in hatchery chicks, growth from d 0 to 45 was not affected by the hatching system. In both systems, glucose increased with hatching time, whereas lactate and triiodothyronine levels decreased. Yolk weights decreased with hatching time, whereas absolute and relative weights of the yolk-free body, intestines, stomach, lungs, and heart increased, indicating more advanced <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs.</b> Growth up to d 21 was depressed in chicks in the late group, which was possibly related to lower thyroid hormone levels at hatching. We conclude that the hatching system had minor effects on hatchling physiology and that posthatch growth and livability were not affected. Because hatching time affected broiler physiology, it seems important to take hatching time into account in future studies related to hatchling physiology...|$|E
40|$|Organ {{failure is}} one the biggest problems, doctors face every day. Many {{patients}} {{are not able}} to get a transplant, but even those who recieved it, may undergo painful process of organ rejection and be on the transplant waiting list again. Organ transplants shortage is severe problem in current medicine that has many ethical and medical issues. To solve this problem, the new direction in regenerative medicine was formed, organ prinitng. The main goal of organ printing is fabrication of organ replacements that would mimic the original ones in terms of complexity and functionality. By direct fabrication and <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> in vitro, the problem of organ shortage can be solved, moreover, based on the advances in cell therapy, these organs can be printed with patients own cells, which will eliminte the problem of transplant rejection. Organ printing is multistep and complex process, composed of three main steps: tissue design, or theoretical modelling of replacement composition; tissue fabrication, or direct cell encapsulation and controlled assembly of building units; at last, tissue maturation to reach desirable functionality of the replacement. In the past decade, there was developed a variety of methods for the second step of organ printing, cell encapsulation, which is practicaly the main procedure for tissue fabrication. However, all these methods of cell encapsulation are complex and they might affect cells viability and functionality, which will result in changed tissue function. Thus, starting from the detailed analysis of the tissue fabrication process (encapsulation and assembly methods) the list of possible cell behavior affectors was composed. Based on this list, we designed a multistep protocol for coherent evaluation of cells behavior parameters, in terms of viability, functionality and activity during the tissue fabrication and its maturation steps. Three main materials were used for this study, two naturally (alginate and modified gelatin) and one synthetically (polyethilene glycol) derived polymers. 3 The encapsulation step was performed with two different methods based on chemical or photo crosslinking of the material. Cell parameteres were evaluated on the molecular level for variety of parameters, including viability, activity, proliferation, stress markers expression, at last ability to adapt artificial environment to the cell functional niche with extracellular matrix markers expression, and proteoglycans. The innovation of the presented study consists in the developing a unique protocol for detailed cell functionality evaluation during the organ printing procedures. In fact, based on the conducted study, it was proved the safety of the encapsulation methods. Moreover, based on the cell parameters post-encapsulation, there was suggested the optimal time for tissue maturation for application of the fabricated structures in organ printing, but also in other fileds, like developmental and pathological biology, or drug screening. Eventully, a novel way of simple blocks assembly into 3 D complex structures was developed and proved to be safe for cell parameters. At last, for the future research in organ printing, a detailed study over a cell behavior and functionality has to be performed for every fabrication method, what will improve the organ production process drastically...|$|E

40|$|Neonatal mouse {{cochlear}} supporting {{cells have}} a limited ability to divide and trans-differentiate into hair cells, but this ability declines rapidly in the two weeks after birth. This decline is concomitant with the morphological and functional <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> <b>of</b> Corti prior to the onset of hearing. However, despite this association between <b>maturation</b> and loss <b>of</b> regenerative potential, little is known of the molecular changes that underlie these events. To identify these changes, we used RNA-seq to generate transcriptional profiles of purified cochlear supporting cells from 1 - and 6 -day-old mice.

40|$|The prepartum {{surge in}} fetal plasma cortisol, {{essential}} for the <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> in mammals and the normal timing of parturition in some species, including sheep, may result from {{an increase in the}} molar ratio of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the fetal circulation. Related to this, the cleavage of POMC to ACTH by the enzyme, prohormone convertase 1 (PC 1), may be influenced by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the capacity of individual corticotrophs to process POMC to ACTH may vary and individual corticotrophs are differentially responsive to CRH. It is not known, however, if there are separate corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary which can be identified by differential colocalisation of POMC, ACTH and the CRH receptor 1, CRHR₁, nor if changes in the relative proportions of such subpopulations {{play a role in the}} molecular mechanisms underlying the overall changes in pituitary function described previously during gestation and in response to suboptimal uterine environments. To investigate these hypotheses, it was first necessary to develop novel methods for the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of POMC, ACTH and CRHR₁ in individual cells on sections of fetal sheep pituitary. In addition, I developed and validated an automated method to categorise and count individual cells to increase the quantitative power of this study. Pituitary tissue was collected from control fetuses at 53 - 55 (n= 6), 63 - 85 (n= 6), 110 (n= 4), 139 - 141 (n= 4) and 144 - 145 (n= 6) days gestation. Two animal models, known to alter pituitary function in the fetal sheep, were used to investigate corticotrophic adaptations to suboptimal uterine environments. For the maternal periconceptional undernutrition (PCUN) model, maternal feed was reduced to 70 % of maintenance requirements from at least 45 days before to 7 days after mating and fetal tissues were collected at 53 - 55 days gestation (n= 7). For the placental restriction (PR) model, the majority of the placental attachment sites were removed in five ewes before mating and fetal tissues were collected at 140 (n= 4) and 144 (n= 4) days gestation. Pituitary sections were simultaneously labelled with antisera raised against full length POMC, ACTH and CRHR₁ and the proportions of pituitary cells with combinations of antisera were quantified. Four subpopulations of corticotrophs were identified, which expressed either: POMC+ACTH+CRHR₁, ACTH+CRHR₁, POMC+ CRHR₁ or POMConly. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR₁ between 53 - 55 and 65 - 85 days gestation, before an increase at 110 days gestation and a further marked decrease between 139 - 141 and 144 - 145 days gestation. In fetuses from the PCUN group, the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR₁ in early gestation was reduced. PR resulted in a significantly higher proportion of corticotrophs expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR₁ during the prepartum period. This work represents the discovery of the differential expression of POMC, ACTH and CRHR₁ in individual corticotrophs of the fetal sheep pituitary and the first insights into the pituitary adaptations to periconceptional nutrient restriction and placental restriction at the level of individual corticotrophs.

Following a request by the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a Scientific Opinion (May 2014) on the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for iodine, which are provided as Adequate Intake (AI), based on a large epidemiological study in European schoolchildren which used urinary iodine concentrations as a measure of adequate intake. On the grounds of this data an AI of 150 mcg was postulated for adults while an AI of between 70 mcg and 130 mcg was thought to be required for infants (7 - 11 months) and children. An AI of 200 mcg was proposed for pregnant and lactating women. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The microRNA (miR) 183 cluster, {{which is}} {{comprised}} of miRs- 183,- 96 and- 182, is also a miR family with se-quence homology. Despite the strong similarity in the sequences of these miRs, minute differences in their seed sequences result in both overlapping and dis-tinct messenger RNA targets, which are often within the same pathway. These miRs have tightly synchro-nized expression during development and are re-quired for <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> sensory <b>organs.</b> In compar-ison to their defined role in normal development, the miR- 183 family is frequently highly expressed {{in a variety of}} non-sensory diseases, including cancer, neurological and auto-immune disorders. Here, we discuss the conservation of the miR- 183 cluster and the functional role of this miR family in normal de-velopment and diseases. We also describe the reg-ulation of vital cellular pathways by coordinated ex-pression of these miR siblings. This comprehensive review sheds light on the likely reasons why the ge-nomic organization and seeming redundancy of the miR- 183 family cluster was conserved through 600 million years of evolution...|$|R
40|$|Glucocorticoids {{are vital}} for the {{structural}} and functional <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> foetal <b>organs,</b> yet excessive foetal exposure is detrimental to adult cardiovascular health. To elucidate {{the role of}} glucocorticoid signalling in late-gestation cardiovascular maturation, we have generated mice with conditional disruption of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells using smooth muscle protein 22 -driven Cre recombinase (SMGRKO mice) and compared them with mice with global deficiency in GR (GR(-/-)). Echocardiography shows impaired heart function in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at embryonic day (E) 17. 5, associated with generalized oedema. Cardiac ultrastructure is markedly disrupted in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at E 17. 5, with short, disorganized myofibrils and cardiomyocytes that fail to align in the compact myocardium. Failure to induce critical genes involved in contractile function, calcium handling and energy metabolism underpins this common phenotype. However, although hearts of GR(-/-) mice are smaller, with 22 % reduced ventricular volume at E 17. 5, SMGRKO hearts are normally sized. Moreover, while levels of mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic peptide are reduced in E 17. 5 GR(-/-) hearts, they are normal in foetal SMGRKO hearts. These data demonstrate that structural, functional and biochemical <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> the foetal heart is dependent on glucocorticoid signalling within cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle, though some aspects <b>of</b> heart <b>maturation</b> (size, ANP expression) are independent of GR at these key sites...|$|R
40|$|During fetal life, it is {{critical}} that there is coordinate regulation of the growth, zonation and differentiation of the fetal adrenal cortex to ensure that cells in key tissues and organs are exposed in a programmed temporal sequence to the actions of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are essential for <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> key target <b>organs</b> before birth, including the lung, brain, liver, gut, kidney and adrenal, and the prepartum increase in glucocorticoid synthesis and secretion by the fetal adrenal gland {{is critical}} for the successful transition to postnatal life. It is also evident that premature or abnormal exposure of embryonic or fetal tissues to glucocorticoids during critical windows of development can irreversibly alter the programmed development <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> systems. Premature or abnormal exposure of the fetus to excess glucocorticoids may occur either as a consequence of endogenous stimulation of the fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) or as a consequence of exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids in a therapeutic context. Administration of synthetic glucocorticoids to women at risk of preterm labour, for example, is a routine clinical practice designed to improve respiratory function and neonatal outcome. It is clearly important to understand what endogenous factors regulate the growth and functional <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal cortex during development and the consequent likelihood of exposure of developing tissues to excess corticosteroids. To date, investigations have centred on the role of ACTH 1 - 39 in the stimulation of adrenal growth and steroidogenesis in long gestation species, such as the primate and sheep, where <b>maturation</b> and differentiation <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> systems occurs predominantly before birth. In this review, we will focus on the evidence that in addition to ACTH 1 - 39, other pro-opio-melanocortin (POMC) derived peptides, which are synthesized, processed and secreted by the fetal pituitary, {{play a role in the}} coordinate regulation of the specific phases of growth and functional development of the fetal adrenal gland in vivo. We will discuss our recent findings on the direct in vivo actions of N-POMC 1 - 77 and separately, insulin like growth factor II (IGF-II), as adrenal growth factors. These studies provide an understanding of the separate regulatory mechanisms which control activation of adrenal growth and stimulation of adrenal steroidogenesis in the late gestation fetus. C. L.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{characterize}} microRNA (miRNA) expression {{profile in}} microdissected auditory epithelia from the Corti’s Organ in new born and adult rats. MethodsThe TaqMan® MicroRNA Arrays {{were used to}} identify expression of microRNA in the new born and adult groups. GO analysis was applied to analyze the main function of the differential expression genes according to the Gene Ontology which is the key functional classification of NCBI. Similarly, Pathway {{analysis was used to}} find out the significant pathway of the differential genes according to KEGG, Biocarta and Reatome. ResultsIncreased expression was seen in 16 miRNAs in mature rat compared to new born rats, with increased folding ranging from 17 to 600 folds. Expression levels in 2 miRNAs were reduced in mature rats, namely rno–miR– 29 c and rno–miR– 29 a. The high–enrichment GOs targeted by over–expressed miRNAs were negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, common–partner SMAD protein phosphorylation, mesenchymal–epithelial cell signaling, regulation of transforming growth factor beta 2 production, etc. Functional analysis of miRNAs by KEGG revealed that 19 signal transduction pathways were upregulated and 14 were downregulated. ConclusionsThe difference in miRNA expression patterns in the <b>organ</b> <b>of</b> Corti between neonatal and adult rats may be closely related to <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> <b>of</b> Corti and loss of proliferative capacity of inner ear hair cells, and TGFß signaling may {{play an important role in}} hair cells regeneration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{functions}} of juvenile hormone in the physiological and behavioral maturation in Apis mellifera males (drones) were investigated by {{application of a}} juvenile hormone analog, methoprene. No evidence was found for the stimulation <b>of</b> <b>maturation</b> <b>of</b> male reproductive <b>organs</b> by methoprene. The dry weight of the seminal vesicle and reproductive accessory gland was slightly but significantly lighter in drones treated with a high dose (100 or 500  μg/male) of methoprene than drones treated either with a low dose (1 or 10  μg/male) or solvent control only. Methoprene accelerated in-colony male movement from the center to the periphery. It also induced earlier diet transition from pollen and jelly-like materials to honey. These results suggest that juvenile hormone acts as a behavioral pacemaker {{rather than as a}} gonadotropin in drones...|$|R
