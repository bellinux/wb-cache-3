2500|$|In 1975, {{concerned}} that Montana was a [...] "stereotypical colonial state" [...] with little economic development whose natural resources would be extracted {{and the state}} left with severe environmental degradation, the Montana State Legislature enacted a severance tax on each ton of coal mined in the state. Then-Governor Tom Judge called the statute [...] "the most significant piece of legislation enacted in Montana in this century." [...] It was attacked in a RAND Corporation study (partly financed by the National Academies of Science) as excessive. An amendment was proposed and adopted in 1976 requiring that at least one-fourth of the coal severance tax be deposited into a Permanent Coal Tax Trust Fund and that, after 1979, {{at least half the}} tax revenues be deposited into the fund. The fund could not be tapped unless three-fourths of each chamber of the state legislature voted to do so. The tax, levied on the cost [...] "at the mine mouth," [...] varied depending on the market value of the coal, the coal's energy content, and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction.</b> Generally speaking, most sub-bituminous coal was taxed at a rate of 30% and lignite coal at 20%.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{mannitol}} {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction — [...] CO2 versus [...] ethanol per [...] olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only [...] water per [...] of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique.|$|E

The monitoring of its concentration in the organism is recommended, particularly in the case when a patient suffers of others illnesses and is treated with different drugs, which can interfere with VEN.

The present study is the review of actual reports on the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> VEN and its metabolite from blood and other human diagnostic materials, like saliva and urine, and also from animals tissues. The paper shows the classic extraction methods, such as liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction.

According to the literature it can be stated that the best recovery of VEN and its main metabolite, O-demethylvenlafaxine, was obtained when the liquid-liquid extraction was used. The new, modified <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction,</b> are cost-effective, owing to the reduced use of solvents and also smaller volume of diagnostic material, but the results of the analysis, especially the recovery of the analytes, were lower than those obtained by classic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction...</b>|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine which extraction method will give higher natural antioxidant contents and antioxidant activity. The content of natural antioxidant and antioxidant activity were analysed by total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity assay. The results showed that extracts from a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method without the addition of modifier showed the highest content of total phenolic (187. 66 mg GAE / g) and flavonoid (1100. 93 mg QE/g) in P. niruri compared to the other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> with different type of solvents. The extract of P. niruri from different extraction methods showed antioxidant activity on DPPH radical scavenging assay.
