Its line-up of programmes feature long-running shows, such as the science news programme Delta, whilst other programmes like A Hét (The Week), a weekly review programme and Ablak (Window), an afternoon-long <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme</b> featuring general interest programmes, were both axed in recent years.|$|R
40|$|Aware of the {{increasing}} impact of human activities on the Earth system, Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo) launched in 1997 a research programme {{in support of a}} sustainable development policy. This <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme</b> included the Belgian Scientific Programme on Antarctic Research. The International Polar Foundation, an organization led by the civil engineer and explorer Alain Hubert, was commissioned by the Belgian Federal government in 2004 to design, construct and operate a new Belgian Antarctic Research Station as an element under this <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme.</b> The station was to be designed as a central location for investigating the characteristic sequence of Antarctic geographical regions (polynia, coast, ice shelf, ice sheet, marginal mountain area and dry valleys, inland plateau) within a radius of 200 kilometers (approx. 124 miles) of a selected site. The station was also to be designed as "state of the art" with respect to sustainable development, energy consumption, and waste disposal, with a minimum lifetime of 25 years. The goal of the project was to build a station and enable science. So first we needed some basic requirements, which I have listed here; plus we had to finance the station ourselves. Our most important requirement was that we decided to make it a zero emissions station. This was both a philosophical choice as we thought it more consistent with Antarctic Treaty obligations and it was also a logistical advantage.

40|$|Learning-driven, {{adaptive}} {{approaches to}} designing research and implementing programmes are increasingly popular in {{fields such as}} international development. Among funding agencies {{there is also a}} growing trend towards “multi-project programmes”, the grouping together of many projects under a single <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme,</b> the aim being to enhance how projects, organisations and individuals exchange knowledge and learn from one another. Tiina Pasanen and Blane Harvey here outline eight emerging lessons on fostering learning in large research and development programmes; from a warning never to make assumptions about a collaborative mindset, through the importance of investing in facilitated face-to-face engagement, to the need to regularly review and adapt learning mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Brazil is {{the largest}} country in South America, and {{is known to have}} a low to {{moderate}} poverty rate. Poverty in Brazil is more focused in the north-eastern region of the country: 60% of poor people live there, and the majority of them are of Afro-Brazilian heritage. Over 8.9 million Brazilians live on less than $2 a day. After the macroeconomic stabilization {{in the second half of}} the 1990s, different Brazilian administrations have increasingly addressed the issue of poverty. The Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) and Brasil Sem Miséria (Brazil without Poverty) programmes have lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. The former served as an <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme</b> for multiple conditional cash transfer initiative Bolsa Familia. All three programmes were established under the Workers Party governments. The latter was instrumental in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) of reducing extreme poverty in Brazil, with Brazil surpassing the target The poverty headcount in 2012 stood at 9%, down from 21% in 2005 and 34% in 1996. The rate of extreme poverty was 3.6% in 2012 compared to 13.4% in 1990. In 2014 Brazil managed to exit FAO's world map of malnutrition. http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/brazil ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{and need for}} sub-national fiscal reforms is all too obvious in India where the States are facing severe fiscal imbalances {{since the beginning of}} the nineties. A decade of political strife in the eighties, followed by populist economic policies in the nineties led to a massive fiscal deterioration in Punjab, hampering its overall growth process. The Fiscal Reform Programme in the state was initiated in 1999 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of India and the Punjab government. This was followed by the setting up of various committees and commissions to look into the problems of revenue mobilisation, expenditure management, public enterprises and the power sector. The more recent effort towards fiscal consolidation has been the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. The assessment of the entire fiscal reform effort of the state reveals that the Punjab government is seized of the seriousness of the situation, admits the gravity of consequences but lacks the grit and determination to implement certain hard decisions for fiscal restructuring. The government is very much caught up in the web # This paper was prepared under the <b>umbrella</b> <b>Programme</b> of Capacity Building for Budgetary Analyses at the State Level administered b...|$|R
40|$|So-called ‘neglected {{tropical}} diseases’ (NTDs) {{are becoming}} less neglected, with increasing {{political and financial}} commitments to their control. These recent developments were preceded by substantial advocacy for integrated control of different NTDs, {{on the premise that}} integration is both feasible and cost-effective. Although the approach is intuitively attractive, there are few countrywide experiences to confirm or refute this assertion. Using the example of Uganda, this article reviews the geographical and epidemiological bases for integration and assesses the potential opportunities for, and operational challenges of, integrating existing control activities for several of these diseases under an <b>umbrella</b> vertical <b>programme...</b>|$|R

40|$|PhDThis {{thesis is}} based on a {{practice}} based research project with women in prison led by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw and myself. The project, Staging Human Rights II, took place in two prisons in England, HMP Highpoint and HMP and YOI Bullwood Hall, and two prisons in Brazil, Presidio Nelson Hungria and Penetenciaria Talavera Bruce. The research was conducted between September 2001 and June 2003. The project was part of a larger, <b>umbrella</b> <b>programme,</b> Staging Human Rights, which sought to find ways, through performance methodologies, in which the language of human rights could incorporate the everyday lives and experiences of people within the criminal justice system. Within this context, Weaver and Shaw called upon non-cognitive, postmodern performance strategies through which the women in prison witnessed their own lives through the testimony of performance. Theoretical considerations of witness and testimony frame the thesis, situating performance as an act of witness, and positioning testimony as an urgent and critical epistemological act in the field of Applied Performance. My research was guided by two questions: what can be known of the possibilities of performance by working with women in prison? What can be known of the context of women's prisons through performance? The thesis is structured into two sections. Section I, made up of Chapters 1 - 5, considers the theoretical and practical contexts in which the practice based research was undertaken. Section II, Chapter 6, considers each of the five performance residencies and In The House, the performance event in which the research culminated on 23 June 2003. This section calls upon performative writing to both describe and reflect upon the practice and its context. Through writing this thesis, I am bearing witness to what I have come to understand of the possibilities of performance and the experiences of women in prison through performance practice with women in prison...|$|R

40|$|This book is {{the first}} of several with the results of a {{collaborative}} European project supported by the European Science Foundation on changes in the academic profession in Europe (EUROAC). It provides a short description of the ESF EUROHESC programme and the particular forms of international collaborative research projects which are funded under the <b>umbrella</b> of this <b>programme.</b> It then outlines the EUROAC project. This project has chosen three foci (governance, professionalisation, academic careers) to analyse changes {{in the work of the}} academic profession. The first results in the form of in-depth literature reviews constitute the content of the book. These eight literature reviews about the state of the art of existing research feature the various dimensions of the overall theme. A particular emphasis is put on factors leading to changes in the work tasks of the academic profession in Europe and how the academic profession is coping with these new challenges. Thus, the book provides a state of the art account of existing research about the following themes: main results of previous studies on the academic profession; the academic profession and their interaction with new higher education professionals; professional identities in higher education; extending work tasks: civic mission and sustainable development; academic careers in academic markets; the changing role of academics in the face of rising managerialism; the influence of quality assurance, governance, and relevance on the satisfaction of the academic profession...|$|R
