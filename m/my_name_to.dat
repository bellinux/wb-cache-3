500|$|Nuffield {{was dismayed}} by the model of Harrison's plans, as the {{buildings}} {{were not in the}} general Oxford collegiate style that he was known to favour. After a meeting with the University's Vice-Chancellor, A. D. Lindsay, Nuffield wrote to him on 15August 1939 to say that he felt [...] "obliged to adhere to my adverse judgement of the plans". The design was [...] "un-English and out of keeping with the best tradition of Oxford architecture", said Nuffield, adding that [...] "if a building of this type were to be erected, I would not allow <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> be associated therewith".|$|E

[...] The SS-VT was renamed the Waffen-SS in a speech made by Hitler in July 1940. Hitler then authorized the enlistment of [...] "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes, and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. They were brought together to form the new division SS-Wiking. In January 1941, the SS-Verfügungs Division was renamed SS-Reich Division (Motorized), and was renamed as the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich when it was reorganized as a Panzergrenadier division in 1942.|$|E

2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration.

We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation. I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who insisted that I call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E

The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success making The New York Times Best Seller list. It was criticized by porno movie industry insiders. In the book, Lords revealed that she received only $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in Penthouse. Lords continued to use the now famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor, and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, [...] "I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I won it, legally changing <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be."

2500|$|Flynn {{wrote his}} first song in 1960. This song was {{recorded}} {{by a group}} called [...] "The Citations." [...] Flynn received his first songwriting contract from Jimmie Davis, former governor of Louisiana {{and a member of}} both the [...] "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum" [...] and the [...] "Country Music Songwriters Hall of Fame." [...] Davis never did record Flynn's song, but his encouragement motivated Flynn to keep writing. Gene Hooper cut one of Flynn's songs in 1974. The song was called [...] "Caroline Stood by Me," [...] and it became a [...] "pick hit of the week" [...] on Maine's biggest country music station, WPOR. Since that time Flynn's songwriting has expanded, and Flynn's efforts have been rewarded with many cuts of his songs by various artists around world, mainly the country genre.

2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>to,</b> well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by some other people who actually put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E
