The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme.

25|$|One of Petrosian's {{most famous}} {{examples}} of the positional exchange sacrifice is from his game against Samuel Reshevsky in Zurich 1953. Reshevsky, playing white, appears to have an advantage due to his strong pawn center, which may become mobile after Bf3 and d4–d5. Petrosian realized {{he was in a}} difficult position because of the passive placement of his pieces, relegated to defensive roles. He further understood that White might also advance on the kingside with h2–h4–h5, provoking weaknesses that would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> defend later on. Faced with these threats, Petrosian devised a plan to maneuver his knight to the square d5, where it would be prominently placed in the center, and blockade the advance of White's pawns.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{legislative}} activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of Oxycontin’s composition to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> crush for snorting or injecting.

Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} actions along the {{recycling}} supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It {{begins with the}} waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can {{affect the quality of}} final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.|$|E

500|$|The {{psychologist}} Seymour Fisher considered Sexual Preference a {{high quality}} study. He argued that despite their skeptical attitude toward Freudian theory, Bell et al.′s findings support some of Sigmund Freud′s predictions about how homosexual men view their parents, writing that despite Bell et al.′s claim {{that there is no}} strong connection, the [...] "negative father" [...] factor had a detectable impact on [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experience" [...] for men. Fisher maintained that like other investigators, Bell et al. provided no information {{that could be used to}} evaluate Freud's vague statements concerning how homosexual women would perceive their mothers, but that their data does support Freud′s expectation that homosexual women would perceive their fathers in [...] "negative, frustrating terms", and that among the studies he evaluated theirs was one of the most supportive. He viewed Bell et al.′s findings about lesbianism as especially significant since their study was published in 1981 and had one of the largest diverse samples. Fisher wrote that a significant effect was apparent despite Bell et al. deliberately minimizing the overall importance of the father factor in the development of female homosexuality. Fisher argued that Bell et al.′s finding that recalled patterns of relationships with mother and father predicted homosexual preferences during adolescence, but not the likelihood of being primarily homosexual as an adult, could be explained by the fact that only some of those willing to engage in [...] "homosexual intimacy" [...] during their earlier years can find satisfactory opportunities to do so as they leave adolescence, which might <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find correlations between early parent-child relationships and [...] "later overt homosexuality." ...|$|E
