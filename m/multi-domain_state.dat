40|$|We have {{employed}} spin-polarized {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the effect of lateral confinement onto the nanoskyrmion lattice in Fe/Ir(111). We find a strong coupling of one diagonal of the square magnetic unit cell to the close-packed edges of Fe nanostructures. In triangular islands this coupling {{in combination with the}} mismatching symmetries of the islands and of the square nanoskyrmion lattice leads to frustration and triple-domain states. In direct vicinity to ferromagnetic NiFe islands, the surrounding skyrmion lattice forms additional domains. In this case a side of the square magnetic unit cell prefers a parallel orientation to the ferromagnetic edge. These experimental findings can be reproduced and explained by Monte-Carlo simulations. Here, the single-domain state of a triangular island is lower in energy, but nevertheless <b>multi-domain</b> <b>states</b> occur due to the combined effect of entropy and an intrinsic domain wall pinning arising from the skyrmionic character of the spin texture.

40|$|When a fluid that {{undergoes}} a vapor to liquid transition in the bulk {{is confined to}} a long cylindrical pore, the phase transition is shifted (mostly due to surface effects at {{the walls of the}} pore) and rounded (due to finite size effects). The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on the length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous at low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place fluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as a whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality) the system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state,</b> where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate. Using Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the Asakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these two different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density distribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak shape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium domain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded) transition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial correlation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder diameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the transition from the simple domain state to the <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> of the cylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore critical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increase logarithmically with the length of the pore.

Ferromagnetic Ni and Fe nanowires with diameters 30 ~ 250 nm were electroplated into the pores of anodic aluminum oxide membranes. The effects of nanowire diameter on structural and magnetic properties were investigated. The microstructures of these nanowires were studied using X-ray diffraction and selected-area electron diffraction measurements. The magnetic properties of the nanowires were investigated using magnetic hysteresis measurements and magnetic force microscopy. Additionally, ferromagnetic Ni-P nanotubes were fabricated using an electroless chemical deposition method. Structure and composition analyses were conducted using X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the nanotube arrays and the electronic properties of individual nanotubes were studied. Hysteresis measurements revealed that the 250 -nm diameter Ni nanowires had a poor squareness in their hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of <b>multi-domain</b> <b>states.</b> In comparison, the squareness in the hysteresis loops of 60 -nm and 30 -nm Ni nanowires was much improved, suggesting the existence of single domain states in these smaller diameter nanowires. Magnetic force microscopy measurements confirmed the magnetic domain structures suggested by magnetic hysteresis measurements. Similar investigations of Fe nanowires with diameters of 250 nm and 60 nm found that they all have multidomain magnetic structures. This is expected based on their material properties and polycrystalline structures. Furthermore, magnetic structures of Y-branches and multi-wire clusters were also studied using magnetic force microscopy. The as-prepared Ni-P nanotubes had an amorphous structure. Following a heat treatment, however, a structural phase transformation from the amorphous phase to a crystalline phase was observed using X-ray diffraction measurements. The tetragonal crystalline phase of Ni 3 P and the face-centered-cubic phase of Ni were confirmed via simulations by the GSAS software.

40|$|A {{challenge}} in network {{management and control}} {{is the ability to}} account for multi-domain requirements in the network planning process. Especially in Connection Oriented Networks where multi-domain path finding is a critical issue, networks need to be designed in such a manner as to restrict the possibility of erroneous inter-domain path selection. In this paper we propose per-domain topology design considerations that would leverage accurate disjoint path computations in a multi-domain environment, covering requirements of end-to-end path resiliency. In <b>multi-domain</b> environments <b>state</b> information between domains is heavily aggregated, hiding internal topology details dictated by scalability concerns, but also by restrictive domain administration policies for privacy, and security. Disjoint path finding is strongly affected by the aggregation techniques, since they do not provide information on path overlap. To handle this issue we introduce a metric, the Overlap Factor (OF), that quantifies path overlap in domains. The OF can be passed as an additional parameter of the inter-domain information exchange model to evaluate disjoint end-to-end paths. Alternatively, if domains were appropriately designed, this additional parameter might not be needed in evaluating resilient pairs of inter-domain paths. We based our recommended topology design algorithm on exploiting locally known OF values within the context of Genetic Algorithms. Extensive simulations confirm that domains designed using our proposed algorithm, result into accurate multi-domain disjoint path identification, with a high success ratio compared to networks that are designed without inter-domain considerations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|The term ‘pseudo-single domain’ (PSD) {{has been}} used to {{describe}} the transitional state in rock magnetism that spans the particle size range between the single domain (SD) and <b>multi-domain</b> (MD) <b>states.</b> The particle size range for the stable SD state in the most commonly occurring terrestrial magnetic mineral, magnetite, is so narrow (~ 20 - 75 nm) that it is widely considered that much of the paleomagnetic record of interest is carried by ‘PSD’ rather than stable SD particles. The PSD concept has, thus, become the dominant explanation for the magnetization associated with a major fraction of particles that record paleomagnetic signals throughout geological time. In this paper, we argue that in contrast to the SD and MD states, the term ‘PSD’ does not describe the relevant physical processes, which have been documented extensively using three-dimensional micromagnetic modeling, and by parallel research in materials science and solid-state physics. We also argue that features attributed to ‘PSD’ behavior can be explained by nucleation of a single magnetic vortex immediately above the maximum stable SD transition size. With increasing particle size, multiple vortices, antivortices, and domain walls can nucleate, which produce variable cancellation of magnetic moments and a gradual transition into the MD state. Thus, while the term ‘PSD’ describes a well-known transitional state, it fails to describe adequately the physics of the relevant processes. We recommend that use of this term should be discontinued in favor of “vortex state”, which spans a range of behaviors associated with magnetic vortices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{demand for}} new {{materials}} {{to be used}} in field-effect transistors and similar devices with low energy loss is more than ever before as integrated circuits have become a considerable source of energy consumption. One of the challenges in designing such energy efficient logic devices is finding suitable dielectric materials systems for the gate that controls the drain current in a p-type channel. A fundamental limit for energy efficiency exists in such devices imposed by the polarizability of conventional lin-ear gate dielectrics. Generating on/off states in the channel that differ by at least a million times in the magnitude of the drain current near saturation requires several volts of gate bias for the case of a linear dielectric material in a submicron device. In this study, we demonstrate that fer-roelectric–paraelectric superlattice heterostructures can generate the same effect in a p-type channel for bias voltages much lower than in a linear high dielectric con-stant gate. We consider a metal/superlattice/p-type semi-conductor stack for this purpose. Using a thermodynamic model, we show that the <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> of the ferro-electric layers can be tailored and distinct on/off states of the channel are possible for gate bias voltages below 1 V.

40|$|The thermal remagnetization (TR), i. e. the {{reentrance}} of magnetization upon heating in a steady-field demagnetized sample, is {{a common}} feature to the four types of polycrystalline permanent magnets, mainly utilized for practical purposes, i. e. barium ferrites, SmCo 5, Sm 2 Co 17 and NdFeB magnets. The effect is small for pinning controlled and large for nucleation controlled magnets. The effect {{is strongly dependent on}} the demagnetization factor and may reach nearly 100 per cent in SmCo 5 samples measured in a closed circuit. The TR is very sensitive to a small superimposed steady field. The maximum effect and the position of the peak is dependent on the initial temperature. The direction of the TR is correlated with the temperature coefficient of the coercivity, resulting in a inverse TR in barium ferrite. The susceptibility of the thermally remagnetized samples is increased. Repeated cycles of steady-field demagnetization followed by heating result in the same TR. The phenomenology of TR and ITR is explained by means of a model taking into account both the internal field fluctuations due to grain interactions and the decay of single domain grains into <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state.</b> By taking the measured temperature dependencies of the coercivity and the saturation magnetization the theory is able to reproduce the experiments very well, allowing to determine the width of the field fluctuations, the width of the switching field distribution and an internal demagnetization factor as characteristics of the materials by fitting.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{two-dimensional}} micromagnetic modeling of magnetization patterns in Permalloy ellipses {{under the influence}} of rotating constant-amplitude magnetic fields are discussed. Ellipses of two different lateral sizes have been studied, 0. 5 m x 1. 5 m and 1 m x 3 m. The amplitude of the rotating magnetic field was varied between simulations with the condition that it must be large enough to saturate or nearly saturate the ellipse with the field applied along the long axis of the ellipse. For the smaller ellipse size it is found that the magnetization pattern forms an S state and the direction of the net magnetization lags behind the direction of the applied field. At a critical angle of the rotating magnetic field the direction of the magnetization switches by a large angle to a new S state. Both the critical angle and the angle interval of the switch depend on field amplitude. For this new state, it is instead the applied field direction that lags behind the magnetization direction. The transient magnetization patterns correspond to multi-domain patterns including two vortices, but this state never exists for the equilibrated magnetization patterns. The behavior of the larger ellipse in rotating field is different. With the field applied along the long-axis of the ellipse, the magnetization of the ellipse is nearly saturated with a vortex close to each apex of the ellipse. As the field is rotated, this magnetization pattern remains and the net-magnetization direction lags behind the direction of the field until for a certain angle of the applied field an equilibrium <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> is created.

This susceptibility arising from {{the influence of the}} parent rocks tend to mask anthropogenic grains pollutants released into the environment by human activities. Hence, it becomes difficult to identify the effect of the lithological and anthropogenic magnetic susceptibility in complex soil found in urban areas. The superparamagnetic effect of lithological soil, a single state domain and <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> of anthropogenic grains can easily be investigated by frequency dependent measurements where readings between 0 - 2. 0 % indicates the absence of lithological influence, 2. 0 - 8. 0 % indicates multi-domain grains or mixture of both single stage and multi-domian grains and 8. 0 - 12 % indicates the superparamagntic (SP) grain from lithological origin. In this work frequency dependent measurements were carried out along 5 selected road networks within the 5 districts of Abuja phase 1. Measurements were also carried out in 379 random points at the surface and depth of 40. 0 cm to investigate the distribution of anthropogenic grains in Abuja metropolis using the Bartington susceptibility meter. Frequency dependent measurements along the selected road networks indicate 0 - 3. 0 % immediately after the roads pavement to a distance of about 3. 0 m from the road, indicating that the magnetic susceptibility arise mostly form anthropogenic influence rather than lithological processes. At the distance of 3. 0 - 8. 0 m, frequency dependent values of about 3. 0 - 8. 0 % were recorded, indicating mixture of both superparamagnetic and multi-domain grains. Beyond the distance of 8. 0 m, the frequency dependent values are mostly above 8. 0. 0 %, indicating virtually all SP grains. The spatial distribution frequency dependent surface map shows the presence of anthropogenic grains in most part of the areas with frequency dependent values between 0 - 8. 0 % while at the depth of 40. 0 cm the lithological influence of the SP grains is evident with frequency dependent values above 8. 0 %. From the result, we conclude that the frequency dependent values obtained immediately after the road pavements and on the surface soil of Abuja arise mostly from anthropogenic dust falls of metallic pollutants released mostly from vehicular and industrial activities. While at a distance of about 8. 0 m and depth of 40 cm most of the recorded frequency dependent values arise from the lithological processes of the parent rocks. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} identify the effect of lithological magnetic grains from anthropogenic grains using frequency dependent measurements...|$|E
40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} have become preferred materials {{in a wide}} variety of electronic and mechatronic devices due to their pronounced dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties. The material macroscopic properties are related to the microscopic domain structure of the materials. To understand and predict the relation between the macroscopic properties and the domain structure, a continuum phase field model incorporating with the long-range elastic and electrostatic interactions is employed to simulate the ferroelectric/paraelectric phase transition, polarization switching under external loading, influence of applied strains on ferroelectric and dielectric properties, size effect of ferroelectric epitaxial islands and thin films, effect of long-range elastic interactions on toroidal moment in ferroelectric nanoparticles, and fracture toughness variation induced by domain switching near an electrically permeable crack tip in ferroelectrics. Phase field simulations were conducted to understand polarization switching under external electric or/and mechanical loading. The temporal evolution of the polarization switching shows that the switching is a process of nucleation, if needed, and growth of energy-favorite domains. The simulation results successfully reveal the hysteresis loop of macroscopic polarization versus the applied electric field, the butterfly curve of macroscopic strain versus the applied electric field, and the macroscopically nonlinear strain response to applied compressive stresses. The simulation results show that the paraelectric/ferroelectric phase transition temperature linearly increases with the applied mechanical strain under mechanical clamping conditions. Analogous to the classical Ehrenfest equation, a thermodynamics equation was derived to describe the relationship between the transition temperature and the applied strain. The change in the domain structure with temperature under applied inequiaxial strains is different from that under applied equiaxial strains. The simulations also illustrate the changes in the coercive field, the remanent polarization and the nonlinear dielectric constant with the applied strain. Phase field simulations were also conducted in real space by using different numerical methods, such as finite element analysis and finite difference method to study size effects of epitaxial ferroelectric islands, thin films, and free-standing ferroelectric nanoparticle. The simulations exhibit spatial polarization distributions with different types of domain walls in the epitaxial ferroelectric islands and find two critical thicknesses, at which the simulated material changes from a <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> to a single-domain state and from ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase, respectively. The two critical thicknesses and the domain wall types vary with the length-to-thickness ratio. The remanent polarization and the coercive field of the simulated ferroelectric films both decrease with decreasing film thickness. The phase field simulations on free-standing ferroelectric nanoparticles exhibit vortex patterns with purely toroidal moments of polarization and negligible macroscopic polarization when the spontaneous strains are low and the simulated ferroelectric size is small. However, a monodomain structure with a zero toroidal moment of polarization is formed when the spontaneous strains are high in small simulated ferroelectrics, indicating that, because of the long-range elastic interactions, high values of spontaneous strains hinder the formation of polarization vortices in ferroelectric particles. Phase field simulations were conducted to understand domain-switching-induced shielding or anti-shielding of an electrically permeable crack in a mono-domain ferroelectric material. Phase field simulations give not only the switching zone but also the explicit polarization distribution without any prior assumed switching criterion. The simulation results show that the switching- induced internal stresses shield the crack tip from the applied mechanical loads, resulting in switching-toughening. Although a mechanical load plays a predominant role in the domain switching near the electrically permeable crack, an applied electric field plays also an important role there. When the electric field is parallel to the original polarization direction, it reduces the shielding, whereas an anti-parallel electric field enhances the shielding. The simulated phenomenon is consistent with other theoretical predictions and some experimental observations. Moreover, the phase field simulations exhibit new switching features, such as head-to-tail arrangements of polarizations and appearance of domain walls...|$|E
40|$|Ferroelectrics are {{important}} materials {{due to their}} extensive technological applications, such as non-volatile memories, field-effect transistors, ferroelectric tunneling junctions, dielectric capacitors, piezoelectric transducers, sensors and actuators. As is well known, the outstanding dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties of these functional oxides originate from their ferroelectric domain arrangements and the corresponding evolution under external stimuli (e. g. electric field, stress, and temperature). Electric field has been known as the most efficient stimulus to manipulate the ferroelectric domains through polarization switching and alignment. Therefore, direct observation of the dynamic process of electric field-induced domain evolution and crystal structure transformation is of significant importance to understand the microstructural mechanisms for the functional properties of ferroelectrics. In this dissertation, electric field in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique was employed to monitor the real-time evolution of the domain morphology and crystal structure during various electrical processes: (1) the initial poling process, (2) the electric field reversal process, and (3) the electrical cycling process. Two types of perovskite-structured ceramics, normal ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics, were used for this investigation. In addition to providing the microscopic insight for some well-accepted phase transformation rules, discoveries of some new or even unexpected physical phenomena were also demonstrated. For the initial poling process, microstructural origins for the piezoelectricity development in the three most promising lead-free piezoceramic systems were investigated. For the non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric compositions (x = 6 % - 9 %) in the (1 -x) (Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) TiO 3 -xBaTiO 3 system, well-developed piezoelectricity was realized at poling fields far below the coercive field and phase transition field. Such an unusual behavior is attributed to the electric field-induced irreversible P 4 bm nanodomains coalescence into thin lamellar domains prior to the phase transition. In the (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) NbO 3 -based ceramics, as demonstrated by an archetypical polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) composition of 0. 948 (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) NbO 3 - 0. 052 LiSbO 3, {{the origin of the}} excellent piezoelectric performance is due to a tilted monoclinic phase that emerges from the tetragonal and orthorhombic PPB at the poling fields beyond 14 kV/cm. This monoclinic phase, as manifested by the appearance of blotchy domains and 1 / 2 {oeo} superlattice diffraction spots, was determined to possess a Pm symmetry with a 0 b+c 0 oxygen octahedra tilting and antiparallel cation displacements. For the PPB composition of x = 0. 5 in the (1 -x) Ba(Zr 0. 2 Ti 0. 8) O 3 -x(Ba 0. 7 Ca 0. 3) TiO 3 solid solution system, the original <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> was found to transform into a unique single-domain state with orthorhombic symmetry at very moderate poling fields of 3 ~ 6 kV/cm. This single-domain state is suggested to be primarily responsible for the observed large piezoelectricity due to its significant elastic softening. In the electrical reversal process, a highly unusual phenomenon of electric field-induced ferroelectric-to-relaxor phase transition was directly observed in a lead-free composition of [(Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) 0. 95 Ba 0. 05] 0. 98 La 0. 02 TiO 3. It is manifested by the disruption of large ferroelectric domains with long range polar order into polar nanodomains with short range orders when the polarity of electric field is reversed. This observation was further rationalized by a phenomenological model that takes the large difference in kinetics between the phase transition and the polarization reversal processes into account. During the electrical cycling process, the microstructural mechanisms for electric fatigue behaviors of two ceramics were investigated. In 0. 7 Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 - 0. 3 PbTiO 3, the frozen domain configuration after 103 cycles is responsible for the pronounced functionality degradation. Both seed inhibition and domain wall pinning mechanisms were suggested to be the reasons for the observed fatigue behavior. In the polycrystalline ceramic of [(Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) 0. 95 Ba 0. 05] 0. 98 La 0. 02 TiO 3, a novel phenomenological mechanism of domain fragmentation was found in addition to the domain wall pinning mechanism. Domain fragmentation contributes to the switchable polarization reduction by breaking the long-range polar orders, as visualized by the decomposition of large domains into domain fragments upon bipolar electrical cycling...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} dynamic {{properties}} of magnetic amorphous wires, in particular, glass-coated microwires, which have small diameters (5 - 30 microns), outstanding soft magnetic behaviour with a high permeability and low coercivity, yet, possess a well-defined magnetic structure. First part of my PhD research has been devoted to the investigation of a bi-stable magnetisation reversal in glass-coated amorphous microwires. In contrast to traditional approaches, where characteristics of the magnetisation reversal are analysed as a consequence of the eddy current effect, l have applied stochastic methods for modelling the remagnetisation reversal in the microwires with axial anisotropy. While the eddy current approach, widely discussed in literature, was based on the single domain model, proposed stochastic approach takes into account a <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state</b> of studied samples. A modified stochastic Neel-Brown model of the magnetisation reversal has been proposed enabling the explanation of number of characteristic parameters of the microwires with axial magnetisation. Such important parameters of Barkhausen discontinuity as a mean switching field and a standard deviation of the switching field distribution have been investigated experimentally for understanding the influence of extrinsic factors such as a slew rate of the alternating magnetic field on applications operation. A deep understanding of the remagnetisation process in amorphous the microwires with axial anisotropy was successfully applied in development of a new type of the remote magnetic interrogation system. My reading system allows the large Barkhausen jump to be detected without actual contact between the magnetic microwire and the magnetic field detector. Experiments show that the detection will be possible at a distance of approximately 100 - 150 mm from the detecting sensor. A very low cost and easily repetitive amorphous microwires with axial anisotropy are. incontrovertibly best materials for Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) applications. During the study of the microwires with axial anisotropy and development of the application based on them, I took part in the investigation of unusual coding methods of the amorphous microwires using a localised laser annealing treatment. This treatment produces a multi-pulse code within the wire and therefore adds to the information contained within the wire, improving reliability and security. I developed and used a magnetic interrogation system allowing an accurate and reliable test and analysis of the studied samples. The second part of my PhD research has included investigations of microwires with circumferential and helical anisotropies. The main interest in these materials is due to their applications for high-performance magnetic and stress sensors. Within this research project, the microwires with circumferential/helical anisotropy have been studied in a broad range of frequencies. A number of dynamic effects have been experimentally obtained and analysed. In particular, a detailed investigation of dynamic circular hysteresis (10 kHz- 300 kHz) has been carried out allowing explanation of different behaviour of the materials with circumferential/helical anisotropy at different frequencies. The experimental curves are proposed to be analysed in terms of field dependence of characteristic permeabilities: domain wall displacements (reversible and irreversible) and magnetisation rotation. It was established that these permeabilities have different field behaviour. That explains different MI patterns at relatively low frequencies (less than a few MHz) and relatively high frequencies (more than 10 MHz). Further, some special features of the Magneto-Impedance effect in the microwires with a circumferential anisotropy such as off-diagonal impedance and microwave impedance have been considered. In this research, the former presents a considerable interest for development of linear magnetic sensors and the latter can find application in tuneable microwave materials and devices. As a result of this study several types of linear, bi-directional MI sensors were developed. I also developed new MI sensing approaches (such as off-diagonal response) and a new high performance detection technique allowing us to improve sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity at low cost and simple construction [...] The last part of the PhD research has been devoted to an investigation of the stress-impedance in the ultra high-frequency (UHF) band (300 MHz- 3 GHz). Based on the experimental investigation, a new type of a stress-sensitive composite material is proposed. The microwave effective permittivity of such material depends on mechanical stresses. These composite materials opens up new possibilities for remote monitoring of stress with the use of microwave "free-space" techniques. This kind of composite material can be characterised as a "sensing medium", which images the mechanical stress distribution inside construction or on its surface...|$|E
40|$|Ultrathin {{films have}} become an area at the {{frontier}} of materials science due to their novel properties and new applications. In particular, ultrathin magnetic films and ultrathin organic films are drawing more and more attention. The former {{is associated with a}} series of new phenomena such as giant magntoresistence and oscillatory exchange coupling which enable fabrication of new devices and applications, while the interest in the later is ignited by the promise prospect of molecular optoelectronics and molecular electronics. To make a full use of these films, it is important to learn how to manipulate their growth and how to tailor their properties. The aim of this work was to explore methods efficient for functional modification of these films. (Fe, Ni) bilayers with different individual thickness and different deposition sequences have been investigated experimentally with special attention to the temperature dependence of their magnetic parameters. It is unequivocally found that in (Fe, Ni) bilayers the spin reorientation transition shifts to larger Ni film thicknesses compared with Ni/Cu(100) films. This result is explained by an enhanced demagnetization field when the two magnetic layers with unequal magnetization are put together and possibly by a Fe/Ni in-plane interface anisotropy. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of the coercivity observed in the bilayers strongly suggests the existence of an in-plane anisotropy at the Fe/Ni interface. Magnetic live layers of Fe have been found at the Fe/Ni interface. The magnetic structure of the surface layer of 9 -ML Fe on Ni on Cu(100) is closely related to the thickness of the underlying Ni film. A magnetic live layer with Curie temperature around 230 K is observed when the thickness of Ni layer is chosen to be 10 ML, while it is absent when the Ni thickness increases to 15 ML. The structural relaxation of the Ni layers with thickness is thought to be responsible for the observations. These results provide a further evidence for a sensitive correlation between the structure and magnetism in fcc Fe. The single domain state is not stable for the (Fe, Ni) bilayer with small perpendicular anisotropy. With the withdrawal of the external field, the single domain state gradually relaxes to a <b>multi-domain</b> <b>state,</b> resulting in a decay of remanent magnetization with time. The relaxation behavior disappears when the perpendicular anisotropy is large. An exchange biasing in ultrathin Fe films on Ni/Cu(100) has been observed when the (2 ´ 1) and (4 ´ 1) phase coexist. This biasing could be attributed to the coexistence of AFM and FM domains as observed previously in granular systems. However, with all the direct experimental result objecting the existence of a AFM phase at the studied temperature, a new model is proposed to account for this unusual biased coupling phenomenon. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the strong biquadratic exchange coupling results in an orthogonal coupling between the (2 ´ 1) Fe domains and their underlying Ni layer. By measuring and analyzing the hysteresis loops of Ni/Cu(100) films with several thicknesses at different temperatures, the magnetization reversal mechanisms have also been investigated for Ni/Cu(100) films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The magnetization reversal procedure consists of the nucleation of the reversed domains and the following motion of the domain wall. Which process is the dominant mechanism depends on the temperature and the film thickness. For thick films with large perpendicular anisotropy, the nucleation field, which is correlated to the anisotropy, is greater than the pinning field of most pinning centers. The magnetization reversal is dominated by the nucleation and the reversal procedure can be described by the nucleation followed by the viscous motion of the wall without obstacles, resulting in a high squareness in the shape of the hysteresis loops. With decreasing film thickness, the effective anisotropy field becomes comparable with the effective pinning field. Then the role of temperature becomes important. At high temperature, the motion of the domain wall is thermally assisted and thus easy, so the nucleation of the reversed domain is still the dominant process. At low temperature the pinning effect of the wall motion is visible. Therefore the shape of the hysteresis loop changes from rectangular at high temperature to inclined and round at low temperature. In this case the adsorbed residual gases have a pronounced effect on the reversal procedure acting as pinning centers. The high stability of the magnetic properties of Ni/Cu(100) films with perpendicular anisotropy upon multiple magnetization reversals has been measured and is confirmed by a theoretical analysis. AFM and x-ray diffraction have been used to investigate the growth behavior of perylene films on a (111) -oriented polycrystalline Au substrate, as well as on the same substrate but additionally coated with a self assembled monolayer (SAM) of 1 -Octadecanethiol molecules. It has been found that the perylene molecules have a smaller diffusion coefficient on the SAM than on the Au surface. An additional self-assembled monolayer of 1 -Octadecanethiol molecules on an Au-substrate greatly modifies the properties of the subsequently vacuum deposited perylene films. The grain size becomes smaller and a strong c-axis texture is introduced. Both factors tend to reduce the roughness of the perylene films. These effects are attributed to the changes in the perylene molecule-substrate interaction by the additional self assembled monolayer. To further reveal the unique growth behavior of molecular crystals, perylene have been evaporated on a oil film. The growth speed along the crystallographic [100] axis is found to be dramatically different from that along its opposite [- 100]. The ratio of two growth speed is around 2. 3, and does not show an obvious dependence on supersaturation. This asymmetric growth is believed to has a steric origin, which is special for organic crystals. An organic molecule, which is the unit building block of a organic crystal, consists of a number of atoms and shows a finite size and specific shape. These features complicate the growth behavior of organic crystals. For the growth of perylene crystals on an oil film, the steric environment for a perylene molecule to be incorporate to a crystal is different for [100] and [- 100], resulting in a difference in the growth speed. Interesting growth patterns have also been observed for perylene crystals grown on a oil film. Though it is preliminary, our study indicates that the stress field at the growth interface and especially around a step has significant effects on the growth behavior...|$|E
