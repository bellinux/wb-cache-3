2500|$|In 1994 AVE trains on the Madrid–Seville line {{began to}} run at 300km/h, cutting journey times by at least 40 minutes and {{covering}} the 471km in 2½ hours, though {{it is unlikely that}} much of a saving came from the increase in maximum speed, because only a small section of the line near Los Yébenes has the alignments for 300km/h operation.

Beyond Brazatortas, the line is only authorised for 250km/h operation, which drops to 215km/h in the Sierra Morena mountains and 90km/h around Córdoba station.

50|$|After {{the merger}} of the West and East German {{railways}} to create Deutsche Bahn AG, the large fleet of this very robust and reliable East German locomotive was no longer wanted on German rails. An unusual problem arose with a rolling motion that was traced to the wheel profile. On newly laid and ground rails the engine rocked at high speeds. The Deutsche Bahn finally reduced its <b>permitted</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> to 80 km/h, which meant it could {{be taken out of}} service because this speed was too low for duties on main lines. Individual locomotives were later equipped with special shock absorbers on their bogies to counter the rocking motion.|$|R
50|$|Two {{sections}} between (Junction 23) Llanddulas to (Junction 17) Conwy are {{signed as}} a 70 mph (110 km/h) speed limit because they are classed as non-motorway special roads. Unlike other sections of the A55 that have National Speed Limit (NSL) signage and are accessible to all motor vehicles, motorway restrictions (although it's not a motorway) apply on these stretches of road e.g. no pedestrians, learner drivers, farm vehicles etc. This is because these sections were built under legislation applicable to the building of motorways. But as they {{are not part of}} either the UK motorway network or are classed as an ordinary highway (public right of way), the national speed limit does not apply so 70 mph (110 km/h) signs (the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> <b>permitted</b> on UK roads) are used instead.|$|R
50|$|Altogether {{there have}} been 8 {{versions}} of the Rc-locomotive in Sweden including the freight locomotive Rm designed to pull iron ore trains. Rc1, Rc2, Rc4, and Rc5 have a maximum allowed speed of 135 km/h. Rc3 and Rc6 have a maximum allowed speed of 160 km/h. Rc7 was a rebuild of Rc6 meant to haul replacement trains needed when the X 2000 trains were canceled or delayed. Rc7 had a maximum allowed speed of 180 km/h. However, the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> <b>permitted</b> without emergency electromagnetic track brakes is 160 km/h, and converting the carriages proved too expensive. For that reason all Rc7 were subsequently converted back to Rc6. Rc1-Rc7 all weigh between 75 and 80 tonnes, whilst the Rm weighs 90 tonnes. The Rm's top speed is only 100 km/h, but {{due to the nature}} of their work, they are more powerful locomotives.|$|R

The speed limit north of Dereham is 15mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.|$|R
50|$|Rate-adaptive {{services}} {{were intended to}} offer the best possible speed attainable, which could vary over time. The <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> <b>permitted</b> was determined by current line conditions, the level of noise, and also by recent history based on factors including the rate of communications errors and {{the best and worst}} DSL modem sync speeds achieved during some recent period of time. The highest speed ADSL Max services enabled customers to receive up to 7.15 Mbit/s (termed 'downstream') over a standard BT telephone line of sufficient quality. Various kinds of lower-speed, rate-limited adaptive {{services were}} also available as a reduced cost option. Customers using ADSL Max with long lines, poor quality lines or who experienced high levels of noise or interference are limited to much slower transfer rates, and some customers whose lines are very poor or who are affected by high levels of noise are unable to obtain service at all.|$|R
50|$|The route between Launceston and Padstow was not {{designed}} for speed. The single line route required several sections at a gradient of 1 in 73 {{to allow for the}} rise from near Sea Level at Padstow to a summit at 860 feet above Sea Level between Camelford and Otterham and the line constantly curved, typically with a radius of 30 chains, in order to follow the contours and avoid costly earthworks. The result was a typical journey from Halwill to Padstow that occupied 90 to 100 minutes down and up to 110 minutes in the up direction. These times were reduced over the years with more powerful locomotives so that by the 1940s journey times between Launceston and Padstow were typically 80 minutes in the down direction and 90 minutes in the up.

50|$|Safe {{speed is}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> <b>permitted</b> by the basic speed law and {{negligence}} doctrine. Safe speed {{is not the}} same as the 85 percentile operating speed used by traffic engineers in establishing speed zones. Fog, snow, or ice can create conditions where most people drive too fast, and chain reaction accidents in such conditions are examples of where large groups of drivers collided because they failed to reduce speed for the conditions. The speeds at which most people drive can only be a very rough guide to safe speed, and an illegal or negligent custom or practice is not in itself excusable. Safe speed approximates the inferred design speed adjusted for environmental alterations and vehicle and person specific factors when VACDAs is the limiting factor. The Solomon curve concept can create an approach-avoidance conflict within the driver who wishes neither to drive faster than is lawful and the conditions allow nor have an unsafe speed discrepancy between other vehicles on the road; it is never legal to go faster than the speed limit, and unilaterally reducing the risk of the latter can lead to a mass crash caused by the former.|$|R
