5|$|<b>Molecular</b> {{biology is}} the study of biology at the <b>molecular</b> level. This field {{overlaps}} with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. <b>Molecular</b> biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} <b>molecular</b> {{nanotechnology}} {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of <b>molecular</b> nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing <b>molecular</b> assemblers, which are <b>molecular</b> machines which could robotically assemble <b>molecular</b> materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of <b>molecular</b> assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of <b>molecular</b> nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E
5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their <b>molecular</b> gas content. The majority of <b>molecular</b> gas is <b>molecular</b> hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have <b>molecular</b> gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of <b>molecular</b> gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for <b>molecular</b> analysis. <b>Molecular</b> ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of <b>molecular</b> technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication <b>Molecular</b> Ecology in 1992. <b>Molecular</b> ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, <b>Molecular</b> Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. <b>Molecular</b> ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. <b>Molecular</b> investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, <b>molecular</b> ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, <b>molecular</b> clouds of <b>molecular</b> hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|But for {{the next}} century, without <b>molecular</b> evidence, {{progress}} stalled.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{makes use}} of {{matrices}} in various ways, particularly since the use of quantum theory to discuss <b>molecular</b> bonding and spectroscopy. Examples are the overlap matrix and the Fock matrix used in solving the Roothaan equations to obtain the <b>molecular</b> orbitals of the Hartree–Fock method.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{this body}} of {{research}} established the central dogma of <b>molecular</b> biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since {{been shown to have}} exceptions, such as reverse transcription in retroviruses. The modern study of genetics at the level of DNA is known as <b>molecular</b> genetics.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine {{also offers}} the Doctor of Philosophy degree to train {{students}} as biomedical researchers and scientists. The PhD {{is available in}} six fields offered by the basic science departments: pharmacology and toxicology, <b>molecular</b> and cell biology, immunology, <b>molecular</b> pathogenesis, systems biology, and experimental and <b>molecular</b> medicine. Research and teaching positions at DMS and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a <b>molecular</b> {{study by}} Austin Mast again showed Banksia coccinea {{to be the}} next closest {{relative}} of a group comprising Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri and only distantly related to other members of the series Banksia. This was reinforced in a 2013 <b>molecular</b> study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of <b>Molecular</b> Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for <b>molecular</b> biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with <b>Molecular</b> modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of <b>molecular</b> biology—a model for the <b>molecular</b> basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as <b>molecular</b> hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, <b>molecular</b> emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but <b>molecular</b> hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|Like {{horseradish}} peroxidase, lanthanum {{is used as}} an electron-dense tracer in <b>molecular</b> biology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molecular</b> {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how their cells express their genes as proteinsby applying <b>molecular</b> biology to medical testing. The technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk, and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients.|$|E

5|$|<b>Molecular</b> {{replacement}} – if {{a related}} structure is known, {{it can be}} used as a search model in <b>molecular</b> replacement to determine the orientation and position of the molecules within the unit cell. The phases obtained this way can be used to generate electron density maps.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotides find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in <b>molecular</b> biology and medicine. They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via <b>molecular</b> hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E
5|$|Pre-conference {{tutorials}} {{have played}} an important role in ISMB since the first conference. Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to genetic algorithms, neural networks, AI for <b>molecular</b> biologists and <b>molecular</b> biology for computer scientists. Tutorials on computational mass spectrometry-based proteomics and ENCODE data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|Recovery of DNA {{sequences}} {{longer than}} a few thousand base pairs from environmental samples was very difficult until recent advances in <b>molecular</b> biological techniques allowed the construction of libraries in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which provided better vectors for <b>molecular</b> cloning.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{is based}} on <b>molecular</b> phylogeny of six genes in Flynn, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} <b>molecular</b> biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its {{clinical}} application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as <b>Molecular</b> Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties <b>Molecular</b> Diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of <b>molecular</b> biology, and with it an {{understanding}} of the chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the <b>molecular</b> clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the <b>molecular</b> clock, arguing that—at the <b>molecular</b> level at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of <b>molecular</b> evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought <b>molecular</b> data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations.|$|E
5|$|The rise of <b>molecular</b> {{techniques}} {{at the end}} of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses {{that were}} different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results of <b>molecular</b> studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that <b>molecular</b> data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only <b>molecular</b> differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectroscopy}} of <b>molecular</b> oxygen {{is associated}} with the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited state singlet <b>molecular</b> oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{spectroscopy}} has wide applicability in <b>molecular</b> biology, {{particularly the}} study of photosynthesis. It {{has been used to}} study a wide variety of flowering plants and ferns by researchers in departments of biology, plant physiology and agriculture science as well as <b>molecular</b> genetics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> {{neuroscience}} is {{a branch}} of neuroscience that observes concepts in <b>molecular</b> biology applied to the nervous systems of animals. The scope of this subject covers topics such as <b>molecular</b> neuroanatomy, mechanisms of <b>molecular</b> signaling in the nervous system, the effects of genetics and epigenetics on neuronal development, and the <b>molecular</b> basis for neuroplasticity and neurodegenerative diseases. As with <b>molecular</b> biology, <b>molecular</b> neuroscience {{is a relatively new}} field that is considerably dynamic.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the nervous system can be done at {{multiple}} levels, ranging from the <b>molecular</b> and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels. At the <b>molecular</b> level, the basic questions addressed in <b>molecular</b> neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to <b>molecular</b> signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns. At this level, tools from <b>molecular</b> biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions. The morphology, <b>molecular</b> identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest.|$|E
25|$|Since organic chemists are {{particularly}} interested in <b>molecular</b> structures, it might be useful {{to be able to}} single out individual <b>molecular</b> units interactively from the drawing. Organic <b>molecular</b> units need to be given both as 2D structural formulae and full 3D <b>molecular</b> structures. Molecules on special-symmetry positions need to be reconstructed from the asymmetric unit. Protein crystallographers are interested in <b>molecular</b> structures of biological macromolecules, so that provisions need to be made to be able to represent <b>molecular</b> subunits as helices, sheets, or coils, respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> mass or <b>molecular</b> {{weight is}} {{the mass of}} a molecule. It is {{calculated}} as {{the sum of the}} atomic weights of each constituent element multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the <b>molecular</b> formula. The <b>molecular</b> mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, determines stoichiometry. For large molecules such as proteins, methods based on viscosity and light-scattering can be used to determine <b>molecular</b> mass when crystallographic data are not available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molecular</b> nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} called <b>molecular</b> manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) {{operating on the}} <b>molecular</b> scale. <b>Molecular</b> nanotechnology is especially associated with the <b>molecular</b> assembler, a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis. Manufacturing {{in the context of}} productive nanosystems is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Triplet oxygen, the lowest-energy <b>molecular</b> oxygen species, has two {{unpaired}} {{electrons in}} antibonding π* <b>molecular</b> orbitals.|$|E
25|$|Western {{blotting}} is {{a routine}} <b>molecular</b> biology method {{that can be}} used to semi-quantitatively compare protein levels between extracts. The size separation prior to blotting allows the protein <b>molecular</b> weight to be gauged as compared with known <b>molecular</b> weight markers.|$|E
25|$|Determination of the <b>molecular</b> {{structure}} of hydrogen peroxide {{proved to be}} very difficult. In 1892 the Italian physical chemist Giacomo Carrara (1864–1925) determined its <b>molecular</b> mass by freezing-point depression, which confirmed that its <b>molecular</b> formula is H2O2.|$|E
25|$|In gases, {{adiabatic}} compressibility {{is directly}} related to pressure through the heat capacity ratio (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and <b>molecular</b> weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of temperature and <b>molecular</b> structure important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and <b>molecular</b> structure, but simple <b>molecular</b> weight is not sufficient to determine it).|$|E
25|$|Adamantane {{could be}} used as <b>molecular</b> {{building}} blocks for self-assembly of <b>molecular</b> crystals.|$|E
