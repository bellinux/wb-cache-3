40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied a}} new type of flowmeter, the bypass flowmeter. It is {{suitable}} for large-scale pipes. The principle of bypass flowmeter is studied by analyzing flowing in parallel pipes and carrying out experiments at a modified performance test system for centrifugal pumps. The study results showed that the flowrate ratio between the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and the bypass pipe is determined by the geometric structures of pipes and the flowing states in the pipes. The flowrate ratio varies greatly when the Reynolds numbers are relatively lower both in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and the bypass pipe. The flowrate ratio keeps constant when the Reynolds number in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> is larger than 120000. The head loss becomes smaller when the bypass pipe is connected to the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> The percentage of head loss decrease is from 7. 64 % to 9. 34 %. The results indicate that bypass flowmeter is suitable for flowrate measuring in large scale pipes. It will not cause additional head loss to the flow...|$|R
40|$|Bypass {{pneumatic}} conveying systems provide a passive capability to reduce conveying velocity and therefore reduce attrition and abrasion {{in the process}} of conveying many fragile and erosive particulate solids. Because of these capabilities, bypass {{pneumatic conveying}} systems have been used in coal-fired power stations for removing fly ash {{for the last couple of}} decades. In bypass systems, the differential pressure between bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> as well as the pipeline pressure drop are two of most significant parameters as differential pressure represents the aeration mechanism within the pipeline while pressure drop is an essential parameter for bypass pneumatic conveying system design. In bypass systems, these two parameters are determined not only by the turbulent mode of the gas solids two-phase flow but also by the bypass configurations. The objective of this study was to experimentally investigate the differential pressure between bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> as well as the pressure drop during the bypass pneumatic conveying of fly ash. Pneumatic conveying tests in bypass systems and a conventional pipeline were carried out in this study. The bypass pipeline was a 79 mm diameter <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement. Fly ash was discharged to the system from the bottom of a positive pressure blow tank. The receiving bin was mounted on load cells for measuring the mass accumulation. In order to monitor real time behavior of the system, pressure transmitters were used to measure the gauge pressure. Differential pressure transmitters were employed in the system for measuring the pressure difference between the bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> Differential pressure results between bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> {{in the process of}} conveying fly ash showed that the pressure before the orifice plate in the bypass pipe was higher than that in <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> as a result of orifice plate airflow resistance. Therefore, air came into <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and aerated the material continuously. The differential pressure also illustrated that the particulate may go into the bypass pipe as pressure in the bypass pipe after orifice plate is lower than that in <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> The pipeline pressure drop results also showed that pressure drop was higher than in the conventional system when using the same operating parameters due to the increase of friction. The influences of bypass configurations on pressure drop of bypass system were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} to locate leaks in buried water pipes. However, difficulties are often encountered when attempting to detect a leak in a plastic pipe, as the leak noise signals attenuate very rapidly away from the leak. Identifying suitable sensors which can be easily deployed and are sufficiently sensitive has been problematic. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) wire ring sensors have been proposed and demonstrated successfully in laboratory conditions previously. Here it is proposed that the ring sensor is used in a modified configuration: a flexible hose instrumented with the ring sensor {{is connected to the}} pipe, via a fire hydrant or other standard access point. Some theoretical modelling has been carried out, which predicts that the acoustic pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> transmits well into the sidebranch, whilst the pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> is largely unaffected. This suggests that PVDF wire located on the sidebranch will effectively monitor the pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> Moreover, if the sidebranch is sufficiently flexible, substantial sensitivity gains can be made using this configuration compared with locating the wire on the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements made in the laboratory on a medium density polyethylene (MDPE) finite pipe with a polythene sidebranch connected to it confirm that the acoustic pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> can indeed be measured on the sidebranch. The expected sensitivity gains were not fully realized, and a number of different reasons for this are proposed...|$|R

40|$|The breccia pipes of Cave Peak {{are located}} on the eastern flank of the Sierra Diablo of west Texas. Three breccia pipes intruded along a 1 -mile-long north-south line. The complex {{consists}} of a <b>main</b> <b>pipe,</b> with an associated quartz latite-quartz monzonite porphyry plug, and two smaller breccia pipes, both with associated rhyodacite plugs. The rocks and mineralized zones of the <b>main</b> (northernmost) breccia <b>pipe</b> have been investigated by over 42, 000 feet of core drilling. Intrusion began 39 m. y. ago with emplacement of a small rhyodacite plug and breccia pipe. Farther north of this initial system a middle rhyodacite plug and breccia pipe developed, while immediately adjacent and slightly north of this middle <b>pipe,</b> the <b>main</b> Cave Peak breccia pipe ultimately formed.

40|$|In {{two-phase}} gas/liquid flow, {{the phenomenon}} of maldistribution of the phases occurring downstream of a splitting T-junction has been the topic of investigation of several authors. The negative consequences of this maldistribution on the operation of downstream unit have often led {{to the conclusion that}} T-junctions in two-phase pipelines are to be avoided. However, the large degree of segregation of the phases obtained at the outlets of a T-junction for certain flow rates and geometries, has encouraged Industry and researchers to exploit this simple device as a partial phases separator. In this work, experiments and interpretations are carried out in two experimental rigs, one with a horizontal <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> (0. 127 ID) and the other with a vertical <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> (0 - 076). These consist of measurement of the split characteristic and, in the case of horizontal annular flow, of film thickness. Comparison with predictive models is carried out for the horizontal geometry.

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot plate welding. Sidewall fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the <b>main</b> <b>pipe,</b> rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for sidewall fusion. Adaptor plates that match the outside diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> are applied to the heating plate to perform this type of fusion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{measurement}} method {{of the power}} plant circulating water flow was investigated. When {{the characteristics of the}} circulating water system was calculated through characteristic curve intersection, circulating water pumps were generally assumed to be in parallel and the resistance of <b>main</b> <b>pipes</b> was ignored. In addition, the circulating water flow of each unit was considered equivalent. This method was accurate only when the distance of <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and circulating water pump is shorter. Therefore, the hydraulic computation method combining with pipe network has been proposed with the long distance condition. This method calculates accurately the circulating water flow of each unit.

40|$|Keywords:reducing cross; {{numerical}} simulation; internal flows; {{hydraulic loss}} Abstract. In order tostudy the internal flowsand hydraulic loss of reducing cross, numerical simulation {{was carried out}} on a horizontally installedreducing cross. Three schemes of pipe diameters were studied. The time-averaged N-S equations of three-dimensional steady flows in the reducing pipe were calculated by CFX 14. 5 based on the standard k-ε two equation turbulence model together with standard wall function. The {{results show that the}} higher the inlet velocity, the hydraulic loss become larger when the split ratios are same for the reducing cross. With the uniform inlet velocities the higher the inlet velocity, the quicker the increasing rate of the hydraulic loss in <b>main</b> <b>pipe,</b> as well as the branch pipe. The integral change rules of hydraulic loss are similar with the condition of uniform flow rate inflow when the flow patterns at inlet are uniform. But with the same spilt ratio, the hydraulic loss of uniform velocity inflow is markedly less than that of uniform flow rate inflow in both <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and branch pipe. The bigger the differences of the diameters between the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and the branch pipe, the larger the hydraulic loss of thebranch pipe...|$|R
