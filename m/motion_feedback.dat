Two general methods of engine only control have been studied; manual manipulation of the throttles by the pilot, and augmented control where a computer commands thrust levels in response to pilot attitude inputs and aircraft <b>motion</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> This latter method {{is referred to as}} the Propulsion Controlled Aircraft (PCA) System. A wide variety of aircraft have been investigated. Simulation studies have included the B 720, F- 15, B 727, B 747 and MD- 11.

50|$|EA Sports NASCAR Team Racing is an arcade racing game {{developed}} by EA Tiburon and released by Global VR. The game {{was released on}} August 3, 2007 at the AAMA Gala. Up to four racers (10 with the version 1.1 update) race against {{each other and the}} CPU in one of the major NASCAR tracks (i.e. Daytona International Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, etc.) Damage is visible but does not affect performance (until one crashes), and AI will frequently wreck. However, {{at the end of each}} race the racer receives a halo if they did not try to ram other racers and a pair of red horns if they did.

40|$|LIGO is {{dedicated}} to the detection of gravitational waves. To achieve the design sensitivity of the proposed Advanced LIGO detectors, the seismic isolation system is required to isolate the interferometer mirrors from ground motion above 0. 1 Hz. The dominant source of motion above 0. 1 Hz is the microseismic peaks near 0. 15 Hz. The system needs to isolate the payload from this motion by at least a factor of five in all three translational degrees of freedom. Tilt-horizontal coupling is the most challenging problem for seismic isolation below 1 Hz. Tilt-horizontal coupling results from the principle of equivalence: inertial horizontal sensors cannot distinguish horizontal acceleration from tilt motion. Tilt-horizontal coupling rises dramatically at low frequencies, which makes low frequency isolation difficult. Several techniques are used to address the tilt-horizontal coupling problem. The isolation platform is designed to separate horizontal motions from tilt <b>motions.</b> <b>Feedback</b> control to displacement sensors is used to command the platform in all degrees of freedom. These sensors are “corrected ” by ground seismometers, using an optimal FIR filtering technique to separate tilt noise from horizontal acceleration. With these techniques, we obtaine...|$|R
5000|$|The premier SAC-II game, Shrike Avenger, {{had been}} in {{development}} for three years but a complete game was still months away. Bally Sente replaced the original developer with Owen Rubin and gave him six weeks to make a playable game out of the unfinished prototype. While the cabinet and motion control computer were complete and in-game graphics were nearly done the game itself was unfinished. Rubin quickly developed a playable [...] "Last Starfigher" [...] trainer type flight simulator and the game was put out on field tests. The game used a standard SAC-1 system connected to a powerful Motorola 68000 based motion control computer for <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> through the motorized environmental flight simulator cabinet. It earned very well on field tests but had some major problems. Patrons complained of dizziness (some even became ill), the motors were prone to burning out and one units safety system failed, tipping the unit over, dumping a patron and almost crushing them. Bally deemed the SAC-2 system too expensive to produce (estimated to be $10k a unit in 1986 dollars, easily five times a typical games price) and a possible liability so the project was canceled.|$|E

As an analogy to prosthesis use, we tested {{the relative importance of}} visual and proprioceptive <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> during targeted force-based movement. Thirteen human subjects performed a virtual finger-pointing task in which the virtual finger’s velocity was always programmed to be directly proportional to the MCP joint torque applied by the subject’s right index finger.

40|$|With the {{development}} of moving-based flight simulators in mind, {{a large number of}} researchers have considered human manual control behavior in tasks where the motion of the controlled vehicle can be felt by the pilots. While it is known that the dynamics of the controlled vehicle are a key factor that determines the usefulness of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback,</b> there is no systematic study of the use of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> over a wide range of controlled dynamics. Therefore, this paper describes a human-in-the-loop yaw attitude compensatory tracking experiment that was conducted to evaluate the effects of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> on task performance, as well as the open-loop crossover frequency and phase margin. A gain, a single integrator and a double integrator were selected as the different controlled elements in this experiment, respectively. For the double integrator controlled element, the results confirms the findings of previous studies that the <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> is crucial in improving task performance and increasing the open-loop phase margin for enhanced stability.

40|$|Proprioception plays {{a crucial}} role in {{enabling}} humans to move purposively and interact with their physical surroundings. Current technology in upper-limb prostheses, while beginning to incorpo-rate some haptic feedback, does not provide amputees with proprioceptive information {{about the state of the}} limb. Thus, the wearer must visually monitor the limb, which is often inconvenient or even impossible for some tasks. This work seeks to quantify the potential benefits of incorporat-ing proprioceptive <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> into upper-limb prosthesis designs. We apply a noninvasive method for controlling the availability of proprioceptive <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> in unimpaired individu-als in a human subject study to compare the benefits of visual and proprioceptive <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> in targeted motion tasks. Combined results of the current study and our previous study using a different task indicate that the addition of proprioceptive <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> improves targeting accuracy under non-sighted conditions and, for some tasks, under sighted conditions as well.

40|$|Underactuated {{manipulation}} is {{the process}} of controlling a large number of object degrees-of-freedom with fewer robot degrees-of-freedom. The challenge is to derive <b>motion</b> planners and <b>feedback</b> controllers to control underactuated manipulation. In this paper we study the use of real-time nonlinear optimization for <b>motion</b> planning and <b>feedback</b> control of planar batting manipulation with a one-joint robot. We study two tasks: cyclic juggling of a disk, and control of a disk from one six-dimensional state to another by a sequence of three bats. We show analytically and experimentally that the juggling controller yields a stable limit cycle with a large basin of attraction. The experimental results for state-to-state control are less successful and indicate that more accurate modeling of the impact and flight dynamics are required. 1.

40|$|During {{advanced}} driving manoeuvres, drivers can be {{hypothesized to}} use all the available cues to optimize their performance. Fixed-base simulators are commonly used for training of these advanced driving manoeuvres, {{despite the fact that}} motion cues are not present. In this experiment we hypothesize that <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> improves driver performance and affects the driving control strategy during advanced driving manoeuvres when compared to a situation without <b>motion</b> <b>feedback.</b> A comparison between no-motion car-driving simulation and motion-feedback car-driving simulation is done, by measuring driver performance and control behaviour in a fast slalom. In the fast slalom designed for this experiment, a car drives at 70 Km/h around pylons spaced quite closely at approximately 30 meters apart. The advanced Desdemona motion platform was used in this study. Desdemona’s unique motion system allowed us to create a motion simulation that was almost one-to-one regarding the specific forces and angular rates in the actual car. A new motion cueing algorithm was developed to handle advanced driving manoeuvres like this fast slalom. Twenty subjects successfully drove the fast slalom in both conditions. The results from a paired comparison show that subjects prefer driving with <b>motion</b> <b>feedback.</b> <b>Motion</b> <b>feedback</b> also helped subjects conducting the driving task. The number of accidents was significantly lower in the motion condition, as compared to the no-motion condition. Significant differences in the maximum lateral specific force and in the average speed between the two motion conditions were found also. From the experimental results we conclude that there is a difference in driving advanced manoeuvres in a fixed based simulator as compared to a motion simulator. This difference influences driving behaviour with respect to keeping control over the car and also {{it is clear that the}} driver changes his control strategy...|$|E
40|$|Body sway was {{investigated}} in 20 healthy subjects to determine whether visual input must contain <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> information from the surroundings in order to influence postural control. Posturography was used to record body sway under the following visual conditions: eyes open {{with or without a}} restricted visual field; eyes open in ganzfield white light; eyes open in darkness with a head-fixed visual target; eyes open in darkness; and eyes closed in darkness. Stance was perturbed by means of a pseudorandomly applied vibratory stimulation to the calf muscles. Least sway was found with eyes open in an unrestricted visual field but increased in a restricted visual field. Greatest sway was found without visual <b>motion</b> <b>feedback,</b> i. e. under the following conditions: eyes closed; eyes open in darkness; eyes open in ganzfield white light; and with a head-mounted fixation point. Sway was significantly (p < 0. 05) greater with eyes open in darkness compared with eyes closed during the initial 50 s with perturbations. After 150 s, sway was almost identical under the four test conditions without visual <b>motion</b> <b>feedback.</b> Standing with eyes open in darkness was initially a disadvantage compared with having the eyes closed. The postural control system may be programmed to expect visual feedback information when the eyes are open, which may delay changes in postural strategy...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for <b>motion</b> {{planning}} and <b>feedback</b> control of three-link planar robot arms with a passive rotational third joint. These underactuated mechanical systems are {{shown to be}} fully linearizable and input-output decoupable {{by means of a}} nonlinear dynamic feedback, provided a physical singularity is avoided.

Based on this result, one can plan smooth motions joining in finite time any initial and desired final state of the robot. Moreover, it is easy to design an exponentially stabilizing feedback along the planned trajectory.

40|$|Knowledge of {{how human}} operators’ {{tracking}} behavior {{is affected by}} simulator motion cueing settings is of great value for flight simulator design and fidelity evaluations. Previous studies have revealed strong effects of degraded motion cueing quality on human operator control behavior in compensatory tracking, but the presented visual cues in such studies are often not consistent with what operators perceive in more realistic settings, as they typically {{do not include the}} visual cues provided by the out-of-the-window view from their vehicle. This paper aims to investigate the effects of the interaction of such outside visual cues and of motion cueing settings on human operator behavior. Thereto, an experiment in a flight simulator was conducted in which participants performed a yaw-axis target-following disturbance-rejection tracking task. The presence of an outside visual scene and simulator <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> quality were varied independently. In the experiment, motion cues were either absent or presented with varying attenuation induced by changing the break frequency of a first-order high-pass yaw motion filter. The results indicate a strong effect of outside visual cues on human operator control behavior in the absence of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback,</b> which is comparable to the measured effect of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback.</b> Overall, human operator control behavior was found to be less affected by varying motion cueing settings when the outside visual cues were available in parallel.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of different forms of <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> on the per- ception and control behavior of pilots in a roll-lateral helicopter hover task. To identify this influence, a combined target-following and disturbance-rejection task is carried out where the <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> is varied. The participants perform the control task with roll motion only, lateral motion only, combined roll-lateral motion, or with no motion. A cy- bernetic approach is taken to identify multi-loop pilot describing functions and estimate the parameters of a pilot model. Results show that participants perform significantly bet- ter at the control task with feedback of combined roll-lateral motion, and decrease their control activity. For the condition with feedback of roll motion a similar trend is observed. This is explained through the increased amount of information present in the inner roll stabilization loop...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use the Hess Structural Model to predict the need for certain cueing systems, George and Cardullo {{significantly}} expanded it by adding <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> to the model and incorporating models of the motion system dynamics, motion cueing algorithm and a vestibular system. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate effectiveness of these innovations by performing a comparison analysis of the model performance with and without the expanded <b>motion</b> <b>feedback.</b> The proposed methodology is composed of two stages. The first stage involves fine-tuning parameters of the original Hess structural model in order to match the actual control behavior recorded during the experiments at NASA Visual Motion Simulator (VMS) facility. The parameter tuning procedure utilizes a new automated parameter identification technique, which was developed at the Man-Machine Systems Lab at SUNY Binghamton. In {{the second stage of}} the proposed methodology, an expanded <b>motion</b> <b>feedback</b> is added to the structural model. The resulting performance of the model is then compared to that of the original one. As proposed by Hess, metrics to evaluate the performance of the models include comparison against the crossover models standards imposed on the crossover frequency and phase margin of the overall man-machine system. Preliminary results indicate the advantage of having the model of the motion system and motion cueing incorporated into the model of the human operator. It is also demonstrated that the crossover frequency and the phase margin of the expanded model are well within the limits imposed by the crossover model...|$|E
40|$|The SRES {{scenarios}} forecast {{a significant}} increase in nuclear power. In order to achieve better public acceptance of nuclear power it is at first necessary to reduce the radiotoxic inventory of the spent fuel from LWRs by burning the long-lived actinides. Furthermore, a much more efficient use of the fuel is needed {{to reduce the amount of}} mining, milling and enriching in order to prevent a strong upward pressure on uranium prices. Lead or lead alloy cooled fast reactors are promising regarding actinide burning and self-breeding. The latter allows to keep the burn-up swing low, which is safety-relevant because of no need for much inserted reactivity, and it would also facilitate remote siting due to a several year long irradiation cycle. Heavy metalcooled modular reactors have already been shown to have favorable behavior in severe accident simulations. In the EU, there is an interest in a 600 MWe lead-cooled reactor as part of the Generation IV effort. In this paper, an unprotected loss-of-flow calculation with no negative feedbacks taken into account is shown to lead to a benign behavior. The emergency decay heat removal with ex-vessel air-cooling is demonstrated for a more compact and a more pancake-like core. Furthermore, the MCNP-calculated Doppler, coolant temperature and cladding <b>motion</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are evaluated for both core configurations. Additionally, the change in reactivity during a few years burn-up is calculated for an initial load of spent LWR-UOX fuel.
