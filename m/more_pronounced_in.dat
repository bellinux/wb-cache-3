5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|Into modern times, {{his legacy}} has {{remained}} <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> Ireland and Scotland {{than in his}} native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities.|$|E

5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{climate is}} {{classified}} as arid to semi-arid and temperate to cool temperate. One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and {{is a factor in}} making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> eastern than western areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{average number}} of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an {{aggregated}} distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.|$|E

5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} T.l. ludovicianus {{is similar}} in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped wing coverts, a superciliary streak is less white, a fluffy vent and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) without bars. In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults {{in the same time}} period is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> color than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.|$|E

25|$|Apothecia funnel-shaped, stipitate, rarely sessile, margin {{covered with}} fine, {{inconspicuous}} hairs; hairs fasciculate, less than 3mm long; asci 300–40017–20µm; ascospores ellipsoid, biguttulate, surface with fine longitudinal ridges, 25–2913–15µm. This species has <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> variations <b>in</b> color, and {{is thought to}} represent a species complex.|$|R
50|$|First instar larva are {{initially}} translucent white, becoming opaque white. The second instar is integument {{black and}} the third instar has jet black setae. The verrucae of the fourth instar are <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> than <b>in</b> previous instar. When mature, female larva are about {{twice as large as}} male larva.|$|R
5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> N. rajah {{than in any}} other Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> the rear dorsals.|$|E

This effect is even <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population {{as of the}} 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4million during the day.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{cognitive}} abilities, one study {{has shown that}} morphine may {{have a negative impact}} on anterograde and retrograde memory, but these effects are minimal and transient. Overall, it seems that acute doses of opioids in non-tolerant subjects produce minor effects in some sensory and motor abilities, and perhaps also in attention and cognition. It is likely that the effects of morphine will be <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> opioid-naive subjects than chronic opioid users.|$|E
