5|$|This is the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are made; two (parallel) {{walls of}} very thick wooden (planking) are raised, {{and across the}} space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and {{those parts of the}} hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> taught him Classics. Instead he developed {{a keen interest in}} Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E

5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, and the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

The calculation is very involved, even for relatively small rockets. In all cases, the assumptions in the calculation become the limits {{on the day of}} launch. For example, if a vehicle is analyzed for malfunction turn due to thrust offset, and the assumed wind in the model is 30 kn, then one of the GO/NO GO criteria on the day of launch will be a <30 knot wind.

25|$|Ibn Jamāʻah, in his abridgement, divided {{these terms}} into four {{different}} categories according to subject (and adding six {{terms in the}} process). The first pertains to the matn (text) of the hadith and its three divisions and 30 types. The three divisions are ṣaḥīḥ, ḥasan, and ḍa`īf. The thirty types include those mentioned in hadith terminology and others. The second deals with the isnād (chain of narration) and comprises 11 types. These types generally fall within the discipline of biographical evaluation. The third category includes six types: the qualifications necessary for conveying hadith, the <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are transmitted, the transcription of hadith, and the etiquette of the narrator and of the student. The fourth category, which comprises 21 types, relates to {{the names of the}} narrators.

25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions and forensic reports. Police had noted (and {{would continue to}} note) common denominators in the physical characteristics of the victims, and the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> died: all of the victims had been brunette Caucasians; each (excluding Mixer) had been the recipient of extensive violence inflicted with a blunt and/or bladed instrument prior to her murder; each of the victims' bodies had been found within a 15-mile radius of Washtenaw County; and each victim (again excluding Mixer) had received knife wounds to the neck. Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied around her neck, and each woman had been menstruating {{at the time of}} her death. These factors led police to publicly conclude the same perpetrator was responsible for at least three of the murders thus far committed.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes {{the need to be}} aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E
25|$|Ships {{were first}} {{constructed}} {{in a very}} basic <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> used reeds. These ships were in no way able to travel in the Red or Mediterranean Sea, and so their purpose was only to navigate through the Nile. Whenever ships were required to endure longer travels, Egypt often imported cedar wood from Byblos, with whom they had good trade relations. At the same time, they would ask other states that they traded with to supply them with {{a certain number of}} ships. This is exemplified in the Amarna letters where we find a request to the King of Cyprus to construct ships for the Egyptian navy. By the time of the Battle of the Sea Peoples, the Egyptians had become experts in constructing ships. Their ships had a single mast with a horizontal square sail on it. One bow was usually decorated with a human skull being crushed by a lion’s head. These ships often had two rudder oars, since built in rudders were not invented at the time. At the same time, they could have been as heavy as 70 or 80 tonnes with around 50 rowers.|$|E
40|$|Capture of {{bacteria}} with flexible carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{was done in}} vitro. Bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was mixed with Streptococcus mutans. Precipitation assays and colony-forming unit formation assays showed free S. mutans in the solution was significantly decreased {{by the addition of}} the CNTs. Observation of the precipitate by scanning electron microscopy showed bacterial adhesion to CNTs. It has been shown that CNTs of different diameters have significantly different effects on the precipitation efficiency, and the <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> capture the cells are different. We found that MWCNTs (diameter of approximately 30 nm) had the highest precipitation efficiency, which was attributable to both their adequate dispersibility and aggregation activity. From observations by scanning electron microscopy, bundles of SWCNTs and thin MWCNTs (diameter of approximately 30 nm), which were moderately flexible, were easily wound around the curved surface of S. mutans. Bare CNTs having high adhesive ability could be useful as biomaterials, e. g., as tools for the elimination of oral pathogens at the nano-level...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} of short stories studies the elements of genre fiction and applies them to literary fiction. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror have specific <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> speak to an audience. By using these elements, for example the desensitization of the current generation of readers to most horrors, an author can demonstrate the core of the human relationship to pain, faith, or hope. Though some genre fiction seems to fit certain formulas, there are also horror or science fiction stories which do not fit a conventional mold. This collection sets forth to break away from genre fiction conventions. Also, this project utilizes the genre of magical realism, which is the medium between genre fiction and literary fiction, by using fantastic events within a mundane setting to emphasize the author's ideas. By bridging the gap between genres, magical realism reveals how interrelated the elements of all genres are. In this study stories use magical and horrifying events while maintaining an intention beyond the formulaic thrill. Therefore, genre fiction can have a place amongst literature.

I examine the production, consumption, and disposal histories of condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps, intrauterine devices, and hormonal birth control. Production, consumption, and disposal of the birth control methods I study have determined physical experiences with both our bodies and with the non-human natural world, but those three processes have also shaped discourse about nature and bodies. Likewise, discourse about nature and bodies helped to determine which contraceptives were made, how they were made, who had access to them, the <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> could be used, {{and what happened to}} them when humans were done with them.
