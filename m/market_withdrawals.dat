Instead, we construct an implicit contracts model where we account for both the firm and the worker incentives. Displacements occur only when joint utility of the two parties are greater for displacement than for continued employment. We use a firm-worker -panel to test two implications of our model. First, we find that firms target their layoffs on employees who lose least when displaced. This targeting is more frequent in firms in financial distress and during a recession. Second, we find that a change in a disability risk affects also the displacement probability. This is due to differences in experience rating for the disability and unemployment pensions.

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of postwar black/white earnings ratios {{have found a}} more rapid rate of increase in the period since 1964 than before. The reason for this acceleration is unresolved. One view is that federal equal-employment activities have increased the relative demand for black labor. An alternative view is that rising relative earnings reflects (1) reductions in relative supply and (2) the "statistical" effect of low earners raising median earnings by withdrawing from the labor market. This study differs from previous work on the subject in two ways. First, the restrictions on the universe from which published median earnings data by race are calculated are discussed explicitly. The restrict ion most commonly addressed in previous work (having positive earnings in the year in question) {{is found to be}} less important than an undiscussed restriction (being employed as a wage and salary worker the following March). Second, data on the distribution of earnings are used to determine the effect of labor market dropouts on median earnings, instead of trying to estimate this effect (as well as demand and supply effects) from time series data. This permits comparison of "corrected" and "uncorrected" post- 1964 trends. For males, about half of the "uncorrected" trend remains after the relative earnings variable is corrected for labor <b>market</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> For females, between half and four fifths remains. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} answers {{three questions}} in urban and labor economics. Chapter 1 investigates {{under what conditions}} wealthy, high-skilled landowners wind up worse off when they use housing regulations to make their communities harder for poorer, low-skill workers to move into. If there is labor complementarity in production between high-skill and low-skill workers, low-skill workers will have lower productivity when they cannot advantage themselves of neighborhood effects, which in turn will hurt high-skill workers. Chapter 2 asks whether rent control, a strong form of housing regulations, incentivizes landlords to evict their tenants when the unregulated rents rise. Exploiting a known price shock to different residential buildings throughout San Francisco over an 11 year period, I find that a 2 % increase in prices leads to a 1 % increase in the monthly probability of an eviction from a controlled unit. The analysis also highlights the perverse incentives created by rent control, that medium-term (3 - 5 year) <b>market</b> <b>withdrawals</b> increase when prices increase. Chapter 3 studies whether grandchildren change their grandparents' labor force participation, and then researches whether the fall and rise in labor force participation between 1970 and 2009 can be ascribed to {{the rise and fall}} in grandparenthood due largely to the Baby Boom.

We describe their weight loss efficacy, mode of action at both pharmacological and behavioural levels, where understood, together with the range of side effects that might be expected in clinical use. We have however evaluated these compounds against the considerably more rigorous criteria that are now being used by the Federal Drugs Agency and European Medicines Agency to decide approvals and <b>market</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> Several trends are evident. Recent advances in the understanding of energy balance control have resulted in the exploitation of a number of new targets, some of which have yielded promising data in clinical trials for weight loss. A second major trend is derived from the hypothesis that improved weight loss efficacy over current therapy is most likely to emerge from treatments targeting multiple mechanisms of energy balance control. This reasoning has {{led to the development of}} a number of new treatments for obesity where multiple mechanisms are targeted, either by a single molecule, such as tesofensine, or through drug combinations such as qnexa, contrave, empatic, and pramlintide. +. metreleptin.

40|$|Optimisation of the {{incorporation}} of chitosan in orange juice was accomplished by the evaluation of quality and nutritional markers. Response surface methodology was applied to obtain quadratic and second degree response surface model equations. The analyses showed that increases in chitosan concentration extended {{the quality of the}} orange juice signiﬁcantly (p < 0. 05), reducing enzymatic and non-enzymatic browning and controlling the spoilage during the storage time; however, concentrations N 1 g L− 1 produced a signiﬁcant (p < 0. 05) reduction in the concentrations of ascorbic acid and carotenoids associated with the positive charge of chitosan and its ability to ﬂocculate and coagulate negatively charged substances. Also, concentrations N 1 g L− 1 were scored as unacceptable for the sensory panel due to an increase in bitterness. The study recommends the use of chitosan at concentrations up to 1 g L− 1 to extend quality and preserve ascorbic acid and carotenoids during storage time of fresh orange juice, thus avoiding the use of standard thermal treatments which produces a negative impact on the nutritional value. Industrial relevance: One of the major problems of fresh orange juice is its limited shelf-life. Spoilage and quick degradation of vitamins are two of the most important causes of quality loss during the shelf-life of this product. Moreover, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to consumers against drinking unpasteurised orange juice products because of the potential contamination with Salmonella typhimurium and its association with an outbreak of human disease caused by this organism [FDA issues nationwide health alert on Orchid Island unpasteurised orange juice.

40|$|Serious drug-drug {{interactions}} {{have contributed}} tohalf {{of the recent}} U.

Many of these in-teractions involved inhibition of metabolizing en-zymes and efflux transporters, resulting in increased systemic exposure and subsequent adverse drug reac-tions. In other cases, induction of cytochrome P 450 en-zymes and/or transferases and transporters resulted in reduced systemic exposure and a risk of loss of efficacy of coadministered drugs.

A recent survey 1 indicated that in the UnitedStates,multipledruguse is common.

40|$|Background: Pharmacovigilance is an {{important}} tool to gather real-life information on effectiveness and adverse effects of drugs. Therefore, post-marketing study can lead to new therapeutic insights or even <b>market</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> In September 2004, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market for reasons of serious cardiovascular safety. Objectives: Our objective {{was to examine the}} effect of withdrawal rofecoxib on the prescription of overall NSAIDs, coxibs and traditional NSAIDs (t-NSAIDs). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using pharmacy dispensing data from IADB. nl (50 pharmacies), covering a Dutch population of 500, 000 subjects. The study cohort consists of patients who filed at least one prescription NSAIDs 6 month before and after 30 th September 2004. The control cohort was defined 12 months prior to study cohort with setting a hypothetical date at 30 th September 2003. Results: After <b>market</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of rofecoxib, no difference was found in overall number of NSAID users in the study cohort (prevalence 51. 4 and 50. 4 per 1000 population before and after withdrawal, respectively). For the control cohort, this pattern was essentially similar (55. 9 and 55. 0 per 1000 population, respectively). The prevalence of coxib users decreased significantly from 178 to 89 among 1000 NSAIDs users before versus after withdrawal. The prevalence of coxib users increased significantly from 110 to 142 among 1000 NSAID users in the control cohort. The withdrawal of rofecoxib led to increased use of t-NSAIDs (from 83 % to 92 %) as prescribers switched to this alternative agent. In contrast, this trend was not found in control cohort. Conclusions: <b>Market</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of rofecoxib did not affect overall use of NSAIDs. However, a significant decline of coxib use was found led to an increased proportion of t- NSAID users. Further results will be presented on switching patterns with focus on concomitant use of proton-pumpinhibitors for gastrointestinal protection...|$|R
