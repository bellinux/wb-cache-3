40|$|Many {{advertisers}} {{adopt the}} integrated marketing communications per-spective {{that emphasizes the}} importance of synergy in planning multi-media activities. However, the role of synergy in multimedia communica-tions is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how adver-tisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multi-media communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive the-oretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on <b>media</b> <b>budget,</b> media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the <b>media</b> <b>budget</b> but also allocate more funds to the less effective activ-ity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspend-ing. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the context}} of sighted wine appreciation, {{previous}} studies indicate that extrinsic cues like price and area-of-origin have a marked effect on the sighted ratings proffered by tasting experts. While these expert ratings are widely employed by the wine media as proxies of genuine quality, it remains uncertain whether such expert ratings, in turn, serve to influence the public in their own sighted assessments of wine quality. To {{determine the influence of}} the expert rating cue in the public's sighted appreciation of wine, a tasting-room experiment was held in which 32 subjects assessed seven wines first blind and then sighted. During the sighted tasting the only (additional) cue-information made available was the expert rating conferred by the South African annual wine-guide known as John Platter. An interrogation of the resultant database of 224 paired blind and sighted wine assessments reveals {{the extent to which the}} expert rating cue consistently mediates the sighted appreciation of wine, this particularly within the younger, less experienced demographic. An examination of the meta-model's driving coefficients suggests that in explaining sighted quality, expert ratings appear to operate at five times the strength of the original intrinsic (blind) assessment. For marketers, this finding suggests (1) that the promotion of this extrinsic cue be targeted more specifically at wine "novices", and (2) that this narrowing of marketing focus implies a more judicious and effective employment of <b>media</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The current article {{analyzes}} the difficulties faced by public service {{media in the}} current political, economic and multimedia context. It proceeds with {{an examination of the}} main financing methods used by public service media and of the most recent reforms at the European level. The last part of this article describes a potential “scenario” of reforming public service media license fee model through the dynamics of civic crowdfunding, allowing citizens to decide in which programs they may invest a (20 %) quota. The scenario we have built is framed {{in the direction of a}} “digitally enabled collaborative economy” (Kostakis and Bauwens, 2014), where citizens can experiment with a form of participation in media that is no longer “content-related” but “structural” (Carpentier, 2011). In order to prove the value of this hypothesis, the model has been tested on 649 Italian citizens. This test demonstrated that, although 83 % of the survey sample believe the current cost of the Italian license fee is too high, 70 % of them would be willing to pay even more if they could be in control of a part of the license fee and decide where to invest it. Therefore, we have shown that our sample of Italian citizens and Internet users is favorably disposed toward forms of more structural participation in the decision-making processes of public service media and in the co-management of public service <b>media</b> <b>budgets.</b> The aim of the current article is to demonstrate the potential value of audience’ structural participation in reshaping the role of public service media in contemporary digital cultures and networked societies...|$|R

The study shows that although, the circulation of Malay magazine is far higher than English, their advertising revenue is lower. The lower rate of cost-per-thousand (CPM) for Malay magazine in addition to the generally lower quality of readership's demography is contributing to the lack of interest from the advertisers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{patterns}} of acquisition and use of microcomputer software in Arizona high school library media centers, and to determine the selection procedures used by the library media specialists or other designated personnel responsible for the library media centers. The instrument used in this study was a survey developed and reviewed by a committee of school library media specialists. Subjects selected as the target population were 130 Arizona high school library media specialists. The procedures used for testing the 13 hypotheses were: (1) point biserial correlation coefficients, (2) t-tests, and (3) frequency distributions. Significant findings were indicated for the analysis of data of six hypotheses. The conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) As the size of the student body increases, the availability of microcomputer software for library management purposes also increases. (2) As the size of the library <b>media</b> <b>budget</b> increases the availability of microcomputer software for library management purposes also increases. (3) A negative relationship between the size of the library media center budget and the intention to obtain microcomputer software for school-wide purposes presented an anomaly for the intuitive approach to the analysis. (4) The methods chosen for evaluating and selecting microcomputer software varied significantly for each type of software selected. (5) Cell means indicated that for each type of library management programs obtained by the library media center, three school-wide programs were obtained.
