5000|$|The thinner {{the traps}} are created, the less visible they will be. Therefore, the trap width {{should be set}} to a strict minimum, {{dictated}} by {{the maximum amount of}} <b>misregistration</b> or error margin of the whole production workflow up to the printing press. Since the printing technology {{and the quality of the}} paper are the most important causes for <b>misregistration,</b> it is possible to come up with some rules of thumb. E.g., for quality offset printing, it is generally accepted that the trapping width should be between 1 and 1/2 print dots. When printing at 150 lpi, the traps should be between 1/150 and 1/300 inch (0.48 pt and 0.24 pt, 0.16 mm and 0.08 mm). These values are usually multiplied with a factor of 1.5 or 2 when one of the colors is black. First of all, the trap will not be visible since the lighter color will be spread underneath the - almost - opaque black. For the same reason, in many cases, black ink will be set to [...] "overprint" [...] colors in the background, eliminating the more complex process of [...] "spreading or choking". Since black is a very dark color, white gaps caused by <b>misregistration</b> will be more visible. On top of that, in wet-in-wet offset printing black is the first color to be laid down on paper, causing relatively more distortion of the paper, thus at higher risk of showing <b>misregistration.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of intensity clustering and shading correction on mutual information based image registration is studied. Instead of the generally used equidistant re-binning, we use k-means clustering {{in order to achieve}} a more natural binning of the intensity distribution. Secondly, image inhomogeneities occurring notably in MR images can have adverse effects on the registration. We use a shading correction method in order to reduce these effects. The method is validated on clinical MR, CT and PET images, as well as synthetic MR images. It is shown that by employing clustering with inhomogeneity correction the number of <b>misregistrations</b> is reduced without loss of accuracy thus increasing robustness as compared to the standard non-inhomogeneity corrected and equidistant binning based registration. © 2005...|$|R

However, a stay-away should be created for the supporting color to prevent <b>misregistration</b> from revealing the undercolor {{at the edges of the}} rich black object.

However, getting the areas of activation at the individual subject level is still an open issue. The standard massively univariate statistical analysis is usually performed after smoothing the data and makes use of a single p-value for final thresholding of the results [1]. In group fMRI studies, the need for compensation of cross-subjects <b>misregistrations</b> clearly justifies the smoothing. However, at the individual level, where neat delineations of the activated areas are of interest, the use of gaussian smoothing as a pre-processing step is more questionable.

40|$|Spatial <b>misregistration</b> of {{multispectral}} scanner data exists when two (or more) spectral band signals supposedly representing {{the same location}} are in fact data values generated from two (or more) overlapping or entirely different ground locations. <b>Misregistration</b> can be found to occur between scanner data channels due to inherent scanner system characteristics and between time periods of multitemporal data due to errors in spatial registration.

40|$|<b>Misregistration</b> between multitemporal {{remotely}} sensed {{images is}} one of the significant sources of change-detection errors. In this study, spatial distribution of change-detection errors induced by <b>misregistration</b> was analysed quantitatively. First, multitemporal images are registered with different <b>misregistration</b> values measured by root mean square error (RMSE) from 0 to 1 pixels. The image differencing method, {{one of the most widely}} used change-detection methods, is then used to detect changes. Finally, the spatial distribution pattern of change-detection errors caused by <b>misregistration</b> is analysed using buffering analysis based on multitemporal image edges. Experimental results indicate that the commission errors caused by <b>misregistration</b> values from 0 to 1 pixels are almost always within 1 pixel of the edge, regardless of image resolution. In addition, the omission errors falling within 1 pixel of the edges are about 70 % for medium-resolution images. The omission errors falling within 1 or 2 pixels of the edges for high-resolution images can be as much as 50 % to 60 %. This work improves the understanding of spatial distribution of change-detection errors caused by <b>misregistration</b> and shows the relations between these errors and image edges. Moreover, it is helpful for developing new methods by combining edge and spatial information to reduce the adverse effects of <b>misregistration</b> on change-detection.

40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of remote sensing is to carry out {{monitoring}} programmes such as land‐cover change detection. However, the accuracy of such change detection activities can be limited by several factors. A key variable that can limit the accuracy of change detection is the <b>misregistration</b> error between the images used. Although the impacts of <b>misregistration</b> on change detection have been considered in various studies, a single global value for <b>misregistration</b> has typically been applied across the whole scene. The effect of <b>misregistration,</b> however, varies spatially {{and its effects on}} change detection could be more accurately predicted and ultimately removed if this spatial variation in error were modelled. The current study aimed to develop a model that described the spatial variation of <b>misregistration</b> for airborne image data. As <b>misregistration</b> is a function of geometric error, the geometric errors associated with the airborne data were modelled and this geometric error model was used to derive a model of <b>misregistration.</b> The impacts of various navigational variables on the accuracy of the automated geocorrection of compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) data were evaluated. A significant relationship was found between geometric error and angular acceleration (adjusted r 2 = 0. 651; p = 0. 017). The relationship between geometric error and angular acceleration together with a model of orthometric errors was used to derive an error model that described the spatial variation in geometric errors associated with the automated geocorrection of the CASI data. This model gave a probabilistic description of the spatial variation in geometric error. From the geometric error model, a model of <b>misregistration</b> between CASI images from two times was derived. This model was tested using data from an urban test site and a significant correlation, at 95 % confidence, was found between predicted and measured <b>misregistration.</b> The models derived could be used in change detection, potentially reducing the impact of geometric errors and so <b>misregistration</b> in airborne sensor data, which is a major limitation in the use of remote sensing for environmental monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{normalization}} is a {{key element}} of statistical parametric mapping and related techniques for analysing cohort statistics on voxel arrays and surfaces. The normalization process involves aligning each individual specimen to a template using some sort of registration algorithm. Any <b>misregistration</b> will result in data being mapped onto the template at the wrong location. At best, this will introduce spatial imprecision into the subsequent statistical analysis. At worst, when the <b>misregistration</b> varies systematically with a covariate of interest, it may lead to false statistical inference. Since <b>misregistration</b> generally depends on the specimen’s shape, we investigate here the effect of allowing for shape as a confound in the statistical analysis, with shape represented by the dominant modes of variation observed in the cohort. In a series of experiments on synthetic surface data, we demonstrate how allowing for shape can reveal true effects that were previously masked by systematic <b>misregistration,</b> and also guard against misinterpreting systematic <b>misregistration</b> as a true effect. We introduce some heuristics for disentangling <b>misregistration</b> effects from true effects, and demonstrate the approach’s practical utility in a case study of the cortical bone distribution in 268 human femurs. ...|$|E
