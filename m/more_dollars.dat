5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of <b>more</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1971 {{more and}} <b>more</b> <b>dollars</b> were being printed in Washington, then being pumped overseas, {{to pay for}} {{government}} expenditure on the military and social programs. In {{the first six months}} of 1971, assets for $22 billion fled the U.S. In response, on 15 August 1971, Nixon issued [...] pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, unilaterally imposing 90-day wage and price controls, a 10% import surcharge, and most importantly [...] "closed the gold window", making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly, except on the open market. Unusually, this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own State Department, and was soon dubbed the Nixon Shock.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{under the}} rules {{governing}} monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), seigniorage on bank notes is simply defined as the interest payments received by central banks on {{the total amount of}} currency issued. [...] This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting <b>more</b> <b>dollars</b> into circulation. [...] However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole seigniorage profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.|$|E
2500|$|The United States enjoys many {{benefits}} because the dollar {{serves as the}} international reserve currency. The United States could not face a balance of payments crisis as American debts are denominated in dollars, thus the Federal Reserve could simply print <b>more</b> <b>dollars.</b> [...] In other words, the United States cannot suffer a debt crisis, per se, but would instead face an inflation crisis. The cost of producing a dollar to the United States is simply the cost of printing the note, whereas a foreign government must provide a dollar’s worth of goods for that dollar; {{the difference between these}} two values is called seigniorage and its benefits go directly to the American government. [...] Further, the United States dollar's position in the world allows the American federal government to borrow money at exceptionally low interests rates due to high demand for the dollar. This phenomenon is generally called [...] "exorbitant privilege" [...] and allows the United States to run a balance of payments deficit [...] "without tears," [...] as French economist Jacque Rueff said.|$|E
2500|$|Personal {{income was}} {{at an all-time high}}, and <b>more</b> <b>dollars</b> were chasing fewer goods to purchase. This was a recipe for {{economic}} disaster that was largely avoided because Americans—cajoled daily by their government to do so—were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in war bonds that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges—an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid ¾ of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar, and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation. Americans were challenged to put [...] "at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special [...] "Minuteman" [...] flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the [...] "Ten Percent Club". There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{evolution}} of dollar denominated accounts in Latin Amer-ica and how they impact {{the stability of the}} banking system as well as the volatility of macroeconomic aggregates. Our findings reveal that dollar deposits are strongly in-fluenced by depreciation expectations. We also find that having <b>more</b> <b>dollar</b> accounts increases the probability of future crises if the economy is already in a crisis, these crises are persistent. Finally, our findings suggest that there is higher volatility in some macroeconomic aggregates in the long and short run as the volume of dollar denominated accounts increases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{show that}} investors with <b>more</b> <b>dollar</b> amount {{allocated}} to private equity conduct more thorough due diligence and have different investment criteria. The fraction allocated to private equity, the organization’s total asset under management, and other investor characteristics that broadly capture prestige, experience, and long-term relationship do not explain {{these differences in}} effort and beliefs. We also document several novel facts that contribute to opening the blackbox of the investment process in alternative asset classes. An implication of our results is that the emergence of gigantic institutional investors may come with a radical change in the beliefs and actions of the marginal investor. ...|$|R
