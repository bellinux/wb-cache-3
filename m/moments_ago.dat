In response, Standing was immediately shot in forehead [...] "directly above the nose". Another member of the mob then pointed to Clawson and said [...] "Shoot that man." [...] Clawson folded his arms and said [...] "Shoot." [...] Although he appeared calm and maintained composure, he nearly passed out in the anxiety of the moment. For reasons unknown, the same man who <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> told the mob to shoot Clawson now said [...] "Don’t shoot." [...] As Clawson examined Standing, one man said; [...] "This is terrible; that he should have killed himself in such a manner," [...] claiming that Standing accidentally shot himself [...] "while bringing his weapon into position." ...|$|E
