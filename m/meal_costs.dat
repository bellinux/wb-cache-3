During the 1904/05 season, Aberdare won the Glamorgan League by beating Treorchy in the last match. Rees claimed that Treorchy had agreed to lose the game for £15.|$|E

40|$|Background: Room {{service is}} a foodservice model that has been {{increasingly}} implemented across health care facilities {{in an effort to}} improve patient satisfaction and reduce food waste. In 2013, Mater Private Hospital Brisbane, Australia, was the first hospital in Australia to implement room service, with the aim of improving patient nutrition care and reducing costs. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} comprehensively evaluate the nutritional intake, plate waste, patient satisfaction, and patient <b>meal</b> <b>costs</b> of room service compared to a traditional foodservice model. Design: A retrospective analysis of quality-assurance data audits was undertaken to assess patient nutritional intake between a facility utilizing a traditional foodservice model and a facility utilizing room service and in a pre-post study design to assess plate waste, patient satisfaction, and patient <b>meal</b> <b>costs</b> before and after the room service implementation. Participants: Audit data were collected for eligible adult inpatients in Mater Private Hospital Brisbane and Mater Hospital Brisbane, Australia, between July 2012 and May 2015. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were nutritional intake, plate waste, patient satisfaction, and patient <b>meal</b> <b>costs.</b> Statistical analyses performed: Independent samples t-tests and χ 2 analyses were conducted between pre and post data for continuous data and categorical data, respectively. Pearson χ 2 analysis of count data for sex and reasons for plate waste for data with counts more than five was used to determine asymptotic (two-sided) significance and n- 1 χ 2 used for the plate waste analysis. Significance was assessed at P 3 ̆c 0. 05. Results: This study reported an increased nutritional intake, improved patient satisfaction, and reduced plate waste and patient <b>meal</b> <b>costs</b> with room service compared to a traditional foodservice model. Comparison of nutritional intake between a traditional foodservice model (n= 85) and room service (n= 63) showed statistically significant increases with room service in both energy (1, 306 kcal/day vs 1, 588 kcal/day; P= 0. 005) and protein (52 g/day vs 66 g/day, P= 0. 003) intake, as well as energy and protein intake as a percentage of requirements (63...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{analysis on}} the growing and feeding of high-oil corn (HOC) to pigs was conducted. The cost to produce HOC is about 25 to 32 cents per bushel higher than for normal corn (NC), primarily due to 7 to 10 percent yield reduction for HOC. Diets made with HOC contain between 1. 5 and 3 percent additional fat. Therefore, feed efficiency should be improved, on average, by 3 to 6 percent when HOC is substituted for NC. In most cases, daily gain should improve by 0 to 3 percent with HOC in the diet. High-oil corn grown in central Nebraska during 1997 averaged 6. 2 percent oil (12 percent moisture). When HOC (6. 2 percent oil) is used to replace NC in growing-finishing pig diets, it is worth 21 to 25 cents more than NC, assuming NC and 44 percent protein soybean <b>meal</b> <b>cost</b> $ 2. 50 per bushel and $ 250 per ton, respectively. When NC and soybean <b>meal</b> <b>cost</b> $ 2 per bushel and $ 200 per ton, HOC is worth 17 to 20 cents more than NC. If HOC is used to replace animal or vegetable fat in pig diets, it is worth about 40 cents per bushel more than NC, if supplemental fat costs 20 cents per pound. The only economic benefit given to HOC {{was an increase in}} feed efficiency. These results suggest no current economic incentive for producers to grow and feed HOC...|$|R

Analysis of data from a large national sample reveals that after controlling for differences in SFA characteristics, sharp differences in costs remained among rural, urban, and suburban SFAs and across regions.
