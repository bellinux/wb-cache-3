500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> <b>room,</b> I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing. '" ...|$|E
