40|$|Hine's Emerald Dragonfly is {{a member}} of the family Corduliidae, the {{emeralds}} and baskettails. This species was first described by E. B. Williamson from a site in northern Ohio in 1931. Subsequently, the species was virtually unknown to most people and few specialists. It was not until the 1990 s that attention was given to refinding this species and associating it with the proper habitats. As a result of prelimi-nary surveys, in 1995 it was given protection under the Endangered Species Act, and is now on the Federal Endangered Species List. This listing spurred an effort to document the existing sites for Somatochlora hineana and to search for new populations. As a result of the efforts by a few Odonata researchers, we now have a much better idea of the range and biology of Hine's Emerald. This note presents a summary of its biology and distribution with aids to identification. BIOLOGY & HABITAT Somatochlora hineana is a species restricted to calcareous areas where limestone lies close to, or at the surface, often overlain by a sandy or <b>marly</b> <b>soil</b> type. Larvae (= nymphs) are found in cool, shallow slowly-moving waters, which consist of spring-fed marshes, alkaline fens (= seepage sedge meadows), mineral-rich fens with shallow creeks, springs, small pools, and marl deposits and calcareous marshy streams. Many of these areas have small channels where the water moves very slowly through cattails and sedges. Recent work has shown that larvae often spend considerable periods of time within crayfish burrows (Cambarus diogenes) during the day, and these same burrows provide refuge for larvae during droughts. Once the adults emerge, they may be found within a kilometer of the breeding sites. Males establish small breeding territories which they defend against other males and sometimes even other species of dragonflies. They typicall...|$|E
40|$|In many sub-{{tropical}} {{and tropical}} and {{regions of the}} world, <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> (marls) and lime or cement stabilization of marl soils are used as a convenient and expedient means for development of foundation base courses and inexpensive wearing courses for transport purposes. The failure {{of many of these}} natural and stabilized marls to perform their function have been reported. This study uses physico-chemical (reaction) factors to explain the general basic causes for deterioration of the support capability for these types of soil. The presence of palygorskite and sepiolite in marl soils provides it with some very unique features in its natural state, and particularly when it is stabilized with lime or cement. Formation of an expansive mineral ettringite as a transformation product of palygorskite increases the swelling potential of the stabilized soil. The exact mechanism of these failures is still not well known. Reactions between lime, alumina (released from the clay fraction of soil) and sulfates present in the soil pore fluid can cause the formation of ettringite. The possible contribution of palygorskite and sepiolite to the post-stabilization failure due to ettringite formation were investigated. It is shown that the general geotechnical/physical criteria used to evaluate stabilized soil performance not be reliable for the evaluation of stabilized marl due to the possible formation of ettringite and its resultant behaviour. A set of physico-chemical studies, which include specific surface area measurements (SSA) and x-ray diffraction (XRD), are needed for a more complete and realistic evaluation of the long-term stability of stabilized marl. In this study, a soil washing method for extraction of pure palygorskite or clay fraction from the soil mixture is developed and validated by XRD analysis. Based on the presented results, the pervious classification of <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> is developed and a new classification for <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> is proposed. Following establishment of the significant role of palygorskite and sepiolite, through the experimental studies, the current XRD techniques for quantitative mineral analysis of clay soils are evaluated. The accuracy of these methods are investigated by preparation of a series of artificial soil mixtures. Finally, a quantitative XRD method for <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> and ettringite is presented. In the last part of this study, the major difference in the kinetics of ettringite when artificially formed is compared with that of a stabilized soil, and the role of sulfate, alumina, and calcium on the ettringite formation is investigated. Furthermore, for soil stabilization, the contribution of different clay minerals in ettringite formation is investigated. Among the clay minerals studied, palygorskite was found to be the most rich in alumina, providing the highest source of alumina for ettringite formation. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{susceptibility}} measurement is {{a simple}} and quick technique for characterizing soils and sediments and describing soil-forming processes. The interpretation of soil magnetic susceptibility data needs sufficient knowledge about the factors affecting this parameter. To identify the effects of parent material, gypsum and calcium carbonate equivalent, 42 samples were taken from horizons of soils developed on loessial, alluvial, granitic and marly materials in southern Mashhad. Gypsum and carbonates of soil samples were removed by successive washing with distilled water and diluted HCl, respectively. Magnetic susceptibility of bulk samples (lfbulk), gypsum free samples (lfGf), gypsum and carbonates free samples (lfGCf) and gypsum, carbonates and sand free samples (lfGCSf) was measured. The results revealed a strong 1 : 1 correlation between the measured and calculated lfGf and lfGCf. Despite the high amounts of gypsum and carbonates in soils developed on marls, their lfbulk {{was much more than}} that of the other soils and reached up to 121. 8 × 10 - 8 m 3 kg- 1. In contrast, the lfbulk values of saprolitic granite were less than 10. 4 × 10 - 8 m 3 kg- 1. The lfbulk values of loessial and alluvial soils were less than those of <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> but higher than those of soils developed on saprolitic granite. lfbulk values were negatively correlated with the amount of sand. However, reduction in magnetic susceptibility values of <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> after removing sand reflects the different nature of this soil. The correlation between lfbulk and amount of silt and clay is positive, but the magnetic susceptibility values are more sensitive to clay percentage, indicating the more important contribution of clay to magnetic susceptibility values. The results of this study highlight the role of parent materials, gypsum and carbonates in the soil magnetic susceptibility values that should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion is extreme in Mediterranean {{orchards}} due {{to management}} impact, high rainfall intensities, steep slopes and erodible parent material. Vall d'Albaida {{is a traditional}} fruit production area which, due to the Mediterranean climate and <b>marly</b> <b>soils,</b> produces sweet fruits. However, these highly productive soils are left bare under the prevailing land management and <b>marly</b> <b>soils</b> are vulnerable to soil water erosion when left bare. In this paper we study the impact of different agricultural land management strategies on soil properties (bulk density, soil organic matter, soil moisture), soil water erosion and runoff, by means of simulated rainfall experiments and soil analyses. Three representative land managements (tillage/herbicide/covered with vegetation) were selected, where 20 paired plots (60 plots) were established to determine soil losses and runoff. The simulated rainfall was carried out at 55 mm h - 1 {{in the summer of}} 2013 (2 circular plots. The results showed that vegetation cover, soil moisture and organic matter were significantly higher in covered plots than in tilled and herbicide treated plots. However, runoff coefficient, total runoff, sediment yield and soil erosion were significantly higher in herbicide treated plots compared to the others. Runoff sediment concentration was significantly higher in tilled plots. The lowest values were identified in covered plots. Overall, tillage, but especially herbicide treatment, decreased vegetation cover, soil moisture, soil organic matter, and increased bulk density, runoff coefficient, total runoff, sediment yield and soil erosion. Soil erosion was extremely high in herbicide plots with 0. 91 Mg ha - 1 h - 1 of soil lost; in the tilled fields erosion rates were lower with 0. 51 Mg ha - 1 h - 1. Covered soil showed an erosion rate of 0. 02 Mg ha - 1 h - 1. These results showed that agricultural management influenced water and sediment dynamics and that tillage and herbicide treatment should be avoided. </p...|$|R
40|$|Samples of red {{and white}} wine {{together}} with corresponding soils from the domestic vineyards of the continental Croatia were selected for analysis. Vineyard soil cover (Stagnosols and Rendzina) is developed over the Plio-Quaternary non-consolidated deposits (gravel, sand, silt, clay) or <b>marly</b> limestones. Within <b>soils</b> overlying non-consolidated deposits containing clays pH value range from 5. 4 to 6. 6, whereas maximum measured pH of 7. 5 is attributed to <b>soil</b> developed over <b>marly</b> limestones. <b>Soil</b> and wine samples {{was determined by the}} total content of copper and iron using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Results are compared to the maximum permitted concentrations (MPC) by the relevant Croatian regulations. Copper concentrations are elevated within all measured wines (from 1. 7 × to 2. 0 × with respect to MPC) and two soil samples (up to 2. 4 × with respect to MPC), due to extensive use of agrochemicals in the vineyards. Increased concentrations of iron within wine and corresponding soil were determined at locality with low soil pH (5. 5). Preliminary research demonstrates a plausible link between the content of elements within soils developed over a specific lithology and associated wines. Increased copper concentration within wines of domestic production points to need for education of population in line with use of eco-agrochemicals. Further extensive studies with detailed physico-chemical processing of soil samples are needed (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Heathland {{vegetation}} {{of northern}} Spain, {{included in the}} Calluno-Ulicetea, was studied using a set of 802 phytosociological releves, The existing syntaxonomy has been tested {{and most of the}} types (associations and subassociations) fit satisfactorily with the observed groupings. Two main problems were encountered within the Ulex dominated communities of the Cantabrian fringe and the Castilian-Cantabrian heathland communities. Both groups of communities were subject to ordination in order to clarify relationships between them, For the former group, ordination suggests that three associations can be distinguished: the Ulici-Ericetum vagantis (lowlands up to the submontane belt), the vaccinio-Ulicetum gallii for the communities of higher altitudes (montane belt) and the Ulici-Ericetum ciliaris (hygrophilous heathlands). The Castilian-Cantabrian heathlands show a variable Mediterranean influence and have a dispersed distribution due to lithological conditions. This results in the distinction of two new associations, viz. the Arctostaphylo crassifoliae-Daboecietum cantabricae (<b>marly,</b> water-retaining <b>soils)</b> and the Ericetum scopario-vagantis (sandy soils). A complete classification of the Calluno-Ulicetea in the studied area and short ecological and biogeographical diagnoses are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the some experimental field data on the unsaturated unstable slope constituted with a <b>marly</b> clay <b>soil</b> showed that the swelling and collapse phenomena were {{the origin of the}} landslide problem. In the studied case, field investigation data and laboratory tests based on the water retention curve determination were analysed. The recorded pore-water pressure field helped us to identify the hydrological conditions. In fact, the wetting and drying cycles involve the total suction and the degree of saturation changes. To predict the shallow slope failure, a constitutive model taking into account the suction effect as well as their dependence on degree of saturation is proposed. It is especially remarkable that the collapse phenomenon is well reproduced when the model incorporates suction changes and saturated preconsolidation stress. The {{analysis of}} the slope failure, basing on the field data and the theoretical study, shows the hydraulic and mechanical effects.

40|$|The {{potential}} risks of geological CO 2 storage {{must be understood}} and geologists are required to predict how CO 2 may behave once stored underground. As natural geological accumulations of carbon dioxide occur in many basins in Italy and volcanic and seismically active areas allow CO 2 rich fluids to migrate to the near surface, many of these areas have been investigated in order to study long-term geochemical processes that may occur following geological storage of anthropogenic CO 2. A study representing an example of "leaking" system is the Solfatara crater (Campi Flegrei, Southern Italy) characterised {{by the presence of}} both CO 2 rich-waters and fumarole. Soil gas flux measurements show that the entire area discharges between 1200 and 1500 tons of CO 2 a day. Most part of analysed waters is the effect of a mixing between a shallow meteoric water and a deep thermal Na-Cl end-member and/or seawater, resulting in sodiumchloride waters. A high dissolved CO 2 content (max value 566. 28 cc/l) is also present. Furthermore, the Campi Flegrei frequently undergo bradyseism related to the elastic response of the shallow crust to increasing pressure within a shallow magma chamber. The study of this phenomenon could be useful to detect ground deformation linked to geomechanical changes in a geological CO 2 reservoir. In contrast, an example of "non-leaking" system is the Pisticci oil and gas Field (Southern Italy) where a great variety of hydrocarbons traps are formed by horst and tilted blocks in the Mesozoic carbonate substratum covered by an almost continuous sequence of Lower Pliocene marls and Middle Pliocene-Pleistocene <b>marly</b> blue clays. <b>Soil</b> gas surveys were performed after a MD 4. 5 earthquake and two years later to test the permanence of the gas distribution pattern. CO 2 distribution in soil gas seems not to be affected by changes in stress, as suggested by the average values of both surveys. The principal aim of our research has been to evaluate and mitigate risks for local populations as the studied areas are densely populated. To date, the obtained results suggest that gas uprising is generally well localised around restricted areas, often controlled by local tectonics (faults and/or fractures). This implies that, in the frame of geological CO 2 sequestration, it is necessary to carefully assess the presence of pathways (fault and/or fractures) that might allow the migration of CO 2 out of the reservoir...|$|R
