5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} and salads, olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E

In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of these}} factors, {{performances}} of Wagner's {{works in the}} modern state of Israel did not occur during the twentieth century, by consensus. In recent years <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> have argued {{that it is possible}} to appreciate his musical talents, without implying acceptance of his political or social beliefs. A public performance in Tel Aviv in 2001 of Wagner’s prelude to Tristan und Isolde, conducted as an unprogrammed encore by Daniel Barenboim, left its audience partly delighted, partly enraged.|$|E
25|$|Territorial Therapy, the {{ideation}} {{of migration}} or yerida, {{is often a}} psychological outlet or mechanism utilized by <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> to counter the stress {{of living in a}} dangerous political situation in the Middle East.

It is estimated that 400,000–800,000 Israeli Jews have immigrated to the United States since the 1950s, though this number remains a contested figure, since <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> are originally from other countries and may list their origin countries when arriving in the United States.|$|E
25|$|For {{his role}} in the {{creation}} of the Oslo Accords, Rabin was awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres. The Accords greatly divided Israeli society, with some seeing Rabin as a hero for advancing the cause of peace and some seeing him as a traitor for giving away land they viewed as rightfully belonging to Israel. <b>Many</b> <b>Israelis</b> on the right wing often blame him for Jewish deaths in terror attacks, attributing them to the Oslo agreements.|$|E
25|$|According to {{demographer}} Pini Herman, this {{circular migration}} {{has been an}} economic boon to Israel. Israel {{does not have the}} technological, academic, and other infrastructural resources to absorb its disproportionate number of highly trained and skilled population, second only to the United States. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> have worked overseas for extended periods of time. Upon their return, they have often attracted or repatriated with them to Israel new infrastructure, such as that provided by companies like as Intel, Google, Microsoft, and IBM.|$|E

25|$|Program founders Yaron Binur, Anat Binur, and Assaf Harlap {{became aware}} that <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> and Palestinians never {{get a chance to}} {{interact}} with one another on a personal level, even though they grow up and live a few short miles from one another. Inspired by their experiences of multicultural cooperation in international educational institutions, the founders decided that a fast-paced, intensive program in technology would be an ideal medium to bridge the divide. With this vision, they created MEET in the summer of 2004.|$|E
25|$|Sharon's complex ground {{maneuver}} {{is regarded}} as a decisive move in the Yom Kippur War, undermining the Egyptian Second Army and encircling the Egyptian Third Army. This move was regarded by <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is widely viewed as the hero of the Yom Kippur War, responsible for Israel's ground victory in the Sinai in 1973. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.|$|E
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a Palestinian state, in September 2000 the Second Intifada (uprising) broke out, a period of {{intensified}} Palestinian–Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians, and has been more deadly than the first Intifada. Many Palestinians consider the Second Intifada to be a legitimate war of national liberation against foreign occupation, whereas <b>many</b> <b>Israelis</b> consider it to be a terrorist campaign.|$|E
