Though monitoring {{is viewed as a}} key quality assurance tool, little research has been devoted to understanding the behavior of monitors—specifically, their ability to provide effective and consistent feedback on interviewer performance. To explore monitors’ behavior, Mathematica Policy Research designed a <b>monitoring</b> <b>consistency</b> exercise that addressed the following questions: (1) What typical behavioral issues do monitors focus on when evaluating interviewers? (2) What criteria do monitors use to rate interviewers? (3) Are monitors coding non-standardized interviewer behavior accurately and consistently? and (4) What is the extent of monitor variation within each monitor (drift across monitoring sessions) and between monitors (differences in leniency and severity between different monitors) ?

Student time sheets, modeled on industrial engineering accounting practices, were utilized as a data source to investigate several related relationships. They covered three terms stretching from Fall 05 through Winter 06. The data covers 115 students working in 29 design teams on 9 different projects. Patterns of student work input were studied {{in relationship to}} distribution of work within teams, variance in work input among different projects, pace of work {{over the course of}} a term and relationship between work input and project grades.

We have developed a method for distinguishing and discriminating common genotypes of E. granulosus s. l. (G 1, G 3, and G 6) in Iran. This method is based on polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting curve (HRM), ramping from 70 to 86 C with fluorescence data acquisition set at 0. 1 C increments and continuous fluorescence <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Consistency</b> of this technique was assessed by inter- and intra-assays. Assessment of intra- and inter-assay variability showed low and acceptable coefficient of variations ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 17 %. Two hundred and eighty E. granulosus s. l. isolates from sheep, cattle, and camel were {{used to evaluate the}} applicability and accuracy of the method. The isolates were categorized as G 1 (93, 94, and 25 %), G 3 (7, 4, and 4 %), and G 6 (0, 2, and 71 %) for sheep, cattle, and camel, respectively.

With these techniques, patients hold their breath while radiotherapy is delivered, pushing the heart down and away from the radiotherapy field. Despite clear dosimetric benefits, these techniques are not yet in widespread use. One {{reason for this is that}} commercially available solutions require specialist equipment, necessitating not only significant capital investment, but often also incurring ongoing costs such as a need for daily disposable mouthpieces. The voluntary breath-hold technique described here does not require any additional specialist equipment. All breath-holding techniques require a surrogate to <b>monitor</b> breath-hold <b>consistency</b> and whether breath-hold is maintained.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} low-dimensional {{model is}} considered to simulate time-dependent dynamics in nonlinear dissipative systems governed by PDEs. The method combines an inexpensive POD-based Galerkin system with short runs of a standard numerical solver that provides the snapshots necessary to first construct and then update the POD modes. Switching between the numerical solver and the Galerkin system is decided ‘on the fly’ by monitoring (i) a truncation error estimate and (ii) a residual estimate. The latter estimate is used to control the mode truncation instability and highly improves former adaptive strategies that detected this instability by <b>monitoring</b> <b>consistency</b> with a second instrumental Galerkin system based on {{a larger number of}} POD modes. The most computationally expensive run of the numerical solver occurs at the outset, when the whole set of POD modes is calculated. This step is improved by using mode libraries, which may either be generic or result from former applications of the method. The outcome is a flexible, robust, computationally inexpensive procedure that adapts itself to the local dynamics by using the faster Galerkin system {{for the majority of the}} time and few, on demand, short runs of a numerical solver. The method is illustrated considering the complex Ginzburg Landau equation in one and two space dimensions...|$|E

All infants were singletons. Recommendations during the study period (1992 - 1994) were for daily use for 23 hours per day. Measurements were average daily hours of use and consistency of use (daily or variable). Gestational age, maternal age, and socioeconomic status as measured by receipt of public assistance were also recorded.  RESULTS—Siblings of SIDS were monitored for fewer hours than were premature or ALTE infants. Only 54 % of sibings of SIDS were monitored daily, compared to 87 % of premature infants and 93 % of ALTEs. Within each diagnostic category socioeconomic status did not affect average hours of <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Consistency</b> of use was more evident in those with private insurance, although the trend did not reach significance.  CONCLUSIONS—Parents of infants with apnoea of prematurity or ALTE are highly compliant with cardiorespiratory monitoring recommendations in the first month of monitor usage.

The ELISA is a well established immunoassay, with clear guidelines for validation when used as a quantitative assay. However, these parameters {{may not always be}} relevant for a semi-quantitative assay used to assess whether a sample is positive or negative for a novel marker such as an antibody developed against a therapeutic antibody. We report here the development of a quantitative PK ELISA and a semi-quantitative HACA ELISA, and the different approaches of validation to prove each assay are ‘fit for purpose. ’ The parameters of linearity (R 2 > 0. 99), accuracy (± 30 %), lowest level of detection (4 ?g/ml), intra-assay (coefficient of variation (CV) 0. 99), lowest level of detection, intra (CV < 10 %) and inter-assay (CV < 30 %) variability were assessed using a surrogate positive control. The validation outcome showed that each assay was robust, reliable and accurate to meet the requirements of the intended analytical application, that being to 1) quantitatively determine the concentration of antibody in the serum and 2) determine whether a sample is positive or negative for human anti-chimeric antibodies.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this doctoral research {{was to examine the}} impact of acute care reform and its implications for health system and provider outcomes in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. A second objective was to identify the best predictor models of, health care provider outcomes (organizational commitment, intent to/ stay, and health care quality) at different phases of the reform process. Registered nurses, the largest group of employees in the acute care sector, were selected as the exemplar for model testing. [...] This doctoral research was comprised of three empirical studies, each of which led to manuscripts for publication. The first study was an examination of the perceptions of system reform on health care providers (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, management personnel) conducted between 1999 and 2000. The second empirical study was are-survey of health care providers between 2001 and 2002. In the third study in 2005, the focus was on documenting registered nurses' changes in perceptions of health care reform and attitudes from previous years and <b>monitoring</b> <b>consistency</b> of predictors of final outcome (perceived health care quality, organizational commitment, intent to stay). Collectively, the three studies and the resulting five manuscripts constitute a thesis that forms the basis for an ongoing and future program of research for monitoring perceptions and attitudes over time and the consistency of predictors of outcome for all health care providers. [...] The findings indicate that restructuring had a negative impact on health care providers' perceptions of the emotional climate, practice issues, collaborative relations, trust in employer, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, intent to stay and health care quality that was observed at all time periods. Key aspects of organizational culture emerged as significant predictors of intermediate (trust in employer and general job satisfaction) and final outcome for registered nurses. Health care provider perceptions of, the organizational culture and reactions to organizational change may, also have important implications for their health status, job performance, productivity and sick leave usage, as well as ultimately for organizational outcomes such as service quality, efficiency and costs. [...] This research based evidence has major health policy implications for three levels: macro (governments), meso (regional health boards, senior leadership and managers of institutions, public) and micro (individual health care providers, professional bodies/unions). Innovative strategies to promote and enhance organizational culture (emotional climate, collaborative relations, and practice issues) may ultimately lead to higher levels of job satisfaction, trust in employer and organizational commitment, greater intent to stay, and more positive perceptions of health care quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the Earth’s global gravity field {{is one of the}} main tasks of Geodesy: it serves as a reference for geodesy itself, and it provides important information about the Earth, its interior and its fluid envelope for all geosciences. Thus, it is important to make the models of the global gravity field available to the public as products of geodesy. This becomes increasingly important as time variations of the global gravity field can be measured with better and better spatial and temporal resolution. The calculation of the different functionals of the geopotential (e. g. : geoid, gravity anomaly, gravity disturbance, equivalent water height) from a defined global model, on a specified grid and with respect to a defined reference system, is far from being trivial and a responsibility of geodesy too. Additionally, it is important to make the spatial structure and temporal variability of the global gravity field available to the general public in a graphic vivid manner. In particular for temporal gravity models, aspects of consistency in processing, reference frame, and parameterization are becoming more and more important.
