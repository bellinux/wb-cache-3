In this paper, {{it is the}} first time that {{chelation}} ion chromatography is applied to analyse lanthanides in a series of samples in agriculture. This technique can eliminate bulk quantity of alkali, alkaline earth metals on chelating concentrator column (MetPac CC- 1) and eliminate transition metals on cation exchange column (TMC- 1) from complex matrices with ammonium acetate buffer while lanthanides are concentrated.

40|$|The rapid {{determination}} of lanthanides in complex matrices {{has been developed}} by an on-line sample pretreatment of chelation ion chromatography. In the present system, selective chelating resin and sulfonated cation exchanger concentrated lanthanides while eliminating bull. quantities of alkali, alkaline earth and transition metals from sample matrices. The concentrated lanthanides which were separated on a <b>mixed-bed</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> column were eluted by a concentration gradient of oxalic acid (Ox) and diglycolic acid (DGA), coupled with postcolumn spectrophotometric detection with 4 -(2 -pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) at 520 nm. The overall analysis time after sample digestion was less than 55 min.

40|$|To get {{information}} about the surface charge, potentiometric and conductometric titrations {{have been carried out}} on monodisperse latices. Using these methods, strong acidic groups were detected for latices prepared in the presence of strong acid soaps. Similarly, for latices prepared with weak acid soaps, weak acidic groups were observed even after several purifications with <b>mixed-bed</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins used in a batch procedure. The influence of the soap chain length on the surface charge has been investigated. An increase of the hydrophobic part of the soap leads to higher surface charges. Furthermore, surface charge-ionic strength relationships were established, which allowed us to calculate the surface dissociation constant of the weak acidic groups. The problem of the origin of surface charge has also been considered by comparison between the aforementioned data and information from molecular weight distribution of the polystyrene chains obtained by gel permeation chromatography. Other latices prepared in the same experimental conditions as for emulsion polymerization but without any soap were also studied. © 1975. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The results {{obtained}} with three surface spectroscopic methods (XPS, ISS, and static SIMS with quadrupole or time-of-flight analyzers) {{available for the}} characterization of the particle surface of polystyrene latexes have been compared. The main point was to quantify the desorption of the surfactants used in the emulsion polymerization (Aerosol MA and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate) by the study of both unpurified and purified latexes. A comparison was made between these results and those obtained on a latex prepared by emulsion polymerization without any tensioactive stabilizer, therefore bearing only sulfate groups issued from the initiator. Sodium dodecyl sulfate {{was used as a}} reference for the presence of sulfate groups. The pure emulsifiers were also investigated separately. The various samples were analyzed as either powders or films, and the {{results obtained}} on films are discussed in terms of the migration of the surfactant toward the interface during the preparation of the films.

40|$|In proteomics, {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} peptides mixtures necessitates multiple dimensions of separation prior to mass spectrometry analysis to reduce sample complexity {{and increase the}} dynamic range of analysis. The main goal of this work was to improve the performance of (online) multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) in terms of sensitivity, compatibility and recovery. The method employs weak anion and strong cation <b>mixed-bed</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography (ACE) in the first separation dimension and reversed phase chromatography (RP) in the second separation dimension (Motoyama et. al. Anal. Chem 2007, 79, 3623 – 34.). We demonstrated that the chromatographic behavior of peptides in ACE chromatography depends on both the WAX/SCX mixing ratio as the ionic strength of the mobile phase system. This property allowed us to replace the conventional salt gradient by a (discontinuous) salt-free, pH gradient. First dimensional separation of peptides was accomplished with mixtures of aqueous formic acid and dimethylsulfoxide with increasing concentrations. The overall performance of this mobile phase system was found comparable to ammonium acetate buffers in application to ACE chromatography, but clearly outperformed strong cation exchange for use in first dimensional peptide separation. The dramatically improved compatibility between (salt-free) ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase chromatography–mass spectrometry allowed us to downscale {{the dimensions of the}} RP analytical column down to 25 μm i. d. for an additional 2 - to 3 -fold improvement in performance compared to current technology. The achieved levels of sensitivity, orthogonality, and compatibility demonstrates the potential of salt-free ACE MudPIT for the ultrasensitive, multidimensional analysis of very modest amounts of sample material...|$|E
