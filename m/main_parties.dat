Although Hezbollah had joined the new {{government}} in 2005, it remained staunchly opposed to the March 14 Alliance.

5|$|In 1949, the Federation of Independents (VdU) {{was founded}} as a {{national}} liberal alternative to the main Austrian partiesthe Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), successors to the interwar era Marxist and Christian Social parties. The VdU was founded by two liberal Salzburg journalistsformer Nazi Germany prisonerswho wanted to stay clear of the mainstream socialist and Catholic camps and feared that hostility following the hastily devised postwar denazification policy (which did not distinguish between party members and actual war criminals) might stimulate a revival of Nazism. Aiming to become a political home to everyone {{not a member of}} the two <b>main</b> <b>parties,</b> the VdU incorporated an array of political movementsincluding free-market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, all of whom had been unable to join either of the two <b>main</b> <b>parties.</b> The VdU won 12% of the vote in the 1949 general election, but saw its support beginning to decline soon afterward. It evolved into the FPÖ by 1955/56 after merging with the minor Freedom Party in 1955; a new party was formed on 17 October 1955, and its founding congress was held on 7 April 1956.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, a referendum on independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} Scottish Parliament. An all-party commission chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E
5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals {{splintered}} Labour emerged {{to become the}} party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E

5|$|Hall saw {{the double}} {{dissolution}} {{as an opportunity}} to capture senate seats in all the states across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM's attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam's dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, the media was almost completely focused on the two <b>main</b> <b>parties,</b> giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> {{to the civil}} war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government {{had no choice but to}} endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E

5|$|Until the Parliament Act 1911, {{there was}} no way to resolve contradictions between the two houses of {{parliament}} except through the creation of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped opposition—William IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Grey—creating an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major bone of contention between the two <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> since the 1830s, was—following intervention by the queen—passed by the Lords in 1869 after W.E. Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave the Lords a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.|$|E
5|$|ITAK {{had four}} main aims: {{creation}} of a federal union in Ceylon with two states - a Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern provinces and a Sinhalese state in the remaining seven provinces; cessation of state-sponsored colonisation in the two Tamil provinces; unity amongst the Tamil speaking peoples of Ceylon - Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils and Muslims; and equal status for Sinhala and Tamil languages. Chelvanayakam lost his seat in the 1952 parliamentary election but regained it in the 1956 parliamentary election. As Ceylon's two <b>main</b> <b>parties,</b> the UNP and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), introduced policies which further discriminated against the country's minorities, such as the Sinhala Only Act which made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, ITAK's Tamil nationalism became more popular than the ACTC's conservatism. In the 1956 parliamentary election the ITAK overtook the ACTC as the most popular party amongst Ceylon Tamils. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, led by Chelvanayakam, staged a satyagraha (a form of non-violent resistance) against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a Sinhalese mob as the police looked on, and ITAK MPs E. M. V. Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in Beira Lake.|$|E
25|$|All three <b>main</b> <b>parties</b> {{went into}} the general {{election}} having changed leaders since 2005.

Nick Clegg was elected as leader of the Liberal Democrats in December 2007, succeeding Menzies Campbell who had replaced Charles Kennedy in January 2006.
