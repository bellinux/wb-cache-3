When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS.

5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head {{as a sign of}} renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E

25|$|In this performance, Abramović {{sought to}} re-evoke {{the energy of}} extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire {{at the start of}} the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When {{finished}} with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> intervened and extricated her from the star.|$|E

25|$|All {{hostages were}} kept in the {{auditorium}} and the orchestra pit {{was used as a}} lavatory. The situation in the hall was nervous and it frequently changed depending on the mood of the hostage-takers, who were following reports in the mass media. Any kind of misinformation caused hopelessness among the hostages and new aggression among their captors, who would threaten to shoot hostages and blow up the building, but no major disasters took place during the siege. The gunmen let <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> make phone calls. One hostage used her mobile phone to plead with authorities not to storm the auditorium, as truckloads of police and soldiers with armored vehicles surrounded the building.|$|E

The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> sitting in the front row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
