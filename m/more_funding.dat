5|$|On May 26, mine owners {{met again}} with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado City. The owners {{agreed to provide}} <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> to allow the sheriff to raise 1,200 {{additional}} deputies.

5|$|The two Texas schools quickly {{began to}} {{battle over the}} limited funds that the state {{legislature}} made available for higher education. In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain <b>more</b> <b>funding.</b> Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E

5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} provide <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> for food banks and other charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed {{to make it to the}} Senate floor.|$|E
5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. Thomas E. Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E

5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Joseph M. Wilson, {{a lawyer}} by trade with degrees from Amherst College (B.A.), the University of Pennsylvania (M.A.), the University of Southern California (J.D.), and Harvard University (M.A.), was {{appointed}} principal {{and with the}} support of alumni and parents, was able to secure <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> and additional autonomy from the Baltimore City Public Schools. Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, {{and the quality of the}} colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto National Post reported on its search for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.|$|E
5|$|The Reagan {{administration}} {{largely ignored}} the AIDS crisis, which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, {{the same year}} Reagan took office. AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months of the epidemic, when more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E

These behaviors suggest that non-diversifiable noise-trader risk increases the <b>more</b> <b>funds</b> are mispriced and that market participants are not only aware of this unique risk factor but demand a compensatory rate of return that varies with its magnitude. ...|$|R
5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham provided <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> for the experimental farm, the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an experimental farm in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest state fair and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans for equipment purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a steady supply of food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} experimental farm was annexed by the school.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{described}} {{the election of}} judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported {{increasing the number of}} judges. He supported giving more authority to law enforcement, including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant, making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence, and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns. Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry. He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending, which was shown to discriminate against African Americans. In 2008, Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up. The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted. The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House. A bill preventing consumers from taking out more than one loan at a time passed the House in 2009. Ford supported offshore drilling, stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state. Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast. Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston, calling instead for a study for transportation needs. Ford emphasized the need for <b>more</b> <b>funding</b> for school programs, which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and civics, which he wants reinstated as a school subject. Ford was told about favoritism, intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell. Subsequently, director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford.|$|E
5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get <b>more</b> <b>funding.</b> She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E
