Only a little interest has been generated by researchers for <b>maintenance</b> <b>policies</b> for second-hand products that fail while still under warranty (Shafiee and Chukova 2013). One researcher proposed two periodical age reduction PM models to reduce the high failure rate of the second-hand products (Yeh et al. 2011). For a study that examines the optimal periodic PM policies of a second-hand item following the expiration of warranty, refer to (Kim et al. 2011). Manufacturers should only perform PM actions when the cost savings of warranty servicing exceeds the additional cost incurred by performing PM activities. Thus, more research is required to develop effective PM policies for remanufactured products (Alqahtani and Gupta 2017 a, b).|$|R
40|$|In {{manufacturing}} systems, {{preventive maintenance}} plays {{a fundamental role in}} keeping {{and improving the}} operational condition of machines and the output product quality. However, preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>policies</b> affect the available productive time of the system. This directly influences the lot completion time and delivery dates of customer orders. Therefore the choice of preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>policies</b> needs to be taken by jointly considering the actual condition of machines and the impact of these policies on the service level of the system. This paper proposes an analytical approach for the analysis of the impact of preventive maintenance on the service level of manufacturing systems characterized by degrading machines. The actual degradation state of critical machines is inferred from condition monitoring information gathered by sensor networks. The results obtained from the application of the method to a real industrial case in the aeronautics industry show that the decisions on the optimal <b>maintenance</b> <b>policies</b> depend on both the actual status of machines and the target lot completion time, thus paving the way to new service level oriented <b>maintenance</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
