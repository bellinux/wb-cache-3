40|$|DE 102009013147 A 1 UPAB: 20101014 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} stimulating radiation emission in {{a sample}} over an excitation optical path of a measuring arrangement. Emitted radiations from a focus volume of a measuring optical path of the arrangement are collected within a temporal <b>measuring</b> <b>interval.</b> The focus volume is moved over a surface or volume section of a sample by an optical scanner unit, where the surface or volume section corresponds to multiple of the focus volume. The radiations registered in the moved focus volume over {{the duration of the}} <b>measuring</b> <b>interval</b> are integrated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for executing a method for spectroscopy analysis of a surface or volume section of a sample. USE - Method for spectroscopy analysis e. g. Raman-spectroscopy, fluorescence-spectroscopy, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and infrared-spectroscopy (all claimed), of a surface or volume section of a sample e. g. biological cell and particulate sample, in a measuring arrangement. ADVANTAGE - The method moves the focus volume over the surface or volume section of the sample by the optical scanner unit, and integrates the radiations registered in the moved focus volume over the duration of the <b>measuring</b> <b>interval,</b> thus ensuring simple, fast and precise analysis of the surface or volume section of the sample.

40|$|Summary: The {{relationship}} between the concentration of the analyte and the imprecision of an analytical method can be displayed by the precision profile in which the coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation) is plotted against the concentration of the analyte. The function of {{the curve of the}} profile and its confidence limits can easily be assessed by a computer program developed by W. A. Sadler & M. H. Smith (Clin. Chem. 36 (1990), 1346 — 1350). For the assessment of limits of detection and of quantification the following procedure is proposed: The lower (and upper) limit of the <b>measuring</b> <b>interval</b> is defined by the point at which an acceptable CV-line intersects the confidence limit. If, in the variance function one sets the concentration to zero, the normal distribution of the random errors of the blank will result. The mean of the next adjacent normal distribution, following the variance formula and overlapping the "zero-distribution " by a defined amount, represents the limit of detection. Within the described <b>measuring</b> <b>interval,</b> or within a fraction of it, one might construct overlapping normal distributions in an analogous manner. Their number represents the "power of definition" (PD) (instead of the "analytical sensitivity"), which also depends on the concentration of the determinand according to the variance function. We tested these hypotheses by a comparison of two methods for the determination of cyclosporin...|$|E

40|$|Detailed pulsed neutron {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed in graphite assemblies {{ranging in size from}} 30. 48 cm x 38. 10 cm x 38. 10 cm to 91. 44 cm x 66. 67 cm x 66. 67 cm. Results of the measurement have been compared to a modeled theoretical computation. In the first set of experiments, we measured the effective decay constant of the neutron population in ten graphite stacks as a function of time after the source burst. We found the decay to be non-exponential in the six smallest assemblies, while in three larger assemblies the decay was exponential over {{a significant portion of the}} total <b>measuring</b> <b>interval.</b> The decay in the largest stack was exponential over the entire ten millisecond <b>measuring</b> <b>interval.</b> The non-exponential decay mode occurred when the effective decay constant exceeded 1600 sec^(- 1). In a second set of experiments, we measured the spatial dependence of the neutron population in four graphite stacks as a function of time after the source pulse. By doing an harmonic analysis of the spatial shape of the neutron distribution, we were able to compute the effective decay constants of the first two spatial modes. In addition, we were able to compute the time dependent effective wave number of neutron distribution in the stacks. Finally, we used a Laplace transform technique and a simple modeled scattering kernel to solve a diffusion equation for the time and energy dependence of the neutron distribution in the graphite stacks. Comparison of these theoretical results with the results of the first set of experiments indicated that more exact theoretical analysis would be required to adequately describe the experiments. The implications of our experimental results for the theory of pulsed neutron experiments in polycrystalline media are discussed in the last chapter. ...|$|E
