40|$|Upper Eocene microspherules (microtektites and microkrystites) {{have been}} found in deep-sea sediments from the western North Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, {{equatorial}} Pacific, and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. Recent studies proposed that there are three or four <b>microspherule</b> layers: the North American microtektite and microkrystite couplet in chron C 15, and one (or two) significantly older layer(s) in chron C 16 in DSDP Sites 216, 292 and 612. Based on calcareous nannofossil biochronologic and morphometric data, I suggest that the microspherules in the latter sites correlate with the North American microtektite-microkrystite couplet. My results as well as previously published data are all compatible with the model of one couplet of microtektites-microkrystites. The inference of three or four <b>microspherule</b> layers in the upper Eocene is shown to be an artifact of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{controversy over}} the origin of upper Eocene tektites, microtektites and other microspherules cannot be logically resolved until it is determined just how many events are involved. The microspherule-bearing beds in marine sediments have been dated using standard biozonal techniques. Although a powerful stratigraphic tool, zonal biostratigraph has its limitations. One is that if an event, such as a <b>microspherule</b> occurrence, is observed to occur in a zone at one locality and then a similar event observed in the same zone at another locality, it still may be unwarranted to conclude that these events exactly correlate. To be in a zone a sample only need be between the fossil events that define the zone boundaries. It is often very difficult to accurately determine where within a zone one might be. Further, the zone defining events do not everywhere occur at the same points in time. That is, the ranges of the defining taxa are not always filled. Thus, {{the length of time}} represented by a zone (but not, of course, its chronozone) can vary from place to place. These problems can be offset by use of chronostratigraphic modelling techniques such as Graphic Correlation. This technique was used to build a Cretaceous and Cenozoic model containing fossil, magnetopolarity, and other events. The scale of the model can be demonstrated to be linear with time. This model was used to determine the chronostratigraphic position of upper Eocene <b>microspherule</b> layers...|$|E

Here we report the finding of about 65 <b>microspherules</b> collected in a trench excavated {{in the center of}} the structure. The majority of hand-picked specimens are single, but some of them exhibit compound forms. The single specimens are spherical with a mean size of 137  μm, whereas the more complex samples show peduncles and drop shapes. Dendritic crystal growth is recognized in the internal structure of some broken <b>microspherules.</b> Preliminary chemical composition from the surface and center of <b>microspherules</b> was determined by energy dispersive spectrometry employing EDS. Quantitative EMPA and XRD analysis indicate that the <b>microspherules</b> are mainly composed of Fe and O with magnetite, Fe 0 with subordinate wüstite. Following consideration of possible anthropogenic and volcanic origins, these spherulites are ascribed to an extraterrestrial input. An accumulation rate of 47 <b>microspherules</b> per m 2 /yr is estimated for the studied sediments. This value is two orders of magnitude higher than the reference flux for cosmic dust estimated for the last 1  Ma in the Transantarctic Mountains.

40|$|SummaryRas homolog {{enriched in}} brain (Rheb) is {{critical}} for mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) activation {{in response to}} growth factors and amino acids (AAs). Whereas growth factors inhibit the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC 1 -TSC 2), a negative Rheb regulator, the role of AAs in Rheb activation remains unknown. Here, we identify <b>microspherule</b> protein 1 (MCRS 1) as the essential link between Rheb and mTORC 1 activation. MCRS 1, in an AA-dependent manner, maintains Rheb at lysosome surfaces, connecting Rheb to mTORC 1. MCRS 1 suppression in human cancer cells using small interference RNA or mouse embryonic fibroblasts using an inducible-Cre/Lox system reduces mTORC 1 activity. MCRS 1 depletion promotes Rheb/TSC 2 interaction, rendering Rheb inactive and delocalizing it from lysosomes to recycling endocytic vesicles, leading to mTORC 1 inactivation.

40|$|Magnetic microspherules {{collected}} from the Permian and Triassic bedded cherts in Southwest Japan were studied. The size range, as estimated from 801 microspherules, vary from 3 to 100 μm, with a peak size distribution between 10 - 20 μm. Three broad shapes are recognized : spherical-, drop- and rocket-shaped, all categories including hollow particles. The surface textures as studied from scanning electron microscope show five dominant varieties : random mosaic, dendritic mosaic, feather crystal, scaly and cracked, with intermediate textures between these types. Chemical analyses of representative microspherules by electron microprobe indicate that they are mostly composed of magnetite, resembling in composition with microspherules of cosmic origin from other regions and magnetite grains in carbonaceous chondrites. Consideration {{of the origin of}} the observed morphologic, textural and chemical parameters in these microspherules, along with the available data on experimental synthesis of ultramicro iron particles, preclude an origin by volcanogenic processes and strongly suggest a cosmic origin. Knowledge of the rate of chert sedimentation allows us to make an empirical calculation on the rate of <b>microspherule</b> sedimentation.

40|$|Abstract 58 -kDa <b>microspherule</b> protein (MSP 58) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Currently, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic effect of MSP 58 are not fully understood. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which encodes an essential component for telomerase activity that is involved in cellular immortalization and transformation, is strictly regulated at the gene transcription level. Our previous study revealed a novel function of MSP 58 in cellular senescence. Here we identify telomerase transcriptional element-interacting factor (TEIF) as a novel MSP 58 -interacting protein and determine the effect of MSP 58 on hTERT transcription. This study thus provides evidence showing MSP 58 to be a negative regulator of hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that MSP 58 could suppress the transcription of hTERT promoter. Additionally, stable overexpression of MSP 58 protein in HT 1080 and 293 T cells decreased both endogenous hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Conversely, their upregulation was induced by MSP 58 silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that MSP 58 binds to the hTERT proximal promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of MSP 58 inhibited TEIF-mediated hTERT transactivation, telomerase activation, and cell proliferation promotion. The inhibitory effect of MSP 58 occurred through inhibition of TEIF binding to DNA. Ultimately, the HT 1080 -implanted xenograft mouse model confirmed these cellular effects. Together, our findings provide new insights into both the biological function of MSP 58 and the regulation of telomerase/hTERT expression...|$|E
40|$|Authigenic carbonates {{occur in}} thin layers, nodules, and burrows in {{fine-grained}} siliciclastic sediments of middle Eocene to Quaternary age that were {{recovered from the}} Arctic Ocean and Norwegian-Greenland Sea during Leg 151. At Site 913 (East Greenland Margin), concentrically zoned microspherules and rhombohedrons of ferroan rhodochrosite and manganoan siderite, 20 - 600 µm in diameter, are the main authigenic carbonates in the sedimentary succession. They grew displacively within the host clays and silts, and have locally coalesced to form aggregates. At Sites 909 (Fram Strait) and 911 (Yermak Plateau), very fine to fine-crystalline siderite, enriched in Ca and/or Mg, is the predominant carbonate in the sedimentary succession. It occurs as interparticle cement, disseminated crystals, and rounded intraclasts in host clays, silts, and muds. Minor micritic or radial-fibrous calcite and dolomite were also found at these three sites. Most of these carbonates are interpreted to have precipitated at shallow-burial depths during early diagenesis. All authigenic carbonates (rhodochrosite, siderite, and calcite) from Site 913 are strongly enriched in 1 2 C (δ 13 C =- 22. 9 to- 13. 8 %c) and show decreasing δ 1 3 C values with depth below the seafloor. This evidence, along with authigenic pyrite found in <b>microspherule</b> cores, suggests that dissolved carbon {{was derived from the}} oxidation of marine organic matter in the bacterial sulfate-reduction zone and during the early stages of methanogenesis. However, low organic matter content and headspace methane concentrations suggest additional derivation of dissolved carbon from thermogenic methane.

40|$|The {{presence}} of perovskite (CATiO 3) and hibonite (Ca Al 12 O 19) within {{different regions of}} Calcium-, Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAI) and the trace element concentrations of these minerals in each circumstance, constrain models of precursor formation, nebular condensation, the thermal history of inclusions with relict perovskite and hibonite, {{and the formation of}} the Wark-Lovering rim. At present mineral/melt partition coefficient data for hibonite are limited to a few elements in simple experimental systems, or to those derived from hibonite-glass pairs in hibonite/glass microspherules. Similarly, there is only limited data on perovskite D that are applicable to meteorite compositions. Apart from the importance of partitioning studies to meteorite research, D values also are invaluable in the development of thermodynamic models, especially when data is available for a large number of elements that have different ionic charge and radii. In addition, study of the effect of rapid cooling on partitioning is crucial to our understanding of meteorite inclusions. To expand our knowledge of mineral/melt D for perovskite and hibonite, a study was instituted where D values are obtained in both equilibrium and dynamic cooling experiments. As an initial phase of this study mineral/melt D was measured for major elements (Ca, Mg, Al, Ti, and Si), 15 rare earth elements (La-Lu) and 8 other elements (Ba, Sr, U, Th, Nb, Zr, Hf, and Ge) in perovskite and hibonite grown under equilibrium conditions, in bulk compositions that are respectively similar to Compact Type A (CTA) CAI and to a hibonite/glass <b>microspherule.</b> Experimental mixes were doped with REE at 20 - 50 x chondritic (ch) abundances, Ba at 50 ppm, Sr, Hf, Nb, and Zr at 100 ppm and, U and Th at 200 ppm. Trace element abundances were measured with the PANURGE ion microprobe. Major element compositions were obtained by electron microprobe analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 28 elements were measured using an ion microprobe in perovskite, hibonite and coexisting melts, in isothermal crystallization experiments on chemical compositions {{similar to those}} of Compact Type A (CTA) Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAI) and to a hibonite-glass <b>microspherule.</b> The mineral/melt partition coefficients (D) calculated from the measured concentrations for both minerals define reliable D-values. Perovskite and hibonite D's have ranges of 10 ^− 2 for Si to 20 for Th and 3 · 10 ^− 3 for Si to ∼ 8 for La, respectively. There are regular relationships between the ionic radius, the valence of the trace element and the partition coefficients in perovskite and hibonite. While there are differences in the D-values between perovskite and hibonite, they follow very similar trends with perovskite typically having D-values that are 5 – 10 times higher for the same element. Perovskite and hibonite D's are almost identical for the divalent cations Ba (0. 02 and 0. 03, respectively) and Sr (1. 1 and 0. 8, respectively) in our experiments. D_Mg for perovskite is low, 0. 03, when compared with the value for hibonite, 0. 5. Mineral/melt D's for the REE decrease continuously from D_La = 6 to D_Lu = 0. 03 in hibonite. For perovskite, REE D's increase slightly from D_La = 10 to D_Nd = 15 and then decrease continuously to D_Lu = 1. 0 and D's for trivalent cations with smaller ionic radii than the REE are lower, with D_Al = 0. 08 and D_Sc = 0. 15 lower than D_Cr = 0. 8 and D_V = 1. 0. With the exception of D_Th and D_Si in perovskite and DSi in hibonite, the D-values for tetravalent cations and Nb, the only pentavalent element, fall within the range of D's for the REE. D_th/D_U equals 3 in perovskite and ∼ 15 in hibonite. Our data {{can be applied to the}} genesis and evolution of hibonite in refractory meteorite inclusions. For example, low Ba relative to other refractory elements, such as Hf, Zr, La, etc., in hibonite has been observed in some hibonite-bearing inclusions. Since D_Ba ⪡ D_Hf, ⪡ D_Zr and ⪡ D_La in our experiments low Ba may result from the incompatibility of Ba in hibonite rather than the increased volatility of Ba under oxidizing conditions during condensation. In addition, since D_La/D_Lu > 50 for hibonite. LREE/HREE ratios of 1 in hibonite in some CTA CAI from Leoville and Allende are inconsistent with hibonite equilibrating with the melts that formed these inclusions and the hibonite is relict. Similar applications are possible with our perovskite partitioning data. For example, it is likely that high-REE (500 − 1000 × chondritic) perovskite with Th/U of 3 – 4 that are found in the outer region of Type B 1 CAI have not been in equilibrium with the CAI melt that contains ∼ 20 × ch REE and a Th/U ratio of 3 and they are probably relics that survived the most recent partial melting event...|$|E

Many sites in the Northern Hemisphere preserve a sedimentary record across the onset of the YD interval, including sites investigated in sedimentary basins located in central Mexico (Chapala, Cuitzeo, Acambay), the Basin of Mexico (Tocuila), and northern Mexico (El Cedral). Deposits consist of lacustrine or marginal lake sediments that were deposited during the Pleistocene and the Holocene. At the Tocuila and Acambay sites, Pleistocene fossil vertebrate assemblages, mainly mammoths (Mammuthus columbi), are found in association with a distinctive organic layer, sometimes called the black mat that formed during the YD.

The structural analysis has been connected with a textural study by a multifractal analysis, that is able to distinguish terrestrial biogenic stromatolites from abiogenic pseudo-stromatolites, and giving us a tool that might be applied for astrobiological purposes...|$|R
50|$|Bolide impacts can be {{dramatic}} triggers of mass extinctions. An asteroid {{impact was}} posited {{as the prime}} cause of this faunal turnover, but no secure evidence of a specific extraterrestrial impact has been identified in this case. Impact craters, such as the Kellwasser-aged Alamo and the Hangenberg-aged Woodleigh, cannot generally be dated with sufficient precision to link them to the event; others dated precisely are not contemporaneous with the extinction. Although some minor features of meteoric impact have been observed in places (iridium anomalies and <b>microspherules),</b> these were probably caused by other factors.|$|R
50|$|The {{evidence}} claimed for {{an impact}} event includes charred carbon-rich layers of soil {{that have been}} found at some 50 Clovis sites across the continent. The proponents report that layers contain unusual materials (nanodiamonds, metallic <b>microspherules,</b> carbon spherules, magnetic spherules, iridium, platinum, charcoal, soot and fullerenes enriched in helium-3) that they interpret as evidence of an impact event, at the very bottom of black mats of organic material that they say marks the beginning of the Younger Dryas, and is claimed cannot be explained by volcanic, anthropogenic, and other natural processes.|$|R
5000|$|Micrometeorites are {{typically}} metallic <b>microspherules</b> (iron or iron and nickel) {{but can also}} be formed by silicate minerals, whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial meteoroids, resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the Earth’s atmosphere. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine {{that only a few}} minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.|$|R
40|$|Evidence from South China and Western Australia for a 365 -Ma impact {{event in}} the Lower crepida conodont zone of the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian (about 1. 5 Ma after the Frasnian/Famennian {{extinction}} event) includes microtektitelike glassy <b>microspherules,</b> geochemical anomalies (including a weak Ir), a probable impact crater (greater than 70 k) at Taihu in South China, and an Ir anomaly in Western Australia. A brachiopod faunal turnover in South China, and the 'strangelove ocean'-like c-delta 13 excursions in both Chinese and Australian sections indicate that at least a regional-scale extinction might have occurred {{at the time of}} the impact. A paleoreconstruction shows that South China was very close to and facing Western Australia in the Late Devonian. The carbon isotopic excursions, which occur at the same stratigraphic level in both South China and Western Australia cannot be explained as being coincidental. The c-delta 13 excursions and the brachiopod faunal turnover in South China indicate that there might have been at least a regional (possibly global) extinction in the Lower crepida zone. The impact-derived <b>microspherules</b> and geochemical anomalies (especially the Ir) indicate a Lower crepida zone impact event on eastern Gondwana. The location, type of target rocks, and possibly age of the Taihu Lake crater qualify as the probable site of this Late Devonian impact...|$|R
