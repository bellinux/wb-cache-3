5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> skilled enough {{to promote the}} export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the areas}} {{affected}} are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing; however {{it can also}} occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> slightly affected if at all. People with extreme cases will also have reactions to light bulbs that emit a UV wavelength (any bulb {{that is not an}} LED). Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak.|$|E

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{effectively}} pollinated {{by a single}} bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of succession <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E

5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E
5|$|Falklands '82 is a turn-based {{strategy}} game {{focusing on}} land battles during the Falklands War. The player commands the British Task Force against the Argentine ground forces, who are occupying the islands. The game begins by allocating fifteen Royal Navy ships {{for the task}} force; a proportionate amount must be devoted for attack and defence purposes. The player must then choose four landing spots in northern East Falkland to begin the invasion: Port Stanley, Berkeley Sound, Cow Bay and San Carlos Bay. The SAS or SBS are available throughout the game to provide intelligence on Argentine movements; however, intelligence is limited and <b>may</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> collected {{a certain number of}} times. At any time, the player may request reinforcements from either one of the two aircraft carriers, HMS Hermes or HMS Invincible.|$|E
