5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by <b>medication,</b> particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of <b>medication</b> leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the <b>medication</b> benznidazole or nifurtimox. <b>Medication</b> nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, <b>medication</b> may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the <b>medication</b> {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then.

50|$|Trials of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti-obesity <b>medications</b> {{suggest that}} these <b>medications</b> are {{superior}} to placebo in reducing binge eating. <b>Medications</b> are not considered the treatment of choice because psychotherapeutic approaches, such as CBT, are more effective than <b>medications</b> for binge eating disorder. <b>Medications</b> also do not increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy, though some patients may benefit from anticonvulsant and anti-obesity <b>medications,</b> such as Phentermine/topiramate, for weight loss.|$|R
50|$|<b>Medications</b> can be {{very helpful}} {{in the long term}} {{treatment}} of polysubstance dependence. <b>Medications</b> are a useful aid in helping to prevent or reducing drug cravings. Another benefit of <b>Medications</b> is helping to preventing relapse. Since drug addictions effect brain functioning, <b>medications</b> assist in returning to normal brain functioning. Polysubstance abusers require <b>medications</b> for each substance they are addicted to, as the current <b>medications</b> do not treat all addictions simultaneously. <b>Medications</b> are a useful aid in treatments, but are not effective when they are the sole treatment method.|$|R
5|$|Actor Michael J. Fox has PD and {{has greatly}} {{increased}} the {{public awareness of}} the disease. After diagnosis, Fox embraced his Parkinson's in television roles, sometimes acting without <b>medication,</b> in order to further illustrate the effects of the condition. He has written two autobiographies in which his fight against the disease plays a major role, and appeared before the United States Congress without <b>medication</b> to illustrate the effects of the disease. The Michael J. Fox Foundation aims to develop a cure for Parkinson's disease. Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institutet for his contributions to research in Parkinson's disease.|$|E

Recently, many treatments have evolved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or sexual health. Of the available treatments several are pharmacologically proven and tested <b>medications.</b> However, in Asia, there are significant users of unproven <b>medications</b> for sexual health. These <b>medications</b> are traditionally used by the folklore living in the countryside.

50|$|In general, any {{patient who}} has {{frequent}} headaches or migraine attacks {{should be considered}} as a potential candidate for preventive <b>medications</b> instead of being encouraged to take more and more painkillers or other rebound-causing <b>medications.</b> Preventive <b>medications</b> are taken on a daily basis. Some patients may require preventive <b>medications</b> for many years; others may require them for only {{a relatively short period of}} time such as six months. Effective preventive <b>medications</b> have been found to come from many classes of <b>medications</b> including neuronal stabilizing agents (aka anticonvulsants), antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antihistamines. Some effective preventive <b>medications</b> include Elavil (amitriptyline), Depakote (valproate), Topamax (topiramate), and Inderal (propranolol).|$|R

5|$|Epilepsy {{is usually}} treated with daily <b>medication</b> once a second seizure has occurred, while {{in those at}} high risk, <b>medication</b> may be started after the first seizure.

In drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with <b>medication</b> in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to <b>medication,</b> then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E

40|$|Today, <b>medications</b> {{are central}} to both formal and {{familial}} healthcare systems. This article examines <b>medications</b> as ingrained and socio-culturally significant features of domestic landscapes.

5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the <b>medication.</b> Sudden withdrawals from <b>medication</b> or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the issue of}} {{evaluating}} potential risk posed by <b>medications</b> to the fetus during pregnancy. For this purpose various countries use classifications of <b>medications</b> broken down into risk categories during pregnancy. The most popular classification is US FDA classification, which identifies five categories of <b>medications</b> (А, В, С, D and Х) depending on the degree of their embryotoxic and teratogenic side effect, which enables physicians to make informed choices in selecting pharmacotherapy during the entire gestational period. The article discusses possible specific fetal and neonatal disorders when administering <b>medications</b> in categories X and D. <b>Medications</b> in category D may be prescribed to pregnant women only in extreme situations. Administering <b>medications</b> in category X is absolutely inadvisable before and during pregnancy. Further research in this area makes it possible to improve the classification of <b>medications</b> by degree of their embryotoxic and teratogenic risk and address the issue of selecting safe <b>medications</b> during pregnancy.

5000|$|Breastfeeding and <b>medications</b> is the {{description}} of the <b>medications</b> that can be used by a breastfeeding mother with no or few consequences and those <b>medications</b> which are recommended to be avoided. Some <b>medications</b> are excreted in breastmilk. Almost all medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts. Some have no effect on the baby and can be used while breastfeeding. The National Institutes of Medicine (US) maintains a database containing information on drugs and other chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. It includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood, and the possible adverse effects in the nursing infant. Suggested therapeutic alternatives to those drugs are provided, where appropriate. All data are derived from reliable sources. Some <b>medications</b> and herbal supplements can be of concern. This can be because the drug can accumulate in breastmilk or have effects on the infant and the mother. Those <b>medications</b> of concern are those <b>medications</b> used to treat substance and alcohol addiction. Other <b>medications</b> of concern are those that are used in smoking cessation.
