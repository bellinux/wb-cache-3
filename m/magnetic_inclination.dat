2500|$|The {{magnetic}} compass is very reliable at moderate latitudes, but in geographic regions near the Earth's magnetic poles it becomes unusable. [...] As the compass is {{moved closer to}} one of the magnetic poles, the magnetic declination, the difference between the direction to geographical north and magnetic north, becomes greater and greater. At some point close to the magnetic pole the compass will not indicate any particular direction but will begin to drift. Also, the needle starts to point up or down when getting closer to the poles, because of the so-called <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclination.</b> Cheap compasses with bad bearings may get stuck because of this and therefore indicate a wrong direction.|$|E

30|$|We {{conducted}} onshore {{and offshore}} magnetic surveys on {{and around the}} southern Boso Peninsula, Honshu, Japan, and observed prominent large amplitude anomalies along the Mineoka Ophiolite Belt, and long wavelength low anomalies {{to the south of}} the belt containing short wavelength isolated anomalies. The magnetic structure was modeled by using three-dimensional magnetic prisms and basement with about 1 A/m of magnetization. At the Mineoka Belt, the top of the magnetic prisms is located at the ground surface, and these bodies are elongate in the vertical direction, with high angle <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> basement exists at shallow depth beneath the belt. The magnetic basement traces the bottom surfaces of the magnetic prisms and forms a graben structure. In the south of the Mineoka Belt, thin sheet-like magnetic prisms with low <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> are assumed at 1 – 3 km depth. The magnetic structure implies the tectonic process of the formation of the Mineoka Ophiolite Belt. The belt could be fragmented pieces of an oceanic plate emplaced at a paleo-plate boundary, which originated in low latitude and was transported by obduction to the present place via northward drift.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{compositions}} of basalts, detailed lithologic data, {{and stable}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> {{are used to}} define an eruptive stratigraphy for the basement sections at Holes 417 D and 418 A. A maximum of 25 eruptive units, comprising three major sequences, are recognized in the 365 -meter-thick section at Hole 417 D, and a maximum of 54 eruptive units grouped into seven eruptive cycles are defined in the 544 meters pene-trated at Hole 418 A. The rocks in Hole 417 A are too altered to permit detailed stratigraphic analysis. The freshness of the rocks at Holes 417 D and 418 A suggests that the basement was sealed off shortly after formation by sedimentation and growth of secondary phases in the lava pile. Several horizons marked {{by the presence of}} breccia, by changes in <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> and chemical compositions, and by increased alteration are believed to reflect major quiescent intervals in the eruptive record. These define a pattern of episodic eruption, with each episode possibly derived from a separate magma reservoir system. Variations in downhole <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> suggest that crustal deformation occurs during each eruptive cycle, and that oscillatory lateral migration of the active zone may occur before a crustal section is complete. Chemical variation of the basalts is not extensive and is dominated by fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and spinel. Pheno-cryst movement during eruption and flow is fairly complex, but accumu-lation of plagioclase at or near the site of initial crystallization is a widespread phenomenon. Most magmas had reached a low-pressure cotectic stage by the time of eruption, but relict clinopyroxenes indicate an earlier stage of fractionation. Dikes were intersected in the lower part of Hole 418 A and correspond chemically to flows 130 meters higher in the section. These may repre-sent the top of an underlying dike complex, originally forming near-surface feeder conduits, but now buried by subsequent eruptions...|$|R

Hole 745 B on {{the southern}} Kerguelen Plateau gave the excellent reversal sequence during the last 6 Ma including the Cobb Mt. event in the Matuyama chron and the unidentified subchron in the Gilbert chron. Limestone sequence at Hole 738 C from Turonian to Santonian stage shows the low paleolatitude (54 °S) compared with the present (64 °S).

In Hole 742 C of Prydz Bay, glacial sequence down to 316 mbsf (meter below sea floor) was drilled.

40|$|Abstract – Palaeomagnetic data in {{combination}} with palaeostress data and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility orientations are utilized to develop a tectonic evolutionary model for the Early Tertiary part of the (omega) -shaped Çankırı Basin (Turkey). The results reveal clockwise rotations {{in the northeast and}} anticlockwise rotations in the west and southeastern corner of the basin. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> indicate a northward drift of the Çankırı Basin and support an indentation model for the Kırşehir Block. It is proposed that the -shape of the Çankırı Basin was the result of indentation of the Kırşehir Block into the Sakarya Continent during northwards migration accompanying closure of Neotethys. It appears that the indentation started prior to Eocene and ended before Middle Miocene times...|$|R
30|$|The neutral wind is {{typically}} considered {{the primary source}} of EIA interhemispheric asymmetry, whereas the zonal electric field is secondary. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> at the bottom F-layer altitude are 25.413 ° and − 19.073 ° at Chiang Mai and Kototabang, respectively. The thermospheric meridional wind is linked with the parallel upward motion along the geomagnetic field lines. The vertical component of the parallel upward velocity of plasma can be derived from the change of the F-layer bottom height. Because zonal electric fields also affect the upward drift of plasma, the effect from zonal electric fields is removed in order to use the F-layer bottom height for the transequatorial meridional wind estimation. The application to link meridional wind with an actual F-layer bottom height is limited to nighttime (Maruyama et al. 2008).|$|R

50|$|Rock {{magnetic}} {{data obtained}} {{suggest that the}} lava flows from Site 1205 carry a remnant magnetization suitable for scientific analysis. Although some of the rocks needed a more complex and thorough analysis, most samples yielded data suitable to make a preliminary determination of <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations.</b> Twenty-two independent <b>magnetic</b> group were identified, yielding a mean inclination of -45.7° (+10.5°/-6.3°). The mean inclination suggests a latitude of formation on an early Eocene Nintoku Seamount at 27.1° (+5.5°/-7.7°). This value, together with paleo-latitudes from analyses of rocks at Site 433 (1980), Site 884 (1997), and Sites 1203 and 1204 (Leg 197; Detroit Seamount), form a consistent data set indicating southward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot from Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary time, a hunch that many scientists had harbored for a long time.|$|R
40|$|Context. The cut-off {{frequency}} of magnetoacoustic gravity (MAG) waves could be decreased by the inclined magnetic field, and therefore, low-frequency waves could penetrate {{into the upper}} atmosphere. Aims. We observe {{the distribution of the}} {{cut-off frequency}} of compressive waves at various heights and reconstruct the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>inclination,</b> according to the MAG wave theory in a stratified atmosphere permeated by a uniform magnetic field. Methods. We analysed the emission intensity oscillations of sunspot AR 11131 (08 Dec. 2010) observed at the 1700 Å, 1600 Å, and 304 Å bandpasses of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and computed the narrow-band power maps with the pixelised wavelet filtering method. The distribution of the cut-off frequency was defined as the median contour in the azimuthally-averaged oscillation power. The <b>magnetic</b> field <b>inclination</b> was estimated with the local cut-off frequency according to the MAG wave theory in the low-β limit and was compared to the potential field extrapolation. Results. Shorter period oscillations dominate in the sunspot umbra, while longer period oscillations form an annular shape approximately concentric with the sunspot. Oscillations with longer periods are distributed further away from the sunspot centre. The 5 min oscillations appear to originate at or lower than the photosphere.

40|$|We report <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclinations</b> {{measured}} in deep-sea sediments of the equatorial Indian Ocean which record {{the behavior of}} a nondipole component of the timeaveraged geomagnetic field during the Plio-Pleistocene (0 - 5 Ma). The magnitude of the nondipole effect recorded in these sediments appears to depend on polarity state, with inclinations showing departures from geocentric axial dipole directions which are small (2 °) during normal polarity and larger (5 °) during reverse polarity times. The overall nondipole effect observed here is consistent with prior spherical harmonic estimates of the paleomagnetic field; the polarity bias found agrees, in both sense and magnitude, with earlier reports of polarity asymmetry in the low-degree zonal harmonic fields. The presence of this asymmetry supports previous suggestions of the existence of a standing component of the nondipole field which does not invert during reversals of the main field. We explore whether the standing field so indicated may have influenced paleomagnetic directions recorded during polarity transitions at other equatorial sites...|$|R
40|$|Results of paleo{{magnetic}} {{and rock}} magnetic measurements are presented from gabbroic samples recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 147 at the Hess Deep. Paleomagnetic measurements indicate that samples acquired {{up to two}} small com-ponents of secondary remanent magnetization.

The mean intensity of natural remanent magnetization for the recovered gabbros is 2. 3 A/m, and the Koenigsberger ratio indicates that the in situ magnetiza-tion is dominated by remanent, rather than induced, magnetization. Measurements of hysteresis loop parameters indicate that the effective magnetic grain size of the gabbro samples falls within the pseudo-single domain region.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1590s Henry Briggs, a {{professor}} of geometry at Gresham College in London, had published a table of <b>magnetic</b> <b>inclination</b> with latitude for the earth. It agreed well with the inclinations that Gilbert measured around the circumference of his terella. Gilbert deduced that the Earth's magnetic field is equivalent {{to that of a}} uniformly magnetized sphere, magnetized parallel to the axis of rotation (in modern terms, a geocentric axial dipole). However, he was aware that declinations were not consistent with this model. Based on the declinations that were known at the time, he proposed that the continents, because of their raised topography, formed centers of attraction that made compass needles deviate. He even demonstrated this effect by gouging out some topography on his terella and measuring the effect on declinations. A Jesuit monk, Niccolò Cabeo, later took a leaf from Gilbert's book and showed that, if the topography was on the correct scale for the Earth, the differences between the highs and lows would only be about one tenth of a millimeter. Therefore, the continents could not noticeably affect the declination.|$|E

Wind passed through the near magnetotail at distances of - 15 RE&lt;X GSM&lt;- 6 RE on 35 occasions. Another 10 passes took place at distances of - 30 RE&lt;X GSM&lt;- 15 RE. We identified 65 dipolarization events in the Wind magnetic field data set between Y GSM~- 16 and + 16 RE based upon our requirements that the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>inclination</b> had to change by more than 15 &deg;, the maximum inclination angle had to be greater than 20 &deg;, and the inclination angle had to increase {{by a factor of}} at least 1. 5. Most of the dipolarization events occurred in the pre-midnight region of the magnetotail and were accompanied by earthward flows with speeds greater than 100 km/s. The properties of the dipolarization events did not depend upon the Y GSM position. However, they did vary with the distance to the neutral sheet. Isolated dipolarization events, defined as occurring more than 20 min apart, were characterized by a decrease in Bx GSM and BTOTAL, and an increase in Bz GSM and the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>inclination.</b> Dipolarizations that occurred as part of a series of small dipolarizations spaced less than 20 min apart were characterized by a transient increase in Bz GSM and the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>inclination,</b> but no significant change in Bx GSM and BTOTAL.
