50|$|In 1954 Jack Bush {{started a}} {{filtration}} company that would grow from {{a handful of}} employees to a multinational Life Science corporation with 6,000 employees and annual sales of $1.53 billion by 2007. This new company pioneered the use of membrane technology in hundreds of applications. Through strategic acquisitions, substantial R&D investments, and international expansion, Millipore broadened its technology and market base to become a leader in the Life Science industry. In the early 1950s Lovell Corporation won a contract from the U.S. Army Chemical Engineers to develop and manufacture membrane filtering devices and systems used to separate the molecular components of fluid samples. When the membranes were declassified in 1953 and offered for commercial use, Jack Bush, a Lovell employee, bought the company’s right to the technology for $200,000 and established the <b>Millipore</b> <b>Filter</b> Company which later changed its name to Millipore Corporation to reflect its growing range of products.|$|E
5000|$|Nirenberg and Leder {{could not}} decode the {{remaining}} codons {{in the same}} manner as Nirenberg did with Matthaei. Because the mRNA bases were taken up at random by the ribosome, it is hard to determine which specific codon correlates with the amino acid. For example, to pick out the correct codon among non-repeating codons (UCU, CUU, UUC) was difficult because they couldn't determine the specific sequence. Instead, Leder and Nirenberg used very short artificial RNA sequences (three nucleotides) in the cell-free systems. These shorter length fragments were long enough to allow the ribosome to bind with the type of tRNA molecule that is complementary to the one codon and still be detectable. The key step of the experiment was that they labeled one type of amino acid at a time and then put the mixture through a <b>Millipore</b> <b>filter</b> (a type of nucleopore filter). This special filter allowed unbound tRNAs to pass through but did not allow the ribosomes with the bound triplet to pass through. The sample was then tested for radioactivity. If there was radioactivity found in the sample that did not pass through the filter, the corresponding amino acid had been added.|$|E

Ex-periments {{were performed}} {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} noncollagenous proteins extracted from dentin on cultured enamel organs and dental papillae. Seven noncollagenous protein fractions were prepared from rabbit incisor dentin and used as substrates to coat <b>Millipore</b> <b>filters.</b> Embryonic mouse tooth germs were dissociated and the isolated tissues were cultured for 4 days on these different substrates as well as on noncoated <b>Millipore</b> <b>filters.</b> When compared to control cultures, only two protein fractions affected the behaviour of epithelial cells. A slight elongation of the cell body and a preferential localization of the nuclei at the basal pole of the cells in contact with the filter was observed with protein fractions 5 and 6. When dental papillae were cultured on <b>Millipore</b> <b>filters</b> coated either with protein fraction 2 or fraction 6, the mesenchymal cells in contact with the filter elongated, polarized and demon-strated a high metabolic activity.

Leucocytes which have been incubated with tritiated thymidine are trapped on a <b>Millipore</b> <b>filter</b> which is then suitably washed and dried. The filter is then immersed in scintillation fluid in a double-vial apparatus designed to ensure a reproducible counting geometry. Alternatively, the filter and its radioactive contents can be combusted to tritiated water, the radioactivity of which is then determined in a homogeneous counting system.

40|$|The human {{monocyte}} is {{an important}} member of the host defence system, but has been little studied in vitro. In this report, I describe a reproducible and simple method for monocyte chemotaxis in man, using a Boyden chamber. Monocyte suspension was prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation. The purity of the suspension was checked with Peroxidase-Giemsa staining. Chemotaxis assay was performed using a 5 μm pore sized Millipore filter(thickness: 150 μm) and a Nuclepore filter (thickness: 13 μm). When the <b>Millipore</b> <b>filter</b> was used, migrated cells stayed in the filter, while it appeared that cells detached from the filter when the Nuclepore filter was used. In the modified Boyden method using a <b>Millipore</b> <b>filter,</b> more than 3 × 10 (5) monocytes had {{to be added to}} the upper room of the chamber, and the duration of 90 minutes was adequate for incubation.

He expanded {{the business to}} include North Star Orchids, an orchid nursery that was a major importer of orchids in 1975 and 1976. During that time, he designed and established a commercial plant tissue culture laboratory for North Star Orchids; the lab {{was one of the}} first commercial plant tissue culture labs to use a laminar flow hood based on <b>millipore</b> <b>filters</b> for aseptic lab work, at a time when glove boxes were the standard aseptic tissue culture work areas. Davis invented a new type of plant tissue culture vessel based on <b>millipore</b> <b>filters</b> for respiration, and that invention was published in Orchid Review, where it received international attention. It was cited in subsequent scientific papers and eventually became part of the standard design of almost all types of labware that needed to provide aseptic respiration.|$|R

After rinsing the filter with 10  ml water for injections, the bubble point is determined with a requirement of a minimum of 3, 450  mbar/ 50  psi according to the Merck Millipore requirements. In more detail, a closed system is constructed with a sterile 50  ml Luer-lock syringe connected to the Merck <b>Millipore</b> <b>filter</b> tester, which is again connected to the filter unit.

They anastomosed {{with each other}} and formed a network: similar to that seen in normal human skin. Only incomplete capillary growth was noted around the lung transplant. New capillary growth was prominent at the vascular membrane side around buccal membrane.

Relative diffusion coefficients were calculated for each layer. Layers of 8 % polyacrylamide, and of caecal, mid-colonic and terminal colonic mucus, had coefficients that were 50 - 60 % of the apparent free diffusion coefficient for butyrate, determined using layers made up of <b>Millipore</b> <b>filters</b> alone. The apparent free diffusion coefficients for butyrate (layers of agarose or filters) were 70 % of previously determined values in the literature.

All mucus layers differed significantly from layers of 2 % agarose and <b>Millipore</b> <b>filters</b> but were not significantly different from layers of 8 % polyacrylamide or from each other. Diffusion coefficients for butyrate in the mucus samples correlated with water content and carbohydrate content but had no relationship to protein content. The rate of diffusion of butyrate in colonic mucus layers was significantly reduced when compared with unstirred layers (P < 0. 05).
