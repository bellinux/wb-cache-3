5|$|Both the McCain and Obama campaigns {{released}} light-hearted {{statements about}} the prank.

5|$|Huntsman {{was one of}} John McCain's {{earliest}} {{supporters in}} his 2008 presidential campaign, while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney. Huntsman helped <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007. At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates for {{the nomination}} and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination. McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, McCain {{announced}} that he would resume his campaign, and he went ahead with the debate. Some commentators questioned whether the campaign had ever in fact been suspended, as McCain ads continued to play, McCain spokesmen continued giving statements criticizing Obama, and <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> offices remained open, while McCain himself continued to make speeches and give interviews.|$|E
25|$|<b>McCain</b> <b>campaigned</b> against Proposition 200, a 2004 Arizona state {{initiative}} {{intended to}} prevent illegal immigrants from voting, receiving welfare benefits, and mandated state agencies to report illegals to the federal government. McCain argued Prop 200 would be overly expensive to execute, {{that it would be}} ineffectual, and that immigration regulation falls only under the purview of the federal government.|$|R

5000|$|On August 10, 2008, the New York Times {{described}} <b>McCains</b> <b>campaign</b> as [...] "divided" [...] in {{the wake}} of a disagreement with Hazelbaker over her criticism of Barack Obamas overseas trip in July. Hazelbaker denounced Obamas trip as a [...] "campaign rally overseas," [...] but McCain corrected her remarks, saying that he was glad Obama had visited Iraq and Afghanistan, and saw political overtones only in his visits to other countries.|$|R
25|$|The Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Obama {{campaign}} {{have charged}} that, in a videotaped interview in 2007, McCain reiterated {{his support for}} transporting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain but {{said he would not}} be comfortable with such transports going through Phoenix, Arizona. The <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> responded by attacking Obama's record on energy issues.|$|E
25|$|Virginia {{election}} {{authorities were}} ordered {{by a federal}} judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign.</b> It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, a judge {{rejected}} motions made by {{the legal}} team for McCain and the Republican National Committee to dismiss the Browne lawsuit which charged possible copyright infringement, false endorsement and violation of Browne's right of publicity. The case was {{settled out of court}} for an undisclosed sum in July 2009, with the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign,</b> the Ohio Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee issuing a joint apology for using the song. Their statement declared that McCain himself had been unaware of the use and did not condone it.|$|E

25|$|After announcing Palin as the {{presumptive}} vice-presidential nominee, the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> received $7million {{in contributions}} {{in a single}} day, and the Obama campaign garnered more than $8million by the next day. During the campaign, Palin evoked a more strongly divided response than Joe Biden among voters and was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably when compared to her opponent. A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate. Following the presidential election, 69% of Republicans felt Palin had helped John McCain's bid, while 20% felt Palin hurt. In the same poll, 71% of Republicans stated Palin had been the right choice.|$|E
25|$|February 9 saw {{voting in}} Louisiana, Kansas and Washington state. Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, {{claiming}} all 36 of the state's {{delegates to the}} national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> expressed no concern over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator. Louisiana was much closer, but Huckabee won there as well, beating McCain by less than one percentage point. McCain was declared {{the winner of the}} Washington caucuses, where 18 delegates were at stake. The February 19 primary would determine the other 19 delegates from the state. After the caucuses, Huckabee's campaign indicated that they would challenge the results.|$|E

This introduction occurred after the <b>McCain</b> <b>campaign</b> began emphasizing the Obama–Ayers controversy.

5000|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, however, [...] "When <b>McCains</b> <b>campaign</b> plane {{landed in}} Michigan that day, however, the {{candidate}} talked to reporters to clarify his original remarks.

500|$|When Obama {{became the}} Democrats' {{presumptive}} nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall.
