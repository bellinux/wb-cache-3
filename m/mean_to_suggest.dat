40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to type theory in which the typing judgments do not have explicit contexts. Instead of judgments of shape "Gamma |- A : B", our systems just have judgments of shape "A : B". A key feature is that we distinguish free and bound variables even in pseudo-terms.

We prove that the typing judgments of these systems correspond in a natural way with those of Pure Type Systems as traditionally formulated. I. e., our systems have exactly the same well-typed terms as traditional presentations of type theory.

6000|$|Under these circumstances, {{only the}} extreme {{need of a}} despairing [...] "reconciler" [...] {{drowning}} {{in a sea of}} adverse facts, can explain the catching at such a poor straw as the reckless guess that the swineherds of the [...] "country of the Gadarenes" [...] were erring Jews, doing a little clandestine business on their own account. The endeavour to justify the asserted destruction of the swine by the analogy of breaking open a cask of {556} smuggled spirits, and wasting their contents on the ground, is curiously unfortunate. Does Mr. Gladstone <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that a Frenchman landing at Dover, and coming upon a cask of smuggled brandy {{in the course of a}} stroll along the cliffs, has the right to break it open and waste its contents on the ground? Yet the party of Galileans who, according to the narrative, landed and took a walk on the Gadarene territory, were as much foreigners in the Decapolis as Frenchmen would be at Dover. Herod Antipas, their sovereign, had no jurisdiction in the Decapolis--they were strangers and aliens, with no more right to interfere with a pig-keeping Hebrew than I have a right to interfere with an English professor of the Israelitic faith, if I see a slice of ham on his plate. According to the law of the country in which these Galilean foreigners found themselves, men might keep pigs if they pleased. If the men who kept them were Jews, it might be permissible for the strangers to inform the religious authority acknowledged by the Jews of Gadara, but to interfere themselves in such a matter was a step devoid of either moral or legal justification.|$|E

60|$|Independently of this, I {{have always}} thought that {{to sit in the}} British Parliament should be the highest object of {{ambition}} to every educated Englishman. I do not by this <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that every educated Englishman should set before himself a seat in Parliament as a probable or even a possible career; but that the man in Parliament has reached a higher position than the man out,--that to serve one's country without pay is the grandest work that a man can do,--that of all studies the study of politics is the one in which a man may make himself most useful to his fellow-creatures,--and that of all lives, public political lives are capable of the highest efforts. So thinking,--though I was aware that fifty-three was too late an age at which to commence a new career,--I resolved with much hesitation that I would make the attempt. Writing now at an age beyond sixty, I can say that my political feelings and convictions have never undergone any change. They are now what they became when I first began to have political feelings and convictions. Nor do I find in myself any tendency to modify them as I have found generally in men as they grow old. I consider myself to be an advanced, but still a Conservative-Liberal, which I regard not only as a possible, but as a rational and consistent phase of political existence. I can, I believe, in a very few words, make known my political theory; and, as I am anxious that any who know aught of me should know that, I will endeavour to do so.|$|E
40|$|Media {{has always}} been a {{significant}} platform to raise socio-political issues. Elections are won or lost, personalities and stars are created or marred, business houses are raised or razed— courtesy media. Media holds the power of discourse. Discourse, according to Foucault, refers to: ways of constituting knowledge, together with the social practices, forms of subjectivity and power relations which abide in such knowledges and relations between them. Discourses are more than ways of thinking and producing meaning. Discourse aids in focusing on power relationships in society as expressed through language and practices. Media plays a vital role in expressing these power relations and makes use of language as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the power equation prevalent in society between various factions. Media has over the years been instrumental in subverting the gender bias. Some of the films have treated the issue of emancipation of women on a very serious scale and the contribution of men towards this highly sensitive issue makes these films all the more commendable. One such movie is the National Award winning bilingual movie “Astitva”, which shall be analyzed in detail in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{any kind}} of artistic representation, motion capture is {{faithful}} to nature. Therefore, the trajectories obtained from human movement using 3 D motion capture technology shows {{the beauty of the}} nature of our movement, which has never been revealed before with scientifically proven accuracy. For faithfully conveying the beauty of complex and multi-segmental human motion, this paper tries to initiate the exploratory Pattern-Finding of the movement in order to unveil more hidden beauties and art from our nature. Historically, depictions of human movement have had the particular challenge of representing time-based events in a single image. Pre-photography, movement was represented by capturing a stop-action visual effect (e. g. Diskobolos of Myron). When used as <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the essence of motion, effects need not be accurate anthropokinetically.

6000|$|Oh, no, I {{shall never}} pay any duties on pirated books of mine. I am much too respectable for that--yet awhile. But here--one thing that grovels me is this: {{as far as}} I can discover--while freely {{granting}} that the U. S. copyright laws are {{far and away the}} most idiotic that exist anywhere {{on the face of the}} earth--they don't authorize the government to admit pirated books into this country, toll or no toll. And so I think that that regulation is the invention of one of those people--as a rule, early stricken of God, intellectually--the departmental interpreters of the laws, in Washington. They can always be depended on to take any reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it. They can be depended on, every time, to defeat a good law, and make it inoperative--yes, and utterly grotesque, too, mere matter for laughter and derision.

He made one little concession in favor of New York: you could say [...] "New York City," [...] and stop there; but if you left off the [...] "city," [...] you must add [...] "N. Y." [...] to your [...] "New York." [...] Why, it threw the business of the whole country into chaos and brought commerce almost to a stand-still. Now think of that!

60|$|I {{said above}} that Fiesole {{was the mother}} of Florence, and, in spite of formal {{objections}} to the contrary, I venture to defend that now somewhat obsolete and heretical opinion. For why does Fiesole stand just where it does? What made them build a city up there, anyway? Well, a town always exists just where it does exist for some good and amply sufficient reason. Even if, like Fiesole, it is mainly a survival (though at Fiesole there are, indeed, olives in plenty and other live trades to keep a town going), it yet exists there in virtue of facts which once upon a time were quite sufficient to bring the world to the spot, and it goes on existing, partly by mere conservative use and wont, no doubt, but partly also because there are houses, churches, mills, and roads all ready built there. Now, a town must always, from a very early period, have existed upon the exact site of Fiesole. And why? To answer that question you have only to look at the view from the platform. I do not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the ancient Etruscans came there to enjoy the prospect as we go nowadays to the hotels on the Rigi or to the summit of Mount Washington. The ancient Etruscan was a practical man, and his views about views were probably rudimentary. But gaze down for a moment from the cathedral platform upon the valley of the Arno, spread like a glowing picture at your feet, and see how immediately it resolves the doubt. Not, indeed, the valley of the Arno as it stands at present, thick set with tower and spire and palace. In order to arrive at the raison d'être of Fiesole you must blot out mentally Arnolfo's vast pile, and Brunelleschi's dome, and Giotto's campanile, and Savonarola's monastery, and the tall and slender tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, rising like a shaft sheer into the air far, far below--you must blot out, in short, all that makes the world now congregate at Florence, and all Florence itself into the bargain. Nowhere on earth do I know a more peopled plain than that plain of Arno in our own time, seen on a sunny autumn day, when the light glints clearly on each white villa and church and hamlet, from this specular mount of antique Fiesole. But to understand why Fiesole itself stands there at all you must neglect all this, neglect all the wealth of art that makes each inch of that valley classic ground, and look only, if you can for a brief moment, at the bare facts of primitive nature.|$|E
