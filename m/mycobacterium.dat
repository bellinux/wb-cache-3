5|$|In {{a further}} step, some NAD is {{converted}} into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD. In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP {{as the source}} of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as <b>Mycobacterium</b> tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor.|$|E
50|$|Nontuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> (NTM), {{also known}} as {{environmental}} <b>mycobacteria,</b> atypical <b>mycobacteria</b> and <b>mycobacteria</b> other than tuberculosis (MOTT), are <b>mycobacteria</b> which do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy ({{also known as}} Hansen's disease). NTM do cause pulmonary diseases that resemble tuberculosis. Mycobacteriosis is any of these illnesses, usually meant to exclude tuberculosis. They occur in many animals, including humans.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{sporadic}} reports of non-tuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> (NTM) causing {{disease in the}} early part of this century. isolation of NTM from patients with pulmonary disease became more common after sputum culture for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis had become routine by the 1950 s 1. Since then important strides have been made in the taxonomy and identification of non-tuberculous <b>mycobacteria,</b> as well as clarifying their role as human pathogens and importance in human pulmonary disease. It is now well established that <b>mycobacteria</b> other than mammalian tubercle bacilli and M. leprae. are important human pathogens. 2, 3 Various names have been suggested for this group of organisms such as para-tubercle bacilli, pseudotubercle bacilli, unclassified <b>mycobacteria,</b> anonymous <b>mycobacteria,</b> atypical <b>mycobacteria,</b> opportunistic <b>mycobacteria,</b> tuberculoid <b>mycobacteria</b> and <b>mycobacteria</b> other than tubercle bacilli (MOTT).

5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} bacteria that are pathogenic to humans, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis; an earlier (1945) study showed antibiotic activity against <b>Mycobacterium</b> tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by <b>Mycobacterium</b> tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and <b>Mycobacterium</b> tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.|$|E
40|$|Despite decontamination, {{overgrowth}} by pseudomonads renders cultural {{isolation of}} <b>mycobacteria</b> from respiratory specimens {{of patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) difficult or impossible. We performed a prospective study by comparing levels of reduction of overgrowth and recovery of <b>mycobacteria</b> using either pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC) â€“NaOH alone or pretreatment with NALC-NaOH and then with oxalic acid. From 406 specimens of 148 CF patients, 11 specimens were positive for <b>mycobacteria,</b> 5 of which grew <b>mycobacteria</b> after decontamination by either procedure. Three specimens grew <b>mycobacteria</b> only after decontamination with NALC-NaOH, whereas three specimens grew <b>mycobacteria</b> only after treatment with NALC-NaOH followed by oxalic acid but were overgrown after decontamination with NALC-NaOH. Thus, inactivation of <b>mycobacteria</b> by the more aggressive oxalic acid treatment offsets its beneficial effect of reducing the proportion of cultures overgrown with microorganisms other than <b>mycobacteria...</b>|$|R

5|$|Common elands are {{resistant}} to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan infection that has the tsetse fly as a vector, {{but not to the}} Rhipicephalus-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacteria Theileria taurotragi has caused many eland deaths. Clostridium chauvoei, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Eland are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study an eland was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum, and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, R. evertsi, R. pulchellus and R. pravus. Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria, but none for <b>Mycobacterium</b> paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, <b>Mycobacterium,</b> and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{may also}} play a role in <b>Mycobacterium</b> {{tuberculosis}}, which is the agent that causes tuberculosis in humans.

40|$|<b>Mycobacteria</b> are {{intracellular}} pathogens {{that can}} survive within macrophage phagosomes, thereby evading host defense strategies by largely unknown mechanisms. We {{have identified a}} WD repeat host protein that was recruited to and actively retained on phagosomes by living, but not dead, <b>mycobacteria.</b> This protein, termed TACO, represents {{a component of the}} phagosome coat that is normally released prior to phagosome fusion with or maturation into lysosomes. In macrophages lacking TACO, <b>mycobacteria</b> were readily transported to lysosomes followed by their degradation. Expression of TACO in nonmacrophages prevented lysosomal delivery of <b>mycobacteria</b> and prolonged their intracellular survival. Active retention of TACO on phagosomes by living <b>mycobacteria</b> thus represents a mechanism preventing cargo delivery to lysosomes, allowing <b>mycobacteria</b> to survive within macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Goal of {{the study}} : {{analysis}} of drug resistance of certain species of non-tuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> through testing by minimum inhibitory concentrations on the fluid nutritional media. Materials and method : drug resistance of non-tuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> was tested by the method of minimum inhibitory concentrations on the fluid nutritional media. 51 strains of non-tuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> from the species of M. intracellulare, M. avium, M. kansasii, M. gordonae, M. fortuitum, M. abscessus were tested.

40|$|Nontuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> (NTM) are in {{the same}} family as the organisms that cause {{tuberculosis}} and leprosy, but unlike those organisms, NTM are widely dispersed in our environment, vary greatly in their ability to cause disease, and are not spread from person to person.

40|$|AbstractMycobacterium species {{evolved from}} an {{environmental}} recent common ancestor by reductive evolution and lateral gene transfer.

40|$|INTENDED USE BACTEC â„¢ 13 A <b>Mycobacteria</b> Medium is for <b>mycobacteria</b> cultures. Principal use is {{with the}} BACTEC 460 TB System. A {{qualitative}} procedure for the culture and recovery of microorganisms (mainly <b>mycobacteria)</b> from blood. The primary objective of this medium is to detect <b>mycobacteria</b> in patients with depressed immune systems (e. g., Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome [AIDS]). SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The BACTEC Radiometric Technique has been widely used for the rapid recovery of <b>mycobacteria</b> from sputum and other clinical specimens. 1 - 4 In this technique, 14 CO 2 produced by <b>mycobacteria</b> from the metabolism of a 14 C-labeled substrate, present in BACTEC 7 H 12 brand medium, is quantitatively measured. Several investigators have successfully used the BACTEC 460 TB system for isolation of <b>mycobacteria</b> from blood specimens from AIDS patients. 5 - 8 However, processing of blood is required to lyse the cells and concentrate the specimen because only 1 mL of specimen can be inoculated into BACTEC 7 H 12 medium. The use of BACTEC 13 A <b>Mycobacteria</b> Medium eliminates the time-consuming and potentially hazardous processing step by allowing a larger volume (up to 5 mL) of blood to b...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} bovine {{tuberculosis}} and atypical mycobacterioses in cattle {{in developing countries}} is important but difficult because {{of the existence of}} wildlife reservoirs. In cattle farms in Tanzania, <b>mycobacteria</b> were detected in 7. 3 % of 645 small mammals and in cow's milk. The cattle farms were divided into "reacting" and "nonreacting" farms, based on tuberculin tests, and more <b>mycobacteria</b> were present in insectivores collected in reacting farms as compared to nonreacting farms. More <b>mycobacteria</b> were also present in insectivores as compared to rodents. All <b>mycobacteria</b> detected by culture and PCR in the small mammals were atypical <b>mycobacteria.</b> Analysis of the presence of <b>mycobacteria</b> in relation to the reactor status of the cattle farms does not exclude transmission between small mammals and cattle but indicates that transmission to cattle from another source of infection is more likely.

40|$|The {{genetics}} of <b>mycobacteria</b> has {{lagged behind}} because of several reasons. <b>Mycobacteria</b> grow very slowly. their generation time ranging anywhere between 12 - 24 hrs. <b>Mycobacteria</b> are rather hydrophobic {{and tend to}} grow in clusters and there is difficulty in purifying individual cells for genetic analysis. Very few genetic markers {{have been found in}} <b>mycobacteria</b> because there is no known naturally occurring genetic exchange in <b>mycobacteria.</b> With the creation of genomic libraries of M. tuberculosis more than 50 genes have been characterised. Many of them are not expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli (E. coli) under the control of their own promoters, since very few mycobacterial promoters are recognised by the E. coli transcription machinery. This clearly shows that <b>mycobacteria</b> use a different system of gene regulation. Understanding the gene regulation of <b>mycobacteria</b> might throw light on the slow growth rate, about their persistence in a resting phase and also about their intracellular survival. Besides this if inducible or strong promoters are identified they can be used in over expression of genes coding for proteins useful in diagnosis and protection...|$|R
