25|$|Outrigger – a solid hull used to {{stabilise}} a {{canoe and}} positioned rigidly and {{parallel to the}} <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> {{so that it is}} less likely to capsize, and to resist heel when sailing.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the fishing}} boats in Indonesia and the Philippines are double-outrigger craft, {{consisting}} of a narrow <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|For {{stability}} in rougher waters, canoes can be fitted with outriggers. One or two small logs are mounted {{parallel to the}} <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> by long poles. In the case of two outriggers, one is mounted {{to either side of}} the hull. These are called outrigger canoes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{examples}} {{of more than two}} hulls inside a submarine. The light hull of Typhoon-class submarines houses two <b>main</b> pressure <b>hulls,</b> a smaller third pressure hull constituting most of the sail, two other for torpedoes and steering gear, and between the <b>main</b> <b>hulls</b> 20 MIRV SLBMs along with ballast tanks and some other systems. The Royal Netherlands Navy Dolfijn- and Potvis-class submarines housed three <b>main</b> pressure <b>hulls.</b> The Russian submarine Losharik is able to dive over 2000 m with its multi-spherical hull.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated with watertight bulkheads into several compartments. There are also examples {{of more than}} two hulls in a submarine, like the , which has two <b>main</b> pressure <b>hulls</b> and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the <b>main</b> <b>hulls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vaka − The vaka is the <b>main</b> canoe-like <b>hull.</b>|$|R
25|$|Various native {{names of}} the various {{components}} of the proa have also entered the jargon of sailing. The <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> of the proa {{is known as the}} vaka, the outrigger as the ama, and the outrigger supports as the akas. The terms vaka, ama, and aka have been adopted in Western sailing to describe the analogous parts in trimarans.|$|E
25|$|Geosounder {{returned}} to Geraldton on 20 March. Major delays during the installation {{and testing of}} the ROV delayed departure until 29 March, with the survey ship sailing through the path of Cyclone Pancho. Electrical problems with the ROV pushed the start of filming back to 3 April. Sydney {{was the first to}} be inspected, with six ROV dives over a five-day period, during which the <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> and debris field were filmed and documented. The bow had torn free, causing the ship to sink; the <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> section had hit the seabed stern first. This damage corresponded with descriptions given by the Kormoran crew after the battle. Geosounder next travelled to the wreck of Kormoran. The ship had been split into two large pieces by the explosion of the mine deck, which also destroyed the superstructure and scattered debris across a wide area. A possible battle site was located during the sonar search, but observation with the ROV revealed that what was thought to be debris from the ships were actually outcrops of pillow lava.|$|E

50|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{decline in the number of}} {{portholes}} on larger ships. Cruise liners have higher superstructures with more upper deck cabins which can have large windows and balconies. Most warships no longer have portholes on their <b>main</b> <b>hulls</b> as they could weaken them and modern vessels have air conditioning and strong lighting below decks meaning that they are no longer necessary.|$|R
50|$|An {{outrigger}} {{is a small}} side hull {{attached to}} the <b>main</b> load-carrying <b>hull</b> by two or more struts.|$|R

25|$|Artisan {{fishing boats}} are usually small {{traditional}} fishing boats, appropriately {{designed for use}} on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities {{around the world have}} developed their own traditional types of fishing boats, adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 fishing boats, 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small fishing boats. Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|As the Klingons {{are portrayed}} as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually {{depicted}} as warships, heavily armed {{with a variety of}} particle beam weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of cloaking technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons, while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more rugged and primitive construction to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the league}} had many players under {{contract}} by June 1972, including a few NHL {{stars such as}} Bernie Parent, many of its players were career minor leaguers and college players. The new league was not considered much of a threat, until Bobby Hull, arguably the NHL's top forward at the time, jumped to the new league. Hull had not been thought to be seriously considering signing with the WHA {{even though he was}} in contentious salary negotiations with the Chicago Black Hawks, and when he told reporters that he would only move to the WHA [...] "for a million dollars", it was both intended by Hull and taken by his audience to be a joke since a million dollars at that time was considered to be a ridiculous amount of money for a hockey player. Nevertheless, to everyone's surprise, the Winnipeg Jets offered Hull a five-year, one million dollar contract with a one million dollar signing bonus. Hull accepted the Jets' offer, sealing the deal in an elaborate signing ceremony at Portage and <b>Main.</b> <b>Hull's</b> move to the upstart league attracted a few other top stars such as Cheevers, Sanderson, and Tremblay.|$|R
25|$|The Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo, a huge, nine-winged, eight-engine flying boat, {{conceived}} as a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner, was tested without success in 1921. It flew twice, crashing {{at the end of}} the second flight, resulting in serious damage. No further tests were carried out, and most of the aircraft's airframe structure was lost. The only surviving parts (the two side floats, the front section of the <b>main,</b> central <b>hull,</b> one of the Liberty L-12 engines and the control panel) are on display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics, where they have been moved in 2011.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the design}} {{elements}} which Brown used, {{and a number of}} other designers have copied, is the lee pod. [...] The akas extend past the <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> and out to the lee side, and provide support for a cabin extending to the lee of the <b>main</b> <b>hull.</b> [...] This is similar to the platform extending to the lee on some Micronesian proas. [...] The lee pod serves two purposes—it can be used for bunk space or storage, and it provides additional buoyancy on the lee side to prevent a capsize should the boat heel too far. [...] Crew can also be moved onto the lee pod to provide additional heeling force in light winds, allowing the ama to lift under circumstances when it would not otherwise. The Jzero also used water ballast in the ama to allow the righting moment to be significantly increased if needed. While Brown's proa was designed to be a cruising yacht, not a speed-sailing boat, the newer [...] Jzero is capable of speeds of up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The hull's {{bottom is}} {{transversely}} flat and usually bowed fore-and-aft. (This curvature {{is known as}} [...] "rocker".) The stern is frequently a raked narrow transom that tapers sharply toward the bottom forming a nearly double-ended boat. The traditional bottom is made from planks laid fore and aft and not transverse, although some hulls have {{a second set of}} planks laid over the first in a pattern that is crosswise to the <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> for additional wear and strength.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, {{with the}} {{fires in the}} boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>hull</b> of the Destroyer is already a foot under water, and going on down". The crew had no other option than to keep bailing {{and try to keep}} the ship afloat, as the vessel [...] "could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board". By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, {{allowing}} the Destroyer to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Sand Lance, while moored at Charleston, almost sank next to {{the pier}} ahead {{of one of her}} sister ships, the attack {{submarine}} , due to flooding in the engine room's lower level when a <b>main</b> seawater <b>hull</b> valve was being removed for maintenance. Plates, called blanks, had been placed over her hull penetrations by divers to avoid flooding during removal of the valve but had been placed over the wrong main seawater openings. The flooding was stopped, but not before most of the engine room's lower level was flooded.|$|R
