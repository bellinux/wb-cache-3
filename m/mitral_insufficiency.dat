40|$|<b>Mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> is {{the second}} most common heart valve disease and {{untreated}} regurgitation leads to enlargement of the left atrium, atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Besides functional regurgitation, the main cause is degenerative valve disease with elongation of the chordae tendineae and prolapsing of the leaflets. Surgical repair is the gold standard therapy for <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> today. Numerous techniques have been described. Proposed techniques are resection of the prolapsed segment, chordae transfer and ring annuloplasty. Lately, the implantation of neochordae and the loop-technique has been established and is the preferred technique in many centres. There is ongoing discussion about the ideal timing for the intervention in asymptomatic patients. Some groups prefer a watchful waiting strategy; others promote an early intervention, which is also recommended in the guidelines. Results of surgical mitral valve repair are good with low rates of re-intervention and mortality. With minimally invasive techniques, the patient satisfaction is high and hospital stay is short. In conclusion, mitral valve repair should be the preferred strategy in patients with symptomatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> or with asymptomatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> in accordance with the guidelines. Modern repair techniques such as neo-chord implantation with the loop-technique combined with minimally invasive access routes result in low mortality and morbidity and short hospital stay as well as high patient satisfaction...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Mitral</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (MI), mitral {{regurgitation}} or mitral incompetence is [...] {{a disorder}} {{of the heart}} in which [...] the mitral valve does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood. [...] It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, i.e. there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium. MI {{is the most common}} form of valvular heart disease.|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} MI {{can be treated}} with vasodilators as well to {{decrease}} afterload. In the chronic state, {{the most commonly used}} agents are ACE inhibitors and hydralazine. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of <b>mitral</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The current guidelines for treatment of MI limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension, however. Any hypertension is treated aggressively, e.g. by diuretics and a low-sodium diet. In both hypertensive and normotensive cases, digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated. Also, chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation. [...] In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.|$|E
40|$|Force {{development}} and shortening by cardiac muscle {{occur as a}} result of the interaction between actin and myosin within the myofibrillar lattice. This interaction is dependent upon intracellular ionized calcium and is controlled by the troponin-tropomyosin regulatory proteins situated along the actin filament. In this study, we compared the myofibrillar content and myofibrillar Mg-ATPase activity of normal human ventricular muscle with that of ventricular muscle from patients in end-stage failure caused by coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy and ventricular muscle from patients with heart failure due to <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b> The results show that the amount of myofibrillar protein (mg/g wet wt ventricle) in hearts in end-stage failure (coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy) is significantly lower compared with normal hearts and hearts in failure due to <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b> However, the Mg-ATPase activity of myofibriis from hearts in both end-stage failure and failure due to <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> is significantly lower compared with myofibriis from normal hearts. The data suggest that the reduction in the amount of myofibrillar protein hi ventricular tissue is a pivotal event that may be responsible for the progression of heart disease to the point of end-stage failure.

2500|$|Older, small breeds of {{dogs are}} prone to {{congestive}} heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition {{is known to be}} inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. [...] Degenerative valve disease is {{the most common form of}} heart disease in dogs. [...] <b>Mitral</b> <b>insufficiency</b> leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). [...] Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). [...] Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. [...] Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. [...] Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, vasoconstriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. [...] It also results in an increase in diastolic pressure and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan - which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator - is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently.|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: A insuficiência mitral com indicação cirúrgica na faixa etária pediátrica deve ser tratada por meio de plastia sempre que possível, evitando-se os inconvenientes da substituição valvar. O objetivo deste trabalho é propor técnica de plastia mitral baseada em abordagem funcional e anatômica. MÉTODOS: Durante período de 13 meses, foram operadas oito crianças (idade de 2 a 12 anos, média de 6, 37 ± 3, 66 anos) portadoras de insuficiência mitral com realização de anuloplastia {{anterior}} e posterior de forma intermitente, associadas à plastia de Alfieri (passagem de ponto entre as cúspides no ponto de maior regurgitação, formando valva mitral biorificial). RESULTADOS: Não houve óbito nesta série. Ecocardiografia de controle pós-operatório foi realizada em todos os pacientes, com insuficiência mitral discreta em três pacientes, e sem evidência de insuficiência em cinco pacientes. O tempo de permanência em unidade de terapia intensiva variou de 2 a 4 dias (2, 5 ± 0, 75), e o tempo de internação hospitalar variou de 5 a 8 dias (6, 37 ± 1, 06). CONCLUSÃO: Apesar do tamanho limitado da amostra, a opção proposta revelou-se eficaz na avaliação imediata do tratamento da insuficiência mitral isolada em crianças.

The aim {{of this study is to}} describe mitral valve repair technique based on an anatomical and functional approach. METHODS: During a 13 months period, eight children (age ranged from 2 and 12 years old 6. 37 ± 3. 66) with <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> underwent intermittent anterior and posterior annuloplasty associated with Alfieri's repair - performed by placing a stitch between the anterior and posterior leaflets in the point of maximal regurgitation thus creating a double orificial mitral valve.

40|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{biomarkers}} of hemodynamic stress, myocardial necrosis, and renal function might predict adverse outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous repair of severe <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b> Thus, we aimed to assess the predictive value of various established and emerging biomarkers for {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} (MACE) in these patients. Thirty-four patients with symptomatic severe <b>mitral</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> with a mean STS-Score for mortality of 12. 6 % and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 19. 7 % undergoing MitraClip therapy were prospectively included in this study. Plasma concentrations of mid regional-proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), Cystatin C, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), high-sensitive troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin- 3, and soluble ST- 2 (interleukin 1 receptor-like 1) were measured directly before procedure. MACE was defined as cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HF). During a median follow-up of 211 days (interquartile range 133 to 333 days), 9 patients (26. 5 %) experienced MACE (death: 7 patients, rehospitalization for HF: 2 patients). Thirty day MACE-rate was 5. 9 % (death: 2 patients, no rehospitalization for HF). Baseline concentrations of hsTnT (Median 92. 6 vs 25. 2 ng/L), NT-proBNP (Median 11251 vs 1974 pg/mL) and MR-proANP (Median 755. 6 vs 318. 3 pmol/L, all p< 0. 001) were clearly higher in those experiencing an event vs event-free patients, while other clinical variables including STS-Score and logistic EuroSCORE did not differ significantly. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, NT-proBNP and in particular hsTnT and MR-proANP above the median discriminated between those experiencing an event vs event-free patients. This was further corroborated by C-statistics where areas under the ROC curve for prediction of MACE using the respective median values were 0. 960 for MR-proANP, 0. 907 for NT-proBNP, and 0. 822 for hsTnT.
