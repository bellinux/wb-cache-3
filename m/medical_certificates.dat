This method was amended by The Mental Health Act 1959 which stated a person could be admitted upon the recommendation of a medical practitioner who had examined the person. As soon as possible after admission the superintendent of the hospital was required to examine the patient and either approve the recommended admission or discharge the patient.|$|E

25|$|Title IV (Crimes Against Public Interest), section V {{articles}} 174 and 175 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines criminalize the falsification of <b>medical</b> <b>certificates,</b> {{certificates of}} merit or {{service and the}} like. Article 174 imposes a penalty on anyone who produces such certificates and article 175 on anyone who knowingly procures and uses such a certificate. Despite this, news and magazine articles appear {{from time to time}} reporting businesses operating along Claro M. Recto Avenue in Manila which offer fake documents for sale.|$|E

50|$|The Act {{states that}} an {{employee}} {{does not need}} to supply a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> if the employee is away from work for 3 calendar days or less. This removes any unfairness in requiring an employee to supply a costly <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> when taking a short time off work. However, the Act states 3 calendar days, and not work days, so even taking off just 1 day off work, and that is either a Friday or a Monday, technically would require a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate.</b> Furthermore, the Act was later amended that an employer can still request a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> if they have reasonable grounds the employee is not sick, and that the employer agrees to reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining the <b>medical</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|R
25|$|After {{successful}} completion of the MBBS course, one has to compulsorily work in the hospital attached to the medical college {{or in any other}} approved hospital allowed in some medical colleges, for a period of one year. This posting is called the Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship or the House Surgeon in Tamil Nadu. The student gets the degree only after satisfactory completion of the CRRI. An Intern (also called an Internee or a CRRI) is posted in all the clinical departments of the hospital on a rotation basis. This gives him or her the basic clinical and practical knowledge about all the disciplines of medicine and makes the medical graduate fit to work in the community as a General Physician. The schedules of an intern is usually extremely exhaustive. For example, one may have to work for the whole night and then have to start the next day duty only after about one or two hours. This may last till the afternoon. 24-hour sleepless duty at a stretch is not uncommon and sometimes the scheduled breaks are also not allowed by the superiors. He or she is also paid a monthly stipend for his work in the hospital which differs in different medical colleges {{on the basis of the}} management. The person is licensed to practice medicine only after completion of this internship. And only after finishing internship, one can receive his MBBS degree and can pursue postgraduate studies. The Interns are entrusted with clinical responsibilities under the supervision of a Medical teacher or a Resident/ PGT/ Senior medical officer. Interns are not supposed to issue <b>medical</b> <b>certificates,</b> death certificates or medico-legal documents under their own signatures.|$|E

2500|$|Jules Keller, {{a medical}} student, had deserted from the German Army. From Wauwilermoos he sent between 23 August and 2 November 1944 {{at least five}} {{requests}} to {{the address of the}} Federal Commissioner for Internment. Keller asked for health reasons to spend internment near his aunts near Zürich. He argued that because of a chronic gastrointestinal disease he was [...] "cramped and incapacitated" [...] and Keller asked, supported by further justifications and <b>medical</b> <b>certificates,</b> to be transferred to a nursing home. His letters were never answered - similarly, three letters (August/September 1944) sent by Josef Dudkowiak, an officer of the German Air Force. Dudkowiak had deserted after four and a half years, after he had denounced his superior officer for corruption. Dudkowiak also mentioned that he had been sent to the Wauwilermoos penal camp without any explanations.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1942, Furtwängler {{conducted}} {{a performance of}} Beethoven's ninth symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic for Hitler's birthday. [...] At least the final minutes of the performance were filmed and {{can be seen on}} YouTube. [...] At the end, Goebbels came {{to the front of the}} stage to shake Furtwängler's hand. This concert led to heavy criticism of Furtwängler after the war. In fact, Furtwängler had planned several concerts in Vienna during this period to avoid this celebration. [...] But after the defeat of the German army during the Battle of Moscow, Goebbels had decided to make a long speech on the eve of Hitler's birthday to galvanize the German nation. The speech would be followed by Beethoven's ninth symphony. Goebbels wanted Furtwängler to conduct the symphony by whatever means to give a transcendent dimension to the event. He called Furtwängler shortly before to ask him to agree to conduct the symphony but the latter refused arguing that he had no time to rehearse and that he had to perform several concerts in Vienna. But Goebbels forced the organizers in Vienna (by threatening them) to cancel the concerts and ordered Furtwängler to return to Berlin In 1943 and 1944, Furtwängler provided false <b>medical</b> <b>certificates</b> in advance to be sure that such a situation would not happen again.|$|E

60|$|There {{are many}} ludicrous points in our blessed constitution, but perhaps nothing so ludicrous as a juryman praying {{to a judge}} for mercy. He has been caught, shut up in a box, perhaps, {{for five or six}} days together, badgered with half a dozen lawyers till he is nearly deaf with their continual talking, and then he is locked up until he shall die or find a verdict. Such at least is the {{intention}} of the constitution. The death, however, of three or four jurymen from starvation would not suit the humanity of the present age, and therefore, when extremities are nigh at hand, the dying jurymen, with <b>medical</b> <b>certificates,</b> are allowed to be carried off. It is devoutly to be wished that one juryman might be starved to death while thus serving the constitution; the absurdity then would cure itself, and a verdict of a majority would be taken.|$|E

Meantime, Morten, our 'swop' in Canada, keeps the ferocious Canuck humble. When Pij. goes we shall swop Kyd, who's next on the roster, for a Cornstalk or a Maori. But about the education-drill. A boy can't attend First Camp, as we call it, till he is a trained boy and holds his First Musketry certificate. The Education Code says he must be fourteen, and the boys usually go to First Camp at about that age. Of course, they've been to their little private camps and Boys' Fresh Air Camps and public school picnics while they were at school, but First Camp is where the young drafts all meet--generally at Aldershot {{in this part of}} the world. First Camp lasts a week or ten days, and the boys are looked over for {{vaccination}} and worked lightly in brigades with lots of blank cartridge. Second Camp--that's for the fifteen to eighteen-year-olds--lasts ten days or a fortnight, and that includes a final medical examination. Men don't like to be chucked out on <b>medical</b> <b>certificates</b> much--nowadays. I assure you Second Camp, at Salisbury, say, is an experience for a young I.G. officer. We're told off to 'em in rotation. A wilderness of monkeys isn't in it.
