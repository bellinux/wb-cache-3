2500|$|Many {{questioned}} whether {{the time was right}} for a tribute to a group that had just disbanded four years ago, with its former members still active in the music industry. Buendia had mixed feelings about the tribute album, saying that [...] "It’s too early to be taking part in it and I don’t see myself being part of it kasi (because) I’m still doing something here...To be part of it is like acknowledging na tapos na ako (that I am finished); isa na lang akong trophy na itatago na (I'm just a trophy to be shelved). Siguro kung uugud-ugud na ako (<b>Maybe</b> <b>when</b> I'm really old), that’s the time I’m gonna look back."

50|$|Caught between life, love, and {{pursuit of}} the perfect cast-on, these three friends learn that there are never any easy answers, except <b>maybe</b> one-that <b>when</b> the going gets tough, the tough gets knitting.|$|R
50|$|This {{coincided with}} very high {{interest}} rates that prevailed in <b>maybe</b> 1989. <b>When</b> the company missed interest payments and {{was not able to}} renegotiate its position with the Commonwealth Bank, the bank appointed a receiver to the company.|$|R

50|$|This album {{had much}} more impact than Ferré's first Baudelaire effort, <b>maybe</b> because <b>when</b> it was {{published}} Ferré was gaining both success and critical acclaim on stage, and Aragon was an active poet and a controversial committed communist figure in the French intellectual field.|$|R
3000|$|They {{might use}} their {{imagination}} and creativity at every stage, however they might use it more at some stages. For example, they might use their imagination/creativity less while recording data whereas {{they use it}} a lot when making an observation and <b>maybe</b> more <b>when</b> making a deduction. Still, imagination and creativity are present at every stage. (Sevgi, post-interview) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well,' says I, 'maybe you've {{really got}} kleptopigia. And <b>maybe</b> <b>when</b> {{we get out}} of the pig belt you'll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct.

6000|$|... "That's {{no great}} odds," [...] Jack said. [...] "It can't be much worse {{stopping}} {{a few months}} in a Russian prison, than spending the winter upon the heights.

6000|$|... "Honest work," [...] he replied, [...] "hurts no one, {{unless they}} are full of sickly fancies. It's idleness that brings sin. They tell me you've new creeds amongst those in your walk of life, and a new manner of living. Live as you will, then, but let others do the same.

25|$|A {{performance}} of The17's SURROUND, originally {{planned to take}} place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012.

[...] "I thought you'd be feeling a bit tired and hungry, <b>maybe,</b> so <b>when</b> I came over to open up I put on a fire and brewed you up a cup of tea.

60|$|To be sure--{{everybody}} knows, {{everybody in}} the world knows, when it is Spring with us, the trees are withering there, when it is Summer with us, the snow is falling there, and have I not myself heard the lambs that are there all bleating on a cold November day--to be sure, does not everybody with an intellect know that; and <b>maybe</b> <b>when</b> it's night with us, it is day with them, for many a time I have seen the roads lighted before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, thank Heaven!" [...] Stephen replied. [...] "I was {{too near}} the sorrow that fell upon our house when our father died {{with a broken}} heart. There were the other two as well--one with a bullet in his brain, the other a drunkard. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>when</b> I was your age, I felt at times what I suppose you feel.

She'd do you as little harm as any of them." ...|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the sexual habits and {{lifespan}} of this worm, but researchers hypothesize that sexual reproduction starts at an early stage, <b>maybe</b> even <b>when</b> the worm is about 100 mm in length; this is very early, considering these worms can grow to sizes of nearly 3 m in some cases (although most observations point to a much lower average length of 1 m and an average of 25 mm in diameter).|$|R

50|$|The Diocese of Stavanger was {{established}} in the 12th century (either 1112 or <b>maybe</b> 1125) <b>when</b> it was separated from the Ancient Diocese of Bergen. Initially, the large diocese covered the (modern) counties of Rogaland, Aust-Agder, and Vest-Agder as well as the regions of Valdres (in Oppland county), Hallingdal (in Buskerud county), and the parishes of Eidfjord and Røldal (in Hordaland county). After the Protestant Reformation, the Diocese of Stavanger continued in the new Church of Norway.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hot shaving-water!' says he, {{bursting}} {{out laughing}} (and I confess not without reason). 'Is it yourself you're going to shave?' said he. 'And <b>maybe</b> <b>when</b> I {{bring you up}} the water I'll bring you up the cat too, and you can shave her.' I flung a boot at the scoundrel's head in reply to this impertinence, and was soon with my friends in the parlour for breakfast. There was a hearty welcome, and the same cloth {{that had been used}} the night before: as I recognised by the black mark of the Irish-stew dish, and the stain left by a pot of porter at supper.|$|E

6000|$|... "No? Everyone's talkin' of it. The {{long and}} short {{of it is that}} Min Palmer has had a regular up-and-down row with Rose Fuller and turned her and her little gal out of doors. I believe the two women had an awful time. Min's a Tartar when her temper's up--and that's pretty often. Nobody knows how Rose managed to put up with her so long. But she has had to go at last. Goodness knows what the poor critter'll do. She hasn't a cent nor a relation--she was just an orphan girl that Palmer brought up. She is at Rawlingses now. <b>Maybe</b> <b>when</b> Min cools off, she'll let her go back but it's doubtful. Min hates her like p'isen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mashinini {{attended}} the 1955 Congress of the People in Kliptown, {{a major event}} for the African National Congress (ANC). She later wrote: [...] "I was not a card-carrying member, but at that meeting I was a member in body, spirit and soul... So I think that Congress was really an eye-opener for me. That, <b>maybe,</b> is <b>when</b> I started to be politicized. Although there is another thing, which I have always felt, which is that I have always resented being dominated." ...|$|R

Why does she always keep a lemon in her drawer? When did she last have her hair cut? I'll tell you if you care to know--the week before he came, five months ago. She used to have it cut once a fortnight: said it tickled her neck. Why does she jump on people when they call her Tommy {{and tell them that}} her name is Jane?

Now that was eighty years since, for we don't count old Herman Mordaunt's time as anything; seeing that the land was worth next to nothin' in his time. The {{interest}} on ten cents at seven per cent, is seven mills a year, or five hundred and sixty mills for eighty years. This is without compound; compound being unlawful, and nothin' agin law should be taken into the account. Add the ten cents to the five hundred and sixty mills, and you get six hundred and sixty mills, or sixty-six cents.

60|$|The {{regret that}} had been his {{returned}} with thought of her. The saddest disillusion of his life, the keenest disappointment, the strangest pain, would always be associated with her.

40|$|Climate change {{influences}} on the major pillars of food security. Each of the four elements of food security (availability,access,utilization,andstability) is vulnerable to changes in climate. For example,reductions in production related to regional drought influence food availability at multiple scales. Changes in price influences the ability of certain populations to purchase food (access). Utilization <b>maybe</b> affected <b>when</b> production zones shift, reducing the availability of preferred or culturally appropriate types of food within a region.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the debate on mandatory minimum sentences by analzing them {{in the context of}} the corporation as criminal and by employing a law and economics methodology. While the rational economic actor model <b>maybe</b> unrealistic <b>when</b> applied to individuals committing blue-collar crimes, it is a much more useful tool to describe the behaviour of criminal corporations that respond more directly to economic incentives. The article concludes that the mandatory fine for a corporation found guilty of a criminal offence should, at a minimum, equal the expected loss caused or profit gained from the wrongdoing...|$|R
