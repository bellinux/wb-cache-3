25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{way that was}} disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I {{did not tell the}} public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E

He did not receive any high awards upon his return, a fact that bothered him. Bigger awards went to [...] "career men", he told Kramish. However, he ended his correspondence by {{saying that he was}} not protesting his treatment; [...] " [...] that I did not find <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Gulag, as might well have happened". Koval died in his Moscow apartment on January 31, 2006, at the age of 92.|$|E

500|$|When {{he began}} {{recording}} Confessions in 2003, Usher claimed {{he did not}} want to work with any new producers. Production began between Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who produced his last two albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher stated, [...] "With this album I chose some new producers who I figured would definitely allow me to really articulate <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different way... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta look for something different." [...] Dupri also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox. The album features productions by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Just Blaze, R. Kelly, and Usher's brother James Lackey.|$|E

I think I might find that restful as the anger of middle-age sets in." [...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E

The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E

Grande previewed the accompanying music video {{for the single}} through social media on March 26, 2016 and March 29, 2016. The clip was officially premiered on Vevo in the night of March 31, 2016. Directed by production company The Young Astronauts. In interview with Idolator, Grande explained: “We’re doing two visuals because this song makes me feel two kinds of ways, {{it makes me feel}} sexy and glamorous — I wanted to do a simpler more glam-themed video — and then I wanted to do another video because it makes me feel… like a super version of <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way.” Discussing the song with Madeline Rotj from MTV, Grande stated about the concept behind the song's second video: ...|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Derulo, E. Kidd Bogart, Lindy Robbins and Emanuel [...] "Eman" [...] Kiriakou, who also {{produced}} the track. The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to put <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel like if I found that one true love. I've basically described {{what it would be}} like if I found her." [...] Derulo further elaborated about the concept of the song in another interview with Matt Elias of MTV News: ...|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. [...] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{concluding}} One Thousand and One Afternoons, Hecht went on {{to produce}} novels, plays, screenplays, and memoirs, {{but none of these}} eclipsed his early success in finding the stuff of literature in city life. Recalling that period, Hecht wrote, [...] "I haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops.
