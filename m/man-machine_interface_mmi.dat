For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process.

For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of haptic and tactile information {{is a basic}} human ability. Especially in classical open surgery physicians are used to relying on these capabilities, e. g. for palpation, for reliably tightened knots or for intraoperative tissue differentiation, and for intraoperative recognition of unusual or abnormal tissue locations. In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), however, the patient’s skin forms a highly effective barrier between operating field and surgeon, confining the transmission of haptic and tactile information to the tools being used. Even worse, in minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) – the advancement of MIS – the surgeon is actually totally mechanically decoupled from the patient. This leads to a complete loss of haptic and tactile feedback. The establishment of pure kinesthetic impressions in robot assisted MIS has already been realized in a promising manner.

40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} {{acceptance}} of <b>man-machine</b> <b>interfaces</b> (<b>MMI),</b> personalized talking heads are helpful. Personalization means that the head shown on the display depicts someone known to the person operating the machine. A typical application is the MMI of a humanoid robot. To design a three-dimensional talking head, two 2 D-images are required, one being the front view of the speaker’s head, the other the lateral view which is orthogonal {{with respect to the}} front view. For simplification, non-orthogonal 2 D-images are preferred. The construction of the individualized 3 D-head is accomplished by modifying a generic head model consisting of 283 knots defining a mesh of triangles. Three steps lead from the non-orthogonal 2 D-images to the individualized 3 D-head: At first, the reference points of the model are transformed into the reference points of the pose-dependent 2 D-images. In the second step the triangle-based mesh model of the non-orthogonal 2 D-images is constructed by the Dirichlet Free-Form Deformation starting from the reference and some contour points, respectively. Finally the 283 points of the non-orthogonal 2 D-images are transformed into the individualized 3 D-head by the inverse of the transform found in the first step and texture information is added. 1. The task The task discussed in this paper is as follows: Given two images In, n = 1, 2 depicting the front of a speaker’s head together with parts of {{the left and the right}} side, respectively, a 3 D-talking head has to be constructed.
