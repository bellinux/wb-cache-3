5000|$|General Electric's Porta-Color was {{the first}} [...] "portable" [...] color {{television}} introduced in the United States. The Porta-Color set introduced a new variation of the shadow <b>mask</b> <b>display</b> tube invented by RCA. It had the electron guns arranged in an in-line configuration, rather than RCA's delta arrangement. The GE tube otherwise used {{the same kind of}} round dot phosphors as RCA, The main benefit of the in-line gun arrangement is that it simplified the convergence process, thus making true portability possible. There were many variations of this set produced from its introduction in 1966 until 1978, all using GE's Compactron vacuum tubes (valves).|$|E
40|$|Using a signal-detection task, the {{generality}} of Turvey's (1973) onset-onset {{rule was}} tested in four experiments. After seeing, in succession, (1) {{one or two}} letters (target display), (2) a multiletter detection display, and (3) a <b>mask</b> <b>display,</b> subjects decided {{whether or not the}} letter or letters in the target display reappeared in the succeeding detection display at different levels of detection-display duration in various situations. The subjects' sensitivity was inconsistent with the onset-onset rule. More specifically, sensitivity increased with increases in display duration within a fixed stimulus onset asynchrony of 150 msec. Display duration, however, had no effect on response bias. Nor was there any interaction between display duration and display size in terms of either sensitivity or response bias. The more complicated relationship between display duration and display size does not invalidate the departure from the onset-onset rule...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{integrated}} research environment (RAVEN) {{that we have}} developed {{for the purpose of}} developing and testing object tracking algorithms. As a Windows application, RAVEN provides a user interface for loading and viewing video sequences and interacting with the segmentation and object tracking algorithms, which are included at run time as plug-ins. The plug-ins interact with RAVEN via a programming interface, enabling algorithm developers to concentrate on their ideas rather than on the user interface. Over the past two years, RAVEN has greatly enhanced the productivity of our researchers, enabling them to create a variety of new algorithms and extend RAVEN's capabilities via plug-ins. Examples include several object tracking algorithms, a live-wire segmentation algorithm, a methodology for the evaluation of segmentation quality, and even a mediaprocessor implementation of an object tracker. After implementing an algorithm, RAVEN makes it easy to present the results since it provides several <b>mask</b> <b>display</b> modes and output options for both image and video. We have found that RAVEN facilitates the entire research process, from prototyping an algorithm to visualization of the results to a mediaprocessor implementation...|$|E

40|$|THE {{forthcoming}} {{meeting of}} the C. C. I. R. {{at the end of}} this month in Vienna to discuss, and this time we hope define, colour TV standards serves as yet another reminder that although we in this country have now had high-definition "penny plain " television on and off for thirty years, "twopence coloured " is still just around the corner. It has been there for the best part of ten years, ever since the Radio Corporation of America and the National Broadcasting Company put forward the blue print which was subsequently approved and endorsed by the Federal Communications Commission. As an example of intellectual. boldness and practical engineering achievement it ranks with the pioneering work in Great Britain of Schoenberg and his colleagues at E. M. I. and Marconi on the 405 -line black-and-white system and will stand as a monument to American technical enterprise in the middle of the 20 th century. It has been adopted in those countries which now boast regular colour television services.

The mask is stark white and depicts a caracature of someone screaming and crying at the same time. [...] Designer Sleiertin stated that the <b>mask</b> <b>displayed</b> different emotions, [...] "It's a horrible look, it's a sorry look, it's a frantic look".

5000|$|The {{vertical}} wires of {{the aperture}} grille have a resonant frequency and will vibrate in sympathetic resonance with loud sounds near the display, resulting in fluttering and shimmering of {{colors on the}} display. To reduce these resonant effects, one or two horizontal stabilizing wires, called [...] "damping wires", are welded across the grille wires, and may be visible as fine dark lines {{across the face of}} the screen. These stabilizing wires provide the easiest way to distinguish aperture grille and shadow <b>mask</b> <b>displays</b> at a glance. The stabilized grille can still vibrate but the sounds need to be [...] the display.|$|R

He can also twirl them or throw a wide array to block attacks, or can throw many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in most any material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask's roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion's are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight's are white.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{exposure}} to a word is shown to improve its later identification in a brief, <b>masked</b> <b>display</b> when a free report task is used, but not in two-alternative forced choice or single-probe matching tasks that eliminate certain bias effects and provide an assessment of discriminability. Mo'dified forced choice and single-probe tasks were also used, in which subjects attempted to identify the target before presentation of the probe(s). This modification produced a discriminability advantage for old words, {{but only in the}} single-probe task. We argue that prior exposure does not enhance sensory processing of a target word; rather, it increases the fluency with which the target comes to mind when presented under difficult viewing conditions. In forced choice and single-probe tasks, fluency associated with processing the target may be ignored in deference to discriminating among or evaluating the processing of the probe(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Working memory {{consolidation}} {{denotes the}} process that enables sensory information to be stored in short-term memory. What is currently unclear is how long this process takes and whether it continues after a stimulus has been masked. Here, we address these matters by examining whether the consolidation of visual stimuli can still be disturbed even {{after they have been}} masked. Participants viewed brief and <b>masked</b> <b>displays</b> of letters or Kanji characters that had to be memorized and that could be followed at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) by a visual or auditory discrimination task. Memory performance improved as SOA increased from 100 to 1000 ms, revealing what may be called a ‚Äúcognitive backward masking effect‚Äù caused by the discrimination tasks. Taken together, the results show that working memory consolidation is a time-consuming but volatile process that continues after a stimulus has been masked and that can be disrupted by executing another task...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of attentional deployment before saccade execution was studied with a dual-task paradigm. Observers made a horizontal saccade whose direction was indicated by a symbolic precue {{and had to}} discriminate the orientation of a Gabor patch displayed at different delays after the precue (but before saccade onset). The patch location relative to the saccadic target was indicated to observers before each block. Therefore, on each trial, observers were informed simultaneously about the respective absolute locations of the saccadic and perceptual targets. The main result is that orientational acuity improved {{over a period of}} 150 - 200 ms after the precue onset at the saccadic target location, where overall performance is best, and at distant locations. This effect is due to attentional factors rather than to an alerting effect. It is also dependent on the efficiency of the temporal <b>masks</b> <b>displayed</b> before and after the Gabor patches...|$|R
