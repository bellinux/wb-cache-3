50|$|Drug {{delivery}} systems, lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles, can {{be designed}} to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients. When designed to avoid the body's defence mechanisms, nanoparticles have beneficial properties {{that can be used}} to improve drug delivery. Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed, including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm. Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently. Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal. For example, a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist, improving the solubility. Drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release; reduce drug clearance rates; or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue. However, the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host's reactions to nano- and <b>microsized</b> materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body. Nevertheless, a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems. While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles, the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between Mo species and a conventionally <b>microsized</b> and particularly nanosized HZSM- 5 support was studied by high-resolution multinuclear solid-state NMR techniques. As proved by Al- 27 and Si- 29 MAS {{as well as}} CP/MAS NMR investigations, this interaction {{was so strong that}} the framework aluminum of both <b>microsized</b> and nanosized HZSM- 5 zeolites could be extracted. With increasing Mo loading, more nonframework aluminum, resonanced at ca. 30 ppm, appeared in the Al- 27 MAS NMR spectrum of the Mo-loaded nanosized HZSM- 5 catalyst. Meanwhile, this strong interaction {{led to the formation of}} more new Al- 2 (MoO 4) (3) crystallines on the nanosized HZSM- 5 support than on the <b>microsized</b> HZSM- 5 support. The appearance of Al- 2 (MoO 4) (3) crystallines resulted in fewer active catalysts for the methane dehyro-aromatization. The results of H- 1 MAS NMR using perfluorotributyl amine as a probe molecule demonstrated that Mo species preferentially reacted with the silanols and nonframework AlOH on the external surface of <b>microsized</b> and nanosized HZSM- 5 zeolites. In addition, impregnated Mo species remained predominantly on the external surface of the nanosized HZSM- 5 zeolite, although there was a possibility that they might migrate into the lattice channels of the <b>microsized</b> HZSM- 5 zeolite. The migration of some Mo species into the zeolite channels might be beneficial for the conversion of methane to aromatics in the absence of oxygen. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|E
30|$|After the {{calculation}} of cross-link density of unfilled and filled NR composites with MS of different <b>microsize</b> particles in the data obtained (Figure 5), it can be observed that the cross-link density increases from 10 to 90 pphr in the MS-filled NR composite. When the MS content increases, the cross-link density also increases. It may due to the increasing amount of filler in the rubber matrix. The molecular movement of the rubber reduces and {{makes it more difficult}} for toluene to penetrate through the rubber matrix. NR composites containing small <b>microsize</b> MS particle have better performed their cross-link density as compared to those containing larger <b>microsize</b> MS.|$|R

This causes many difficulties, called “size effects”. In order to understand and overcome the difficulties associated with these effects, mechanical testing machines and methods for <b>microsized</b> specimens with load resolutions the order of 100 µN and a displacement resolution of 10 nm have been developed. <b>Microsized</b> cantilever beam specimens (approximately 10 x 10 x 50 µm) of Ni- 11. 5 mass%P amorphous alloy have been used to investigate the fracture behaviour on the <b>microsized</b> material in this work. This includes the calculation of fracture toughness values, examination of the effect of the presence of a fatigue precrack on fracture toughness and the effects of testing at elevated temperature. Fracture behaviour differs between specimens with and without a fatigue precrack. This indicates that even a notch with a root radius of 0. 25 µm cannot be regarded as a crack for these <b>microsized</b> specimens. Comparison of fracture toughness values for specimens with different crack growth directions (in-plane and out-of-plane directions) suggests that the Ni-P amorphous thin film exhibits anisotropic fracture behaviour. ...|$|E

30|$|As the MS content increases, the NR in {{the matrix}} {{progressively}} decreases and is {{replaced with the}} MS, which renders it stiff to aggregate within the matrix to form a three-dimensional reticulate structure. The increased moduli of the filled NR composites are due to the reduced elasticity and increased rigidity of the rubber matrix. The modulus (at 100 %, 200 %, and 300 % elongation) of the NR composite filled with 10 -μm MS particle increases with increasing MS loading, whereas that of NR composites filled with 20 - and 75 -μm MS also increases with the increasing MS loading, but a smaller trend is found in both NR compounds filled with 20 - and 75 -μm MS. Evidently, the modulus decreases as the <b>microsize</b> of MS particle increases. It can be deduced that MS with smaller <b>microsize</b> is more compatible with the rubber than the larger one. This is also an indication that smaller <b>microsize</b> particles have a better interaction with the rubber.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To fully {{understand}} the cytotoxicity of after-degradation QDs, we synthesized CdS QDs and investigated its toxicity mechanism. Methods: Biomimetic method was proposed to synthesize cadmium sulfide (CdS) QDs. Thereafter MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was conducted to evaluate their cytotoxicity. To investigate the toxicity mechanism, we subsequently conducted intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement with DCFH-DA, glutathione (GSH) measurement with DTNB, and cellular cadmium assay using atomic absorption spectrometer. <b>Microsized</b> CdS were simultaneously tested as a comparison. Results: MTT assay results indicated that CdS QDs are more toxic than <b>microsized</b> CdS especially at concentrations below 40 mu g/ml. While <b>microsized</b> CdS did not trigger ROS elevation, CdS QDs increase ROS by 20 - 30 % over control levels. However, they both deplete cellular GSH significantly at the medium concentration of 20 mu g/ml. In the presence of NAC, cells are partially protected from CdS QDs, but not from <b>microsized</b> particles. Additionally, nearly 20 % of cadmium was released from CdS nanoparticles within 24 h, which also accounts for QDs' toxicity. Conclusion: Intracellular ROS production, GSH depletion. and cadmium ions (Cd(2 +)) release are possible mechanisms for CdS QDs' cytotoxicity. We also suggested that with QD concentration increasing, the principal toxicity mechanism changes from intracellular oxidative stress to Cd(2 +) release.

40|$|The thermal and {{hydrothermal}} stabilities of HZSM- 5 zeolites with crystal sizes {{less than}} 100 nm {{have been studied}} by multinuclear solid-state NMR, combined with BET and XRD. As evidenced by Al- 27 and Si- 29 MAS {{as well as their}} corresponding cross-polarization/MAS NMR investigations, the thermal stability of nanosized HZSM- 5 is not so good as that of <b>microsized</b> HZSM- 5. This is due to two processes concerning dealumination and desilicification involved in the calcination of nanosized HZSM- 5, while only the dealumination process is conducted in <b>microsized</b> HZSM- 5 under the similar calcination process. The hydrothermal stability of nanosized HZSM- 5 is, contrary to what was expected, not so bad as that of the <b>microsized</b> HZSM- 5 in the course of steam treatment. The actual resistance of the hydrothermal stability to the crystal size of HZSM- 5 can be ascribed to an active reconstruction of zeolitic framework through an effective filling of amorphous Si species into nanosized HZSM- 5 during hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|International audienceLA-ICP-MS {{analysis}} of the chemical composition of biogenic carbonate has many applications in the environmental sciences but {{the characteristics of the}} material produced by the ablation process are largely unknown. To fill this gap, we have undertaken a study of the chemical and physical nature of particles produced by laser ablation of biogenic carbonates. SEM imaging suggests that laser ablation produces two distinct particle populations, one consisting of <b>microsize</b> particles and the other of nanosize particles. A 213 nm laser gives rise to a higher proportion of <b>microsize</b> particles than a 193 nm laser, probably because the 213 nm laser couples less completely with carbonate material. The <b>microsize</b> particles appear to form by photomechanical fracturing along lines of cleavage or weakness, rather than by hydrodynamic sputtering (as is generally observed for silicates). Chemical {{analysis of}} the carbonate particles suggests that little chemical fractionation of biogenic carbonates occurs during the ablation process or during transport to the plasma. This is supported by the constancy of the fractionation factor ([X/Ca](measured) /[X/Ca] true) during the course of an ablation of a carbonate standard. In contrast, changes in the fractionation factor during the first few seconds of ablation of the NIST 612 are observed for some elements. This difference in fractionation is likely to result from the different formation mechanisms of the <b>microsize</b> particles...|$|R

30|$|Our earlier works [13, 14] {{too have}} {{considered}} only nanosize particles for the thermal performance enhancement of PCMs. At present, the nanoparticles are not economically viable {{as the cost}} of nanoparticles is roughly 25 times that of <b>microsize</b> (1  μm =  10 − 6 m) particles of same material. This is due to mainly the processing cost. However, no work has investigated <b>microsize</b> particle-dispersed PCMs until now. Hence, the primary objective of this work is to examine the role of high conductivity <b>microsize</b> particles in augmenting the heat transfer performance of pure PCM as well as the exergy performance of the storage system. To the best of our knowledge, this is a maiden attempt investigating the cheaper form (<b>microsize)</b> of conductivity particles. Since microparticles are used in the present work as against the nanoparticles considered in our earlier works [13, 14], the methodology of investigation differs completely. Firstly, the thermo-physical properties of microparticles–PCM composites are evaluated experimentally as the analytical procedure employed in earlier works [13, 14] is valid for only nanoparticles–PCM composites. Secondly, the numerical modeling technique adopted here is quite different from that one used for nanoparticles system. This is because the formulation needs {{to take into account the}} migration of such <b>microsize</b> particles due to non-uniform shear fields in the liquid which is not the case when it comes to nanoparticles. Because of the expected particle migration, the present formulation also includes the momentum equation which of course is not considered for nanoparticle composites. As the particles are expected to continue migrating all the time, the present work aims at investigating the consequences of particle migration from performance enhancement point of view. This work is also intended to compare the relative benefits/shortcomings of microparticles dispersion in comparison with nanoparticles dispersion. The comparison is also extended to positive and adverse effects of particles dispersion on the exergy performance of conventional PCM.|$|R

These biomimetic photonic structures can feature a broad range of vivid bright colors, which can be tuned across the UV−visible spectrum by engineering their nanoporous structure through different anodization parameters. The effective medium of NAA-DBRs films is systematically assessed {{as a function of the}} anodization period, the anodization temperature, and the current density ratio by reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). This analysis makes it possible to establish the most sensitive structure toward changes in its effective medium. Subsequently, specific detection of vitamin C molecules is demonstrated. The obtained results reveal that NAA-DBRs with optimized structure can achieve a low limit of detection for vitamin C molecules as low as 20 nM, a sensitivity of 227 ± 4 nmμM− 1, and a linearity of 0. 9985.

This is the first anode material study done using the most sustainably designed <b>microsized</b> MFC to date, which utilizes ambient oxygen as the electron acceptor with an air cathode instead of the chemical ferricyanide and without a membrane.
