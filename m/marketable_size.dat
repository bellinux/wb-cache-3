40|$|Abstract only availableThe primary study {{objective}} determined whether rearing high-percentage-male (> 70 % male) bluegill {{groups in}} intensively-managed standard production ponds results in higher fish growth rates {{and production of}} higher numbers of large, food-size sunfish (> 227 g; 0. 5 lb), versus when balanced-sex-ratio (~ 50 % male) groups are reared over a two-year period. A cull harvesting approach was also implemented {{in an attempt to}} increase the number of food-size sunfish produced in the balanced-sex-ratio and high-percentage-male groups. The research project proposed herein is related to an initiative through the North Central Regional Aquaculture Center (NCRAC) to develop capacity to efficiently rear sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) to large sizes (> 227 g; 0. 5 lbs) as food fish (NCRAC 1999). Strong demand has been repeatedly indicated for sunfish as a food fish, however, incapacity to efficiently rear these fish to required sizes has kept this demand from being tested (Hayward and Wang 2006). A method of topping-off harvest was implemented to control the presence of social hierarchies which will improve the rearing efficiency of bluegill for the purpose of <b>marketable</b> <b>sized</b> food fish. Mostly male skewed sex-ratios will indicate that larger growth is attainable without the presence of a large female population. The results of this study have not shown statistically significant differences between the treatment and control ponds (formulas are still being calculated). This study will support the need for improved rearing techniques, as the demand for innovative food production becomes greater. As the United States starts becoming more reliant on aquaculture, the support and demand for related research will become more widely accepted and encouraged. In addition, the ability to improve the rearing efficiency of bluegill can ultimately be applied to many other species of aquaculture food-fish. McNair Scholars Progra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Low yields {{caused by}} viral {{diseases}} and their financial consequences {{are the most}} important risks jeopardizing commercial shrimp culture in Mexico. Hence, farmers are continuously testing different production strategies to keep their operations into profitable margins. An optimization model was designed based on a farm's (139 ha) database (2001 - 2005) to find the strategy that maximizes profit resulting from the optimal combination of three decision variables; stocking density, length of grow-out period and initial culture time. The model interface is in Excel" using risk analysis software (@RISK", RISKOPTIMIZER"). Five non-linear multiple regression models were created to describe growth at different stocking densities (6 - 9 Pl/m 2, 10 - 14, 15 - 19, 20 - 24, 25 - 30), randomizing mortality rates, temperatures and feeding ratios; the model was optimized with genetic algorithm-based techniques. Results for production scenarios with the five stocking densities and two initial culture periods March-April and May-June, showed similar harvest weights (min 18 g - max 22) to maximize profit but different length of grow-out period (18 - 22 weeks, 16 - 19) favoring the second stocking period due to higher survival rates (33 %- 41 %, 38 %- 45 %) and yields (0. 69 - 1. 84 tons, 0. 74 - 2. 1). Also, the probability of achieving an operation profit margin ratio of 35 % was higher (61 %, 97 %) with less cost ($ 409, 834 U. S. dollar, $ 398, 895) and higher profits ($ 263, 356, $ 325, 512). Optimal solution points out stocking ponds at warmer temperatures (May-June), what brings about reaching <b>marketable</b> <b>sizes</b> faster, reducing operation costs and mainly, reducing the intrinsic risk of longer culture periods. The effect of stocking density is not conclusive. These results confirm the current industry trend to perform one production cycle starting in warmer months as a way to reduce disease and financial risks...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{establish}} trends in the cast net fishery of Kainji Lake, Nigeria. The cast net fishery was second in importance to the gillnet fishery {{in the early years}} after impoundment of the lake and still continues to be {{an important component of the}} fishery. Some of the economically important species such as Citharinus spp, Tilapia spp, Labeo spp, Alestes spp and Synodontis spp are exploited by cast nets. The study has not revealed any drastic perturbation in the species diversity, catch composition, and any real ecosystem overfishing. On the other hand, both the catfish, Auchenoglanis spp and the predator Hydrocynus spp appear to have increased in the catch in recent years. Never-the-less there is a decline in the mean weight of the major exploited fish species due to the capture of under sized fishes without allowing them to grow to 'legally' <b>marketable</b> <b>sizes.</b> The use of small meshed cast net and also fishing in the shallow waters of the lake can give rise to this situation. Thus, there are signs of growth overfishing in the fish stocks. It must also be acknowledged that the situation is complicated by the fact that in a multi-gear fishery as on Kainji Lake, the cast net fishery could not be managed in isolation without due regard to the other competing gears. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has declined in the cast net fishery possibly due to the increase in effort by the major fishing gears over the years. The ongoing extension campaigns by the KLFPP appears to be having the desired effect, as there was reduction in the number of the major fishing gears on the Lake in 1997. It can be anticipated that if this trend continues, the CPUE will recover in the long run. Yields observed from the mesh selectivity study revealed that for major species in the cast net fishery, both by number and weight, were maximal at 2. 5 inch mesh, which contrasts with the fact that current minimum allowable mesh in the Fisheries Edict for the Lake is 2. 0 inch. The adoption of 2. 5 inch as the minimum allowable mesh in the cast net fishery is recommended to be included in future revision of existing regulations. It is also recommended that for this control to have a desired effect, the casting of the net from the shore should be prohibited so as to reduce the incidence of juvenile mortality in the nursery areas.

40|$|The {{groupers}} (Family Serranidae) {{are among}} the most popular species in the live reef food fish industry in the Asia-Pacific region. Groupers are generally fast growing, hardy, suitable for intensive culture, and with excellent characteristics for processing. The high demand for these fishes is due to their unique culinary attributes and scarcity. In 1997, the Asia-Pacific region contributed about 90 % to the total world aquaculture production. The regional production of farmed grouper was estimated at 15, 000 tons, with China as the biggest producer contributing 8, 000 tons followed closely by Indonesia. Other countries in the region commonly produce 1, 000 - 2, 000 tons annually in 1990 - 1997. Groupers are generally cultured in floating net cages or earthen ponds, but cage culture is more common in Southeast Asia. Grouper pond production is becoming an attractive alternative to intensive shrimp culture in countries where management problems have forced growers to abandon shrimp farming. Although grouper culture is widespread in Asia and the Pacific, its continued development is constrained by the limited availability of fingerlings. Most economies, with the recent exception of Chinese Taipei, rely almost totally on wild-caught fry and fingerlings for stocking. This demand for wild seeds has led to unsustainable and illegal collection practices {{such as the use of}} cyanide to capture large numbers of seed with relatively less investment in time and effort. The inadequate supply of seed is further aggravated by the lack of appropriate handling techniques during collection, transport and storage of collected fish, and sometimes by an unregulated management of the wild stocks. There is also the lack of appropriate techniques for efficient grouper culture to <b>marketable</b> <b>sizes.</b> A major production constraint is heavy mortality of groupers during the collection and culture phases due to handling stress and diseases. The utilization of non-destructive devices for grouper collection, proper fish handling and increased efficiency in culture management can result to socio-economic and environmental benefits. A well-developed grouper culture operation complemented by appropriate wild grouper fishery management can provide sustainable employment to many people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from marginal fishers to farmers to traders. Grouper fisheries based on illegal or destructive fishing practices underlines the urgent need for habitat protection and sustainable utilization of natural resources. The objective of this manual is to provide a farmer-friendly practical guide for grouper farmers in the Asia-Pacific economies. It is hoped that this manual will enhance farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to culture and handle grouper, as well as to prevent and manage disease outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Elstarâ€™, {{the main}} apple {{cultivar}} {{grown in the}} Netherlands, requires adequate thinning to reach <b>marketable</b> fruit <b>sizes</b> and to achieve regular yields by preventing alternate bearing. At the moment, chemical thinning of â€˜Elstarâ€™ is the only economically feasible way of thinning. Thinning by hand is labour intensive and thus too expensive. Furthermore, hand thinning is usually carried out after June-drop, by which time only increases in fruit size are achieved and no reduction in alternate bearing. Up to 2004, carbaryl was the only effective fruit-thinning chemical Dutch growers had at their disposal. However, carbaryl is no longer officially registered for thinning apples. Thus, another agent for thinning â€˜Elstarâ€™ and other apple cultivars is urgently needed. This paper reports on two trials made with the thinning agent MaxCel containing 6 -benzyladenine (BA) as the active ingredient. Generally, MaxCel applied at 10 - 12 mm fruit diameter thinned well, yielded bigger fruits and improved return bloom. However, thinning efficacy of MaxCel was negligible for weak growing trees or branches and increased with the vigour of the tree or branch. Adequate thinning and target fruit sizes were obtained with BA-concentrations in between 100 and 300 mg L- 1 active ingredient.

40|$|The {{effects of}} organic versus {{conventional}} crop management practices (fertilisation, crop protection) and preceding crop on potato tuber yield (total, <b>marketable,</b> tuber <b>size</b> grade distribution) and quality (proportion of diseased, green and damaged tubers, tuber macro-nutrient concentrations) parameters were investigated {{over six years}} (2004 â€“ 2009) {{as part of a}} long-term factorial field trial in North East England. Inter-year variability (the effects of weather and preceding crop) was observed to {{have a profound effect on}} yields and quality parameters, and this variability was greater in organic fertility systems. Total and marketable yields were significantly reduced by the use of both organic crop protection and fertility management. However, the yield gap between organic and conventional fertilisation regimes was greater and more variable than that between crop protection practices. This appears to be attributable mainly to lower and less predictable nitrogen supply in organically fertilised crops. Increased incidence of late blight in organic crop protection systems only occurred when conventional fertilisation was applied. In organically fertilised crops yield was significantly higher following grass/red clover leys than winter wheat, but there was no pre-crop effect in conventionally fertilised crops. The results highlight that nitrogen supply from organic fertilisers rather than inefficient pest and disease control may be the major limiting factor for yields in organic potato production systems...|$|R

'D'Anjou' is vigorous and non-precocious; thus, strategies to limit vigor and induce early fruiting are required. In contrast, 'Bartlett' possesses a high fruit-setting efficiency and, consequently, is prone to over-setting fruit. Thus, crop reduction is necessary to achieve <b>marketable</b> fruit <b>size,</b> but hand thinning is time-consuming and costly. Two methods were investigated to resolve these issues: Root pruning of 'd'Anjou' pear trees and, chemical thinning of 'Bartlett' pears using abscisic acid (ABA). Root pruning was imposed on one or both sides of the tree row and compared to an untreated control plot at two sites: Moderate-density, 6 th leaf 'd'Anjou'/OH x F 87; and, high-density, 4 th leaf 'd'Anjou'/OH x F 87. Root pruning two-sides of the tree row consistently reduced shoot growth and the effects were partially dependent on tree age at the time of root pruning. Return bloom was positively affected by root pruning, but fruit weight was often reduced. Reduced fruit weight was not associated with mid-season water or nutrient deficits. Yield and yield efficiency the year following double-sided root pruning were improved with the greatest response occurring in the younger orchard (i. e., 70...|$|R

40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} problems affecting sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) growth and yield in many tropical countries including Highland Papua of Eastern Indonesia, where it is grown as a staple crop under rainfed conditions. Some genotypes survive during drought, while many others fail. This condition regularly devastates sweet potato growth and threatens the lives of highland Papuan people. On the other hand, research into the effects of drought and on the growth, yield, and water relations of sweet potato remains limited. A series of pot and field trials therefore was conducted to identify the drought tolerance of sweet potato cultivars available in Australia. The influence of soil water regimes on the physiology, growth, and yield of sweet potato was studied to determine the critical soil water levels that sweet potato could tolerate and produce acceptable yields. The influence of nutrient supply (N and K) on water use efficiency in sweet potato was also studied. A grafting trial was carried out to examine the nature of the physiological signal between shoot and root in relation to transpiration efficiency and yield responses in sweet potato. The cultivars Lole and Hawaii showed more strongly developed drought resistant characters than all of the other cultivars. They have better water use efficiency, maintain higher plant water status under drought stress by delaying wilting, and lower percentage decrease in leaf water potential indicating their greater tolerance to water stress at the stage of vegetative growth. Field trials were conducted to determine tuber yields from the same 15 sweet potato cultivars under well-watered conditions. The Lole and Hawaii cultivars produced low tuber yields, whereas the Beerwah Gold and Wanmun cultivars produced the greatest yields when not water stressed. The Lole cultivar representing the vegetative tolerant and Wanmun cv representing the susceptible genotypes were grown in a glasshouse to observe the degree to which sweet potato cultivars could withstand water stress conditions and still produce good tuber yields. The Wanmun cultivar, which grew and produced good yields under well-watered conditions, was strongly affected by water stress. On the other hand, the Lole cultivar showed more drought tolerance, indicated by greater plant water status, including leaf water potential and relative water contents.

40|$|Growing {{systems that}} {{recirculate}} the nutrient solution are attractive, because they couple saving {{of water and}} fertilizers with decreased leaching. However, the longer irrigation water is collected and re-used, the higher the concentration of salts. Maintaining the EC of the nutrient solution within (conservative) boundaries requires flushing rates of 30 percent or more, {{in spite of the}} recirculating facilities. In order to determine the processes responsible for the reduction of fresh yield, that is often the consequence of growth under salinity stress, we investigated the effect on production (that is, yield quantity and quality) of a tomato crop, of high EC in combination with two water uptake rates. Associated results about leaf growth are presented in the first paper of this series. Climate in two identical glasshouses was controlled to maintain a constant ratio (65 percent) of potential evaporation, while preserving equal assimilation levels. Half of the rows in each house were given a 2 dS/m treatment in the root medium whereas the other half were given 10 dS/m. Leaf growth, canopy development and fresh and dry yield were traced during a whole spring growing season. Parameters of yield that were measured were: total fresh and <b>marketable</b> yield, fruit <b>size</b> distribution, fruit elasticity, fruit dry matter and sugar content, acidity and salinity. Fresh yield was affected by both treatments as follows: high EC significantly reduced yield, whereas the low transpiration treatment only mitigated the effect of high EC. In particular, in the high transpiration treatment marketable yield was reduced by 30 percent (due both to 25 percent smaller fruits and to 20 percent blossom-end rot, BER), whereas in the low transpiration treatment high EC reduced both size and yield by 15 percent, and incidence of BER was only 2 percent. Dry matter and sugar content were higher in the high EC treatments, so that total dry matter yield was the same everywhere, except the high EC, high transpiration treatment, where BER reduced marketable dry matter by 25 percent. Fruit elasticity (both at harvest and after one week) was not affected by any treatment, if differences in size were accounted for. It is concluded that an appropriate use of available tools for manipulating indoor climate, makes it possible to offset the effect of a high salinity of irrigation water. In particular, it is shown that a grower could accept a decrease in yield if there were a sufficient increment in quality of the product...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{individual}} tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit weight during a crop cycle is of commercial benefit to improve marketable yield. To assess the main causes of variability in tomato fruit size, plant spacing and fruit thinning effects on fruit yield and individual fruit weight down the truss was examined. Three fresh market tomato cultivars, Alboran (Standard), Ophir (Beefsteak) and Cherita (Cherry) were grown, in New Zealand during {{winter and spring}} months of 2001, in a greenhouse with NFT at three plant densities (2. 76, 3. 67 and 4. 59 plant per m 2). Each tomato cultivar was fruit thinned to three different levels (3, 4 and 5 fruit per truss for Alboran; 1, 2 and 3 fruit per truss for Ophir; 4, 8 and 12 fruit per truss for Cherita). Total fruit weight and fruit number were taken at each harvest for all treatments. At the low density (2. 76 plants per m 2) individual fruit weights within each truss were taken for all fruit thinning treatments. A total soluble solid measurement was also taken during an August harvest. Alboran showed a significantly higher final fruit yield per surface area than Ophir and Cherita cultivars, indicating why Alboran is a standard cultivar. No difference in fruit yield or fruit number surface area was observed with both Alboran and Ophir cultivars as plant density increased. This {{was the result of}} flower and / or fruit abortion at the higher densities, due to low solar radiation levels observed under winter and spring conditions in this study. Cherita, although not significant, showed a trend of increasing fruit yield per surface area as plant density increased. The low solar radiation levels did not have as larger effect on flower and / or fruit abortion in Cherita. It had a lower fruit (sink) load and was able to support more fruit development with the low levels of photosynthetic assimilate produced under the low solar radiation levels. Larger mean fruit weights, in all three cultivars, were observed with more fruit thinning due to increased photosynthetic assimilate being available to the remaining fruit. No difference in fruit yield per surface area was observed with both Alboran or Ophir cultivars as more fruit were left on the truss, which was due to the smaller mean fruit weight and a greater proportion of flower and / or fruit abortion caused by the high fruit load with low solar radiation levels. However thinning Cherita to 4 fruit per truss did produce significantly lower yields per surface area compared with 8 and 12 fruit per truss. Individual fruit weight down the truss, of all three cultivars, reduced in size by a constant factor or slope. A slope of - 13 g / fruit position was observed for Alboran, which was flatter than that of Ophir (- 17 g / fruit position) and steeper than that of Cherita (- 0. 15 to - 0. 60 g / fruit position). The number of fruit on the truss did not affect the slope of Alboran and Ophir cultivars, while thinning Cherita to 4 fruit per truss produced a significantly steeper slope (- 0. 60 g / fruit position) than 8 and 12 fruit per truss (0. 25 g / fruit position). More fruit present on a truss produced smaller proximal (first) fruit, thus reducing the size of the remaining fruit on the truss proportionately. Individual trusses within Cherita were also shown to have a constant slope of fruit size down the truss. These results suggest that plant density and fruit thinning can be used to produce more fruit within the desired <b>marketable</b> fruit <b>size</b> range all year round.

Boer goats tend to gain weight {{at about the same}} rate as their sire, so a buck from a proven fast-growing bloodline will command the highest price, as its offspring will tend to also be fast growers. The primary market for slaughter goats is a 22 - 36 kg kid; kids should reach <b>marketable</b> <b>size</b> at weaning age. The kid of a proven fast-growing sire might weigh 36 kg at 90 days, while the kid of a poor-quality sire might weigh only 15 kg at 90 days. An average-quality buck will initially be less expensive to purchase, but it can significantly undermine an operation's long-term profitability.|$|E
40|$|In broad outline {{mariculture}} may {{be classified}} under four major categories, viz., I) culturing {{fish and other}} animals in hatcheries for release with the expectation of increasing commercial catches, 2) capture of young ones and rearing them in confinement to <b>marketable</b> <b>size,</b> 3) raising of the young from eggs obtained from wild parents and their retention and feeding in enclosures until they attain <b>marketable</b> <b>size</b> and 4) hatching of young from eggs obtained from brood stock maintained for the purpose and raising of young in confined enclosures until they reach <b>marketable</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture of Lates calcarifer, {{known as}} seabass, was {{commenced}} in the 1970 s in Thailand, and rapidly spread throughout Southeast Asia. In India also it is a sought after fish in many states. The grow-out phase involves the rearing of the seabass from juvenile to <b>marketable</b> <b>size.</b> <b>Marketable</b> <b>size</b> requirement of seabass vary {{country to country}} e. g. in Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore, the normally accepted <b>marketable</b> <b>size</b> of seabass is between 700 â€“ 1200 g while in the Philippines, <b>marketable</b> <b>size</b> is between 300 â€“ 400 g. The culture period in grow-out phase also vary from 3 â€“ 4 months (to produce 300 â€“ 400) to 8 â€“ 12 months. The success of marine cage culture of seabass and its economical viability have contributed significantly to large scale development of this aquaculture syste...|$|E
40|$|In culturing {{milkfish}} (Chanos chanos) to <b>marketable</b> <b>size,</b> the fry (total length = 12 - 15 mm) {{are usually}} reared first in nursery ponds or pens (hapa nets) until they become fingerlings (total length = 2 cm or more). The fingerlings are {{then transferred to}} the grow-out ponds or pens where they are reared to <b>marketable</b> <b>size.</b> In some countries like the Philippines, fingerling production has become an industry by itself. This paper reviews {{the state of the}} art and constraints to and suggests future research directions for milkfish fingerling production in nursery ponds and pens...|$|E
