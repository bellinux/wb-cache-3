5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{also has}} other powers of general supervision, mainly {{granted by the}} Maastricht Treaty. The Parliament {{has the power to}} set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease or CIA {{detention}} flights—the former {{led to the creation of}} the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.|$|E

5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland cattle in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (<b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland cattle for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{days after}} the deal was {{formally}} signed, MBC’s current affairs program “PD Diary” aired a multi-part episode entitled “U.S. beef, is it safe from <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease?” It was reported by MBC that Koreans carry a gene making them more susceptible to <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease than Americans. This claim has since been retracted by MBC. MBC further devoted 15 out of 25 other news slots to publicizing the issue showing images of downer cows from England and U.S., and reporting information such as claiming that variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) is easily transmittable through methods including blood transfusions, eating instant noodles containing beef products and using cosmetics made with cow-derived collagen.|$|E

25|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), {{commonly known as}} <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease, is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} and fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that may be passed to humans who have eaten infected flesh. BSE causes a spongiform degeneration {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, of 2.5 to 5 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years. BSE is caused by a misfolded protein—a prion. In the United Kingdom, more than 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program. In France, the country worst affected overall, over 300,000 cases were identified, although most were not recorded at the time.|$|E

It was thought that concern over <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).|$|E
