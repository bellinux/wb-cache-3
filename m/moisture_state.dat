40|$|An {{evaluation}} of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and freezing and thawing (F/T) in concrete transportation structures is presented along with mitigation methods for slowing {{the rate of}} deterioration in concrete. A combination of field and laboratory testing confirms ASR deterioration is exacerbated by exposure to F/T. Laboratory testing indicates an aggregate previously deemed inert to ASR, caused ASR deterioration in several concrete pavement and transportation structures. Existing standard test methods deem this aggregate safe for use in concrete. A modified test method shows the concrete can deteriorate rapidly when subjected to cycles of conditions promoting ASR and F/T. Several structures containing this aggregate deteriorated rapidly and severely during exposure to F/T. The interstate pavement underwent less deterioration as the incorporation of some Class C fly ash limited the development of ASR, and improved the durability to F/T. A three-year field test of various treatments applied to concrete barriers indicates silane reduces the <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of the concrete and slows the development of F/T and ASR deterioration as compared to untreated sections. A corresponding three-year {{evaluation of}} silane applied to concrete pavements, indicates silane slows F/T deterioration over time by reducing the <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of the concrete. Measuring the <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of concrete in the field proved difficult. Results of field and laboratory testing indicate measuring vapor pressure may prove more useful for evaluating the efficacy of treatments in reducing the moisture within concrete. The <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of the concrete {{is critical to the}} development of both ASR and F/T, as concretes protected from external moisture did not develop deleterious deterioration while specimens exposed to additional moisture deteriorated. This indicates limiting the ingress of external moisture is a viable method for slowing both ASR and F/T deterioration in concrete...|$|E

Concrete mixes were prepared with natural and recycled aggregates at different proportions. The <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of the aggregates were controlled at air-dried (AD), oven-dried (OD) and saturated surface-dried (SSD) states prior to use. The ratio of cement to free water was kept constant {{for all of the}} mixes. At the fresh state, the slump loss for various concrete mixtures was determined, while the compressive strength was determined after curing for 3, 7 and 28 days. The test results showed that the initial slump values of the concrete mixtures were dependent on the initial free water contents, and the slump loss values of the mixtures were related to the <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of the aggregates. Slump loss was significant when 100 % AD or OD recycled aggregate was used. The effect of the <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of the aggregates on the strength of the concretes prepared with OD and SSD state aggregates at early age (i. e., 3 and 7 days) was noticeable. The concrete prepared with the AD aggregates achieved the highest average strength values at 3, 7 and 28 days. However, at 28 days, the concrete strengths prepared with different types of aggregates were similar. The results suggested that an AD aggregate that contains not more than 50 % recycled aggregate is optimum for producing normal strength recycled aggregate concrete.

We perform three experiments, each consisting of 128 independent warm-season monthly forecasts: 1) an experiment in which both soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> and carbon states (e. g., those determining leaf area index) are initialized realistically, 2) an experiment in which the carbon states are prescribed to climatology throughout the forecasts, and 3) an experiment in which both the carbon and soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> are prescribed to climatology throughout the forecasts. Evaluating the monthly forecasts of air temperature in each ensemble against observations, as well as quantifying the inherent predictability of temperature within each ensemble, shows that dynamic phenology can indeed contribute positively to subseasonal forecasts, though only to a small extent, with an impact dwarfed by that of soil moisture...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{consists}} of three areas, namely modelling of- (1) temperature, (2) <b>moisture</b> <b>state,</b> and (3) stresses in young concrete. The derivation of models, examination of material data, and development of computer programs have progressed differently in these areas. The first area, modelling of temperatures, is the most comprehensive and complete, since it has been researched more extensively than the other areas. On the other hand, the way of modelling stresses {{in this study is}} purely theoretical and has not been tested against empirical data, but gives some guidelines for future applications. Finally, the modelling of <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> is somewhere in between the other two areas. The results can be applied to different fields of concreting, such as estimation of form stripping times, estimation of necessary measures to be taken in winter concreting, study of drying shrinkage cracking, and study of stresses due to varying temperatures in early age concretes. The aim of this report is not to discuss applications, but to give the background and material data used in the models for calculating the temperature, <b>moisture</b> <b>state,</b> and stresses in young concrete. It is shown that temperature can be modelled to within an accuracy of 1 to 2 °C which is acceptable for most applications. However, it is essential to have good knowledge of both material data and environmental conditions. For the study of moisture states, a consistent model for the description of desorption and absorption isotherms has been developed. The treatment of both desorption and absorption isotherms in the same theoretical framework makes it possible to introduce scanning curves between these limit curves for subsequent drying and wetting. The effects of alkali have been modelled as an alkali equilibrium isotherm estimated from the known amounts of sodium and potassium oxides in the cement. The alkali influenced curve can be combined with any description of the isotherms with respect to the physically bound water. The need for considering the effects of alkali for higher humidities has been shown in moisture calculations. Godkänd; 1994; 20070426 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a new {{theoretical}} {{mechanism is}} presented in which equatorial Rossby and inertio-gravity wave modes may {{interact with each other}} through resonance with the diurnal cycle of tropical deep convection. We have adopted the two-layer incompressible equatorial primitive equations forced by a parametric heating that roughly represents deep convection activity in the tropical atmosphere. The heat source was parametrized in the simplest way according to the hypothesis that it is proportional to the lower-troposphere moisture convergence, with the background <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> function mimicking the structure of the ITCZ. In this context, we have investigated the possibility of resonant interaction between equatorially trapped Rossby and inertio-gravity modes through the diurnal cycle of the background <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> function. The reduced dynamics of a single resonant duo shows that when this diurnal variation is considered, a Rossby wave mode can undergo significant amplitude modulations when interacting with an inertio-gravity wave mode, which is not possible {{in the context of the}} resonant triad non-linear interaction. Therefore, the results suggest that the diurnal variation of the ITCZ can be a possible dynamical mechanism that leads the Rossby waves to be significantly affected by high frequency modes.

40|$|As {{interest}} in sustainable {{materials such as}} recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) rises, effort, {{it is important to}} understand the properties of RAC that relates to its use in construction. To respond to this need, various tests were performed to investigate the properties of RAC. Properties of RAC are highly affected by processing. Processing variables indeed in this study are two-stage mixing approach (TSMA) and control of RAC initial moisture contents. By two-stage mixing approach, the compressive strength of RAC improved with different initial <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of recycled coarse aggregates. However, in case of shrinkage, some previous studies showed that RCA can absorb larger amount of water than natural aggregates because RCA has a higher porosity which leads concrete to increase shrinkage. To make a balance strength with shrinkage, our tests were performed by various mixture batches. In addition, ring and dog bone tests were studied when the specimen is restrained and is affected by internal tensile stress. With using 74 % initial <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of recycled coarse aggregates, the compressive strength was similar to that of normal concrete and the drying shrinkage was less. Furthermore, test with using recycled fine aggregates(RFA) was performed and fly ash was used to reduce shrinkage of RAC.

40|$|Green-roof thermal and {{hydrological}} {{performance has}} been extensively studied, but the specific effect of substrate moisture has received little attention. This study investigates the substrate moisture effect on evapotranspiration (ET), water balance and subaerial and subsurface temperatures of an extensive tropical green roof. Firstly, three weather types (sunny, cloudy and rainy) in conjunction with three substrate <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> (wet, moist and dry) generate nine permutations for a scenario analysis. Secondly, the correlation analysis explores the relationship between substrate moisture and thermal performance indicators. The major finding is that substrate moisture is effective in regulating substrate thermal behavior, but less so in enhancing ET and associated cooling. Substrate moisture can notably cool the soil, rockwool and concrete tile on sunny days, and warm them on cloudy and rainy days. In contrast, substrate moisture has limited effect on ET, which is largely dependent on solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed. The dry substrate on sunny day demonstrates an aberrant behavior of high ET which contradicts with previous studies. This unusual phenomenon is explained by the limited substrate mass effect of the thin extensive green roof. The vegetation surface and air temperatures show little variations between different soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states,</b> and their correlations with substrate moisture are insignificant. The findings could provide an additional substrate moisture dimension to enhance the design and management of green roofs with reference to water and thermal behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the temporal}} variations of land and atmospheric states during the onset (September) through to the peak (February) of the wet season over northern Australia is statistically diagnosed using ensembles of offline land surface model simulations that produce a range of different background soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states.</b> We derive the temporal correspondence between variations in the soil moisture and the planetary boundary layer via a statistical measure of rank correlation. The simulated evaporative fraction and the boundary layer are shown to be strongly correlated during both SON (September–October–November) and DJF (December–January–February) despite the differing background soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> between the two seasons and among the ensemble members. The sign and magnitude of the boundary layer–surface layer soil moisture association during {{the onset of the}} wet season (SON) differs from the correlation between the evaporative fraction and boundary layer from the same season, and from the correlation between the surface soil moisture and boundary layer association during DJF. The patterns and magnitude of the surface flux–boundary layer correspondence are not captured when the relationship is diagnosed using the surface layer soil moisture alone. The conflicting results arise because the surface layer soil moisture lacks strong correlation with the atmosphere during the monsoon onset because the evapotranspiration is dominated by transpiration. Our results indicate that accurately diagnosing the correspondence and therefore coupling strength in seasonally dry regions, such as northern Australia, requires root zone soil moisture to be included...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the interaction between belowground and aboveground ecohydrologic dynamics as facilitated by hydraulic redistribution. We analyze the partitioning of moisture and energy between tall and understory vegetation, and soil evaporation. Both the competitive and facilitative dependencies are examined using a shared resource model where the soil serves as a common reservoir for the interaction between the different vegetation species. The <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of the reservoir is altered by the addition and withdrawal by vegetation roots in conjunction with soil-moisture transport. Vertical patterns of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> and uptake reflect the nonlinear interactions between vegetation species. The study is performed using data from the Blodgett Forest Ameriflux site in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The Mediterranean climate of the region, with wet winters and long dry summers, offers an ideal environment for the study. The results indicate that deep layer uptake of water by the tall vegetation and its release in the shallow layers enhances the productivity of the understory vegetation during the summer. The presence of understory vegetation reduces direct soil-evaporative loss making more moisture available for vegetation which enhances the total ecosystem productivity. The litter layer is also found to play an important role in the partitioning of the water and energy fluxes by damping the radiation reaching the soil and thereby reducing water loss due to soil evaporation...|$|E

Indirect tensile stress tests were carried out to evaluate stripping behaviour. The mixtures tested were fabricated with 0, 20, 40 and 60 % recycled aggregates. Two types of natural aggregates were used: schist and calcite dolomite. An increase in the percentage of recycled aggregates was found to produce a decrease in the tensile stress ratio of the hot asphalt mixtures. To study this phenomenon, two and three factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed with indirect tensile stress being used as the dependent variable. The factors studied were the percentage of recycled aggregates (0, 20, 40 and 60 %), the <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> (dry, wet) and the type of natural aggregate (schist, calcite). On the basis of the ANOVA results, {{it was found that the}} most important factor affecting resistance was the <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> (dry, wet) of the specimens. The percentage of recycled aggregate also affected indirect tensile stress, especially in the dry state. The type of natural aggregate did not have a significant effect on indirect tensile stress. The hot asphalt mixture specimens made with different percentages of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition debris and of natural quarry aggregates showed poor stripping behaviour. This stripping behaviour can be related to both the poor adhesion of the recycled aggregates and the high absorption of the mortar of cement adhered to them...|$|E

It also introduces a new method to measure specific soil <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> such as {{permanent wilting point}} and field capacity using the shrinkage curve. The model considers the soil fabric as a non-rigid, aggregated and unsaturated soil water medium. Its functional parameters (defined as pedohydral parameters) are the independent parameters of the shrinkage curve, which defines two major aspects {{of the structure of}} the fabric: (i) the volumetric functional elements of the soil fabric, and (ii) the arrangement of solid, water and air as functions of water content. Two African tropical soils were characterized and analysed according to a structural model with parameters of their shrinkage curve. The parameters of four soil horizons for the two soil types were determined continuously along their shrinkage curves. They were then used as descriptive variables representing the soil’s hydrostructural behaviour in a canonical variate analysis, the results of which showed the A horizons to be distinct from the lower horizons, which appear as continua down the profiles. Analysis of the results reveals the importance of the clay and of the iron/clay ratio in the hydrostructural properties of the two soils. Transitional points of the shrinkage curve matched well some particular <b>moisture</b> <b>states</b> of the water potential curve, such as wilting points and field capacities.

40|$|High soil {{saturation}} {{levels can}} be considered as a primary indicator for potential river flooding. Therefore it is advisable to visualize real-time soil moisture information in flood forecasting or warning systems. Monitoring of soil moisture, however, is not an easy task due to its variable nature in time, space and depth. This paper presents and compares methods to assess the severity of the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of hydrological catchments considered in a typical operational flood forecasting system. The severity of the relative soil <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> is obtained and mapped by comparing simulation results of a lumped conceptual hydrological model, directly, by making use of the soil moisture component of the model or indirectly considering the baseflow component. The values are compared in real time after with the results of a long term simulation. Another approach uses rainfall, evapotranspiration and the river flow observations. By applying a baseflow filter to the river flow observations and an advanced method for empirical catchment water balance computation, two additional soil moisture indicators can be definied, namely the filtered baseflow and the water balance based relative soil moisture content. It is shown that each of the methods allow to obtain useful estimates of the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>state</b> of a catchment in real time. Secondly, a method has been set up to calculate the exceedance probability of a predefined discharge threshold, e. g. flood threshold, at the outlet or a given location in the catchment. The exceedance probability is calculated by a logit relation with the soil moisture indicator. The different soil moisture indicators are compared in their predicting capabilities by calculating and comparing the probability of detection, the false alarm rate and the critical success index. Interestingly, the application of such logit relation or the use of a simple water balance computation for the catchment, based on real-time rainfall, evapotranspiration and river flow observations, leads to more reliable exceedance probability estimates than the common direct use of total runoff results from a state-of-the art rainfall-runoff model. Mapping the exceedance probability for the different hydrological catchments together with the width of the confidence interval on this probability is proposed as a useful tool to increase the preparedness for potential floods, since this kind of maps provide a quick overview of the catchments in which flood problems can be expected, hence on which flood crisis management bodies have to focus their attention. status: publishe...|$|E
