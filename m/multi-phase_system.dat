5000|$|In IT systems, {{a single}} {{insulation}} fault {{is unlikely to}} cause dangerous currents to flow through a human body in contact with earth, because no low-impedance circuit exists for such a current to flow. However, a first insulation fault can effectively turn an IT system into a TN system, and then a second insulation fault can lead to dangerous body currents. Worse, in a <b>multi-phase</b> <b>system,</b> {{if one of the}} line conductors made contact with earth, it would cause the other phase cores to rise to the phase-phase voltage relative to earth rather than the phase-neutral voltage. IT systems also experience larger transient overvoltages than other systems.|$|E
5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced <b>multi-phase</b> <b>system,</b> the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|E

40|$|The aimed {{properties}} of the interpolation functions used in quantitative phase-field models for two-phase systems do not extend to <b>multi-phase</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, {{a new type of}} interpolation functions is introduced that has a zero slope at the equilibrium values of the non-conserved field variables representing the different phases and allows for a thermodynamically consistent interpolation of the free energies. The interpolation functions are applicable for multi-phase-field and multi-order-parameter representations and can be combined with existing quantitative approaches for alloys. A model for polycrystalline, multi-component and <b>multi-phase</b> <b>systems</b> is formulated using the new interpolation functions that accounts in a straightforward way for composition-dependent expressions of the bulk Gibbs energies and diffusion mobilities, and interfacial free energies and mobilities.

The AC OPF problem is known to be nonconvex (and, in fact, NP-hard). Convex relaxation techniques have been recently explored to solve the OPF task with reduced computational burden; however, sufficient conditions for tightness of these relaxations are only available for restricted classes of system topologies and problem setups. Identifying feasible power-flow solutions remains hard in more general problem formulations, especially in unbalanced <b>multi-phase</b> <b>systems</b> with renewables.

The characterisation of surfactant mesophases in <b>multi-phase</b> <b>systems</b> can be observed by methods involving: polarising optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and use of surfactant-specific electrodes to measure conductivity (mV). Investigating ternary systems composed of surfactant: co-surfactant components led {{to the understanding of}} the behaviour surfactants exhibit, as they exist in different mesophases. The application of the surfactant ion-specific coated-wire electrode (CWE) to ternary system mixtures presenting liquid crystals of different morphological behaviour (i. e. mesophases), allowed to determine and distinguish between the differing properties of these mesophases in terms of monitoring free surfactant monomer levels. The CWE was applied to surfactant mixtures in the hope of determining important information, for example; observing Nernstian behaviour, monitoring the onset of aggregation, i. e. the CMC or more complex aggregates like the hexagonal or lamellar phase, along with the free surfactant monomer levels present in the latter part of these concentrated mixtures. Whilst also investigating the occurrence of phase transitions between different liquid crystal mesophases and how their effects on the CWE could be explained in terms of electrochemical response or free monomer concentrations. Further modelling allowed for the determination of the interaction behaviour between a surfactant and co-surfactant within a ternary system. To conclude, the limitations of the CWE were determined, along with propositions for future development of drug-selective electrodes, which may be applied in the research for investigating the chemical behaviour of drug systems in solution.
