40|$|The {{construction}} of the urban transport line network {{is one of the}} fundamental problems in the traffic practice. Efficient functioning of the <b>public</b> <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> supported from the public sources in the towns is more urgent at present, when the individual automobile traffic leads to congestions in central parts of the cities. The demand to increase the culture of travelling in the <b>public</b> <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> requir es, however, subst antial costs. Therefore it is necessary to solve the balance between the inhabitants ́ requirements and the economy of the transportation system. The operation of the <b>public</b> <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> must be rational; the vehicles must not show unreasonable waiting times, etc. One of the possible ways how to rationalise the <b>public</b> <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> is to minimise the number of vehicles in operation complying with the requirements of the travellers. The paper deals with the problem of minimising the number of vehicles needed to operate the lines of the <b>public</b> <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> network. To solve this problem the methods of linear programming are used. There are four mathematical models described in which the vehicles are assigned to the individual lines. The models arise from the mathematical model PRIVOL [4], and they vary from this model especially by the variety of the rolling-stock the transport company has at disposal. By means of the constructed models a number of numerical experiments concerning the ne- twork corresponding to a medium-sized town were performed using the four constructed models. These numerical experiments demonstrated the functionality of the designed models. The main contribution of the presented modifications of the original model PRIVOL consists in the fact, that instead of the optimal number of seats the new models are able to directly find an optimal number of vehicles needed to operate the particular lines to meet the expected demand of the passengers. That way the proposed approach allows to objectify the decision making of the transport company concerning the allocation of vehicles to the network lines...|$|R

This paper explores suburbanization and sprawling effect of commuter rail transit on the rural exurbia of the Tel Aviv metropolis by analyzing its effect on residential location decisions. The findings indicate that the suburban rail system was a determinant factor in the location choice of households which migrated from the inner parts of the Tel Aviv metropolis, since it allowed them to maintain strong commuting connections to their residential origin. This suggests that rail transit, along with its potential to strengthen the inner cities, also accelerates suburbanization and counter urbanization.

40|$|Abstract. Mass Transit is the {{transportation}} for tomorrow. Mass transit {{is able to}} commute {{a large amount of}} people in {{a certain period of time}} with a pre-designed controlled speed. This paper intent to pervail the importance of mass transit as the only earth- and user- friendly public transport, as well as the most important urban tourist transport in the near future. Ideally, the tourist should be able to visit all destinations within a city with mass transit which integrated with walking and cycling to create a wonderful travel experience. What is Mass Transit? Mass transit, also called <b>mass</b> <b>transportation,</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> or <b>public</b> transit, is the movement of people within urban areas using group travel technologies such as buses and trains [1]. This make it possible to move people in the same travel corridor with greater efficiency which can lead to lower costs to carry each person (because the costs are shared by many people), the opportunity to spend more money to provide better service. <b>Public</b> <b>transportation</b> system is defined as transportation operating along a fixed route according to an established schedule for a single fare [2]. According to TSA. org [3], mass transportation modes include: ▪ Inter-city buses, ▪ Trolley buses, ▪ Subway & commuter rail, ▪ Heavy and light rail, ▪ Automated guide way transit...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this chapter is to assess the relationship between urban form, mobility behavior, and dysfunction of transport supply in a large African city with high urban growth like Yaoundé in Cameroon. Specifically, the chapter aims at assessing the influence of urban, mobility, and socioeconomic characteristics of an origin area on the mobility choice of individuals. Using field data collected by the urban community of Yaoundé in 2010 and statistical tools such as multinomial logits, results show that urban form characteristics, such as human and establishment densities, accessibility, and origin-destination distances influence the choices of individual mobility. The urban form of major cities in Africa, due to a very high urban growth uncontrolled by the local authorities, plays a negative role on the operations of urban transport service in Africa because it promotes an artisanal supply characterized by a low capacity and reduces the efficiency and competitiveness of <b>mass</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation,</b> which is cheaper. Based on results of this study, recommendations are: controlling urban sprawl, easing of accessibility to public transport, and developing an efficient and competitive mass transportation...|$|E

40|$|Today {{urban areas}} {{are faced with}} {{problems}} like traffic congestion, air pollution, and limited accessibility and transport policy issues {{are focused on the}} "sustainable city of the future". For decision-makers the crucial question is how, with limited financial resources, a system for <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> should be designed and developed to provide attractive travel and transport services. The basic problem is related to the systems design process itself, as the introduction of advanced applications based on new information and communication technologies will require a better understanding of <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> in a systems perspective. By combining cognitive systems engineering and transportation systems analysis, relevant elements of control and communication theories (cybernetics) and human factors, a conceptual model and an analytical framework for <b>public</b> (<b>mass</b> passenger) <b>transportation</b> are developed. By use of a means-ends hierarchy of functional levels, the model describes five dynamic processes (the accessibility, travel, transport, traffic, and motion processes) in <b>public</b> <b>transportation.</b> Structural elements of the model (nodes for control functions, information collection and processing, and links for data and information flows) and their characteristics are identified and discussed. The framework and the model are, for validation purposes, applied in a design task (the realisation of an information centre for travellers and passengers) and in an evaluation task (an exploration and analysis of how incidents and disturbances are handled in Gothenburg). The complexity of <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> is further explored, and control and data filtering needs on each functional level are identified and related to the potential of future dynamic interaction between actors on different functional levels. It is finally stated that the systems approach used to develop the model and the framework will become a necessary basis for future new ideas of how to promote the transportation of people by public means and, in that respect, the concept of intermodal passenger transport is critically assessed. The potential of the conceptual model and the analytical framework, to incorporate all possible means of transport (public and private) as well as to apply to the transportation of goods, is also discussed...|$|R

Through a case study of Detroit, the dissertation argues that World War II reinforced a culture of driving and set the stage for <b>mass</b> abandonment of <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> in the post-war era. Even as wartime resource shortages exposed the vulnerabilities of car-centered societies, riders??? experiences on public transit and whites??? increasingly strong associations of streetcars and buses with black bodies worked against efforts to create long-term alternatives to private car use. Understanding the significance of World War II in shaping Americans??? mobility requires exploration of wartime transformations in everyday travel, as well as how government agencies and private corporations depicted these changes. The first part of this dissertation explores the effects of wartime resource shortages on Detroit???s public transit system. As buses and streetcars became extremely overcrowded, and service unreliable, racial tensions on board mounted. Public transit vehicles became common sites of racial conflicts. The second part of the dissertation examines automobility in the war and immediate postwar era. Government propaganda and private advertisements portrayed driving as fundamental to the American way of life and upheld the white male driver as a symbol of freedom for which the United States was fighting. At the same time, federal programs to limit rubber and gasoline use promoted driving as patriotic and essential to the war effort...|$|R
