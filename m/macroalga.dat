40|$|Herbivory is a {{fundamental}} process determining reef resilience, and while algal farming damselfishes can help shape benthic assemblages, an understanding of their contribution to areas outside of defended territories is relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate how the farming damselfish Stegastes marginatus plays a dual role in benthic structuring by 1) contributing to persistence of the invasive <b>macroalga</b> Acanthophora spicifera within a Hawaiian marine protected area, where the <b>macroalga</b> occurred exclusively inside Stegastes territories, and 2) behaving as an opportunistic browser of the exotic alga outside their territorial borders. Greater than 50 % of the biomass of tethered A. spicifera was consumed within one-hour when placed outside Stegastes territories, compared to < 5 % lost from tethers within territories or herbivore exclusion cages. In situ remote video revealed that tethered A. spicifera located outside territories was grazed primarily by the surgeonfish Acanthurus nigrofuscus (∼ 68 % of total bites) and, surprisingly, by S. marginatus (∼ 27 % of total bites) that left their territories to feed on this resource on 107 occasions during 400 min of filming. Further, for over half of those occurrences where S. marginatus grazed on the tethered <b>macroalga</b> outside of territories, they fed alongside conspecifics and other species, displaying little of the aggressiveness that characterizes this damselfish. These results show that S. marginatus plays a wider role in determining benthic assemblages than previously recognized, acting both as cultivators of a canopy-forming invasive <b>macroalga</b> within their territories, and as opportunistic browsers in neighboring sites. Consequently, S. marginatus can affect benthic species composition across their territory borders.

Our experiment used an incomplete factorial design made up of two factors, each with two levels: (1) light (ambient vs. dark) and (2) <b>macroalgae</b> (presence vs. absence of live <b>macroalgae).</b> Over the course of the 42 -day experiment, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) increased under ambient light by 173 &pm; 14 and 141 &pm; 7 %, respectively, compared to in the dark (78 &pm; 29 and 39 &pm; 22 %). THAA comprised a substantial fraction of SOM (&sim; 16 % of TOC, 35 % of TN) and followed TOC and TN accumulation patterns. Mole percent composition of the THAA pool indicated that SOM was composed of more labile organic material (e. g.

Padina sp., a foliose brown <b>macroalga</b> closely related to L. variegata, reduced coral settlement by 30 % compared with substratum controls. The demonstration of waterborne effects suggests that macroalgae can influence coral settlement before larvae reach reef substrata, even on a crustose coralline alga known to induce settlement, and even where the immediate settlement location is free of macroalgal cover. These results demonstrate the complexity in the mechanisms underlying the effects that over-abundant macroalgal growth may have on reef recovery. These effects have critical implications for the ecological resilience of coral reefs, especially as climate change increases the frequency and severity of disturbances to reefs...|$|E
40|$|In the Lesina Lagoon (southern Italy), {{three species}} of {{crustacean}} mesograzers - the isopods Idotea baltica Pallas and Sphaeroma serratum Fabricius, and the amphipod Gammarus us insensibilis Stock - dominate the epifaunal assemblage {{associated with the}} Rhodophyta Gracilaria verrucosa (Hudson) Papenfuss. We examined in laboratory feeding assays the palatability of the red <b>macroalga</b> {{to each of the}} three mesograzer species. Furthermore, we used a cage experiment to investigate the actual impact of the mesograzer assemblage on the growth of Gracilaria under field conditions. Cages with different mesh sizes were used to test the hypothesis that mesograzer effect on the <b>macroalga</b> is size dependent. Laboratory assays indicated for all the mesograzer species a negative effect on Gracilaria; in particular, I. baltica and G. insensibilis actively consumed the <b>macroalga,</b> whereas S. serratum grazing activity was weaker but nonetheless statistically significant. In contrast, Gracilaria was not significantly grazed under field conditions. When mesograzers were totally excluded, algal growth showed a strong negative variation compared to controls where access was not precluded (ca. 43 %. reduction in wet mass). Simultaneously, the abundance of the encrusting bryozoan Conopeum seurati increased significantly (from 1. 5 to 24. 7 mg g(- 1), corresponding to 1. 7 % and 28. 9 % cover of algal surface); an analogous increase was detected in the abundance of other sessile macrofauna (i. e. the bivalve Mytilaster marioni). When only juvenile, small-sized epifauna were given access to Gracilaria, algal mass change was reduced by around 36 %. The abundance of both encrusting bryozoans and sessile bivalves showed significant positive variations, close to those observed in the total exclusion treatment. Our results suggest that, even though Gracilaria represents a potentially palatable resource for mesograzers in the Lesina Lagoon, the actual impact of epifauna on the <b>macroalga</b> might be beneficial, through an indirect control on the development of fouling epibionts. In addition, such a positive effect may be size specific, since the juvenile, small-sized component of the mesograzer assemblage exerted a significantly weaker control on fouling development, even at unnaturally high densities. We suggest that the occurrence of different functional roles among mesograzer size classes might represent a significant controlling factor for the establishment of mesograzer-epibiont-host plant interactions, and for their effects on macrophytal productivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Conservation {{of habitat}} for {{flagship}} species, such as birds, {{aids in the}} protection of biodiversity in critical ecosystems. Extensive mats of <b>macroalgae</b> stimulated by nu-trient input to estuaries threaten critical successes in conser-vation made by legislation that reduces habitat destruction. <b>Macroalgae</b> can cover intertidal mudflats that are key foraging grounds for obligate visual foragers such as black-bellied plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), as well as foragers that rou-tinely switch from visual to tactile foraging such as least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla), western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), and willets (Tringa semipalmata), and predominately tactile foragers such as marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa). We hypothesized that <b>macroalgae</b> would affect shorebirds directly by altering foraging behavior and indirectly by reducing prey availability. Mats reduced visual foraging (pecking) for sand-pipers and marbled godwits and caused them to probe more often. Willets spent overall less time foraging than sandpipers and marbled godwits and did not alter their foraging strategy due to <b>macroalgae.</b> While foraging, black-bellied plovers, marbled godwits, and willets avoided <b>macroalgae</b> while sand-pipers did not select between habitat types. This suggests <b>macroalgae</b> may have negative effects on plovers, marbled godwits, and willets by reducing foraging area but that sand-pipers may utilize both <b>macroalgae</b> and bare sediments. Macroalgal mats indirectly influenced shorebirds by enhanc-ing variability in prey availability across the mudflat land-scape. By quantifying avoidance of or preference for mats, foraging behavior, and variation in prey availability, we showed that <b>macroalgae</b> have differential effects across shore-bird foraging guilds...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} grazing systems across northern Australia support approximately 50 % {{of the national}} beef herd. Livestock productivity is affected by seasonal variation in pasture quality and quantity. Intensifying livestock production in the north is a challenge, but has been recognised as priority for the Australian economy. <b>Macroalgae</b> offer a sustainable and novel dietary supplement for cattle due to its high nutrient value and biomass production, which are generally superior to forages used in ruminant production systems. This paper highlights some of the existing literature {{associated with the use}} of <b>macroalgae</b> for beef cattle and discusses the potential of green freshwater (Cladophora vagabunda, Oedogonium sp., Spirogyra sp.) and marine <b>macroalgae</b> (Cladophora coelothrix, Derbesia tenuissima, Ulva ohnoi) as feed supplements in northern Australian livestock production systems. Crude protein content of the six species of green <b>macroalgae</b> discussed here ranged from 75. 4 to 339. 1 g kg− 1 dry weight (DW). Dietary mineral limitations in northern livestock production systems include phosphorous (P), sulfur (S) and nitrogen. Four of the six <b>macroalgae</b> species had high P content, ranging from 1. 4 to 5 g kg− 1 DW. Sulfur varied between species, ranging from 2. 9 to 57. 5 g kg− 1 DW, with marine <b>macroalgae</b> having a higher sulfur concentration than freshwater <b>macroalgae.</b> This review demonstrates that green <b>macroalgae</b> have considerable potential to supply a high-protein, high-phosphorous feed supplement for northern livestock production systems dependent on extensive unimproved pastures...|$|R
40|$|Annual {{rates of}} {{sediment}} denitrification and sediment–water fluxes of oxygen and nutrients were quantified at two shallow locations, Virksund and Ulbjerg, in the Limfjorden, Denmark. The sediment was sandy and colonized mainly by bivalves {{with a wet}} weight of 2, 508 g m � 2 at Virksund and 572 g m � 2 at Ulbjerg. A benthic microalgal community was present throughout the year, and for 1 – 2 months in the summer, floating <b>macroalgae</b> partly covered the sediment. Annual budgets for the sediment both including and excluding the activity of <b>macroalgae</b> were calculated. In the absence of <b>macroalgae,</b> the benthic primary production was highest at Ulbjerg, which was autotrophic on an annual basis, whereas Virksund was heterotrophic. When <b>macroalgae</b> were included, both sites were strongly autotrophic on an annual basis. From 13 % to 58 % of the NH 4 produced by mineralization was retained in the sediment {{in the absence of}} <b>macroalgae,</b> primarily because of the assimilation of NH 4 by the microphytobenthic community. Only 25 % and 38 % of the total NO 3 uptake at Ulbjerg and Virksund, respectively, was denitrified in the absence of <b>macroalgae,</b> whereas in the presence of <b>macroalgae,</b> 12 % and 39 % of the NO...|$|R
