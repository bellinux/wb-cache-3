40|$|Gas turbine {{operating}} state determination {{consists of the}} assessment of the modification, due to deterioration and fault, of performance and geometric data characterizing machine components. One of the main effects of deterioration and fault is the modification of compressor and turbine performance maps. In this paper, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a multistage axial compressor are carried out. As a case study, the axial sections (i. e. the first six stages) of the Allison 250 -C 18 axial-centrifugal compressor are considered for the numerical investigation. Simulations are performed by means of a commercial computational fluid dynamic code. A multistage numerical model is set up and validated against the experimental data, gathered from an in-house test rig. Computed performance maps and main flow field features show fairly good agreement with the experimental data. The model is then used to cross-validate the results of zero-dimensional stage-stacking procedures and the stage maps obtained by means of a multistage CFD calculation (i. e. to evaluate the mutual consistency of the two methods for the generation of <b>multistage</b> <b>compressor</b> maps).

40|$|The useful {{operating}} {{range of the}} <b>multistage,</b> axial-flow <b>compressor</b> component of a gas turbine engine limits the extent of operation of that engine. Generally, the compressor stalls or surges at low flow rates and chokes at high flow rates. Thus, any improvement in the range between these compressor aerodynamic limits is normally of benefit to the engine also. An idea for delaying the onset of rotating stall in a <b>multistage,</b> axial-flow <b>compressor</b> which involved circumferentially varying the blade setting angles of stationary blades upstream of the compressor rotors was investigated. Tests involving two low-speed, <b>multistage,</b> axial-flow <b>compressors</b> and an intermediate-speed, three-stage, axial-flow compressor were completed. Comparisons between baseline compressor (circumferentially uniform setting angles) and modified compressor (circumferentially varying setting angles) performance data were made. A variety of blade setting angle circumferential variation patterns were tested. Test results suggest that rotating stall onset in the low-speed compressors could be delayed slightly but consistently with circumferentially varying setting angles. The low-speed compressor results indicated that a small improvement in stall recovery was also possible.

Total pressure and solidities at the rotor trailing edges, and flow angles and solidities at the stator trailing edges are considered as design parameters.

40|$|At the NASA Lewis Research Center, a {{comprehensive}} assessment {{was made of}} the predictive capability of the average passage flow model as applied to <b>multistage</b> axial-flow <b>compressors.</b> This model, which describes the time-averaged flow field within a typical passage of a blade row embedded in a multistage configuration, is being widely used throughout U. S. aircraft industry {{as an integral part of}} their design systems. Rotor flow-angle deviation. In this work, detailed data taken within a four and one-half stage large low-speed compressor were used to assess the weaknesses and strengths of the predictive capabilities of the average passage flow model. The low-speed compressor blading is of modern design and employs stator end-bends. Measurements were made with slow- and high response instrumentation. The high-response measurements revealed the velocity components of both the rotor and stator wakes. From the measured wake profiles, we found that the flow exiting the rotors deviated from the rotor exit metal angle to a lesser degree than was predicted by the average passage flow model. This was found to be due to blade boundary layer transition, which recently has been shown to exist on <b>multistage</b> axial <b>compressor</b> rotor and stator blades, but was not accounted for in the average passage model. Consequently, a model that mimics the effects of blade boundary layer transition, Shih k-epsilon model, was incorporated into the average passage model.

40|$|Very {{low flow}} {{coefficient}} centrifugal compressors are often applied {{as the last}} stages of <b>multistage</b> <b>compressors.</b> Due to the lower volume flow rate, the flow channels in the impeller and diffuser are so narrow that friction loss becomes the main factor, which leads to lower efficiency than that of other stages in the same compressors.

30|$|Transfer {{of ammonia}} to tank B can be {{accomplished}} by various methods; however, the best option when using the present system will be to feed compressed and liquefied ammonia from the <b>multistage</b> <b>compressor.</b> In this method, because of the ammonia gas in the filled tank, the ammonia concentration in the empty tank is brought to 100  %, and then, some part of vaporized ammonia in the filled tank is compressed by the compressor; thus, liquefied ammonia is sent by the compressor discharge line to the filled tank.
