CONCLUSION In this correspondence, {{a general}} design for allpass {{variable}} frac-tional delay (VFD) digital filters with minimum weighted integral squared error {{subject to a}} constraint on <b>maximum</b> error <b>deviation</b> from the desired response was formulated. Design examples show that a trade-off can be achieved between the integral squared error and the <b>maximum</b> error <b>deviation</b> for the allpass VFD filters. From the WLS solution, the <b>maximum</b> error <b>deviation</b> can be reduced while maintaining approximately the same integral squared error.

In general, unfortunately, such a dependency is inevitable: take for example a diagonal random sign matrix of dimension d. The operator norm of the sum of t independent samples is precisely the <b>maximum</b> <b>deviation</b> among d independent random walks of length t. In order to achieve a fixed bound on the <b>maximum</b> <b>deviation</b> with constant probability, {{it is easy to see}} that t should grow logarithmically with d in this scenario.|$|E
