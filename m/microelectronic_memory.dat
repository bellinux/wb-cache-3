40|$|Variability in {{the methods}} and models used for single event upset {{calculations}} in <b>microelectronic</b> <b>memory</b> devices {{can lead to a}} range of possible upset rates. Using heavy ion and proton data for selected DRAM and SRAM memories, we have calculated an array of upset rates in order to compare the Adams worst case interplanetary solar flare model to a model proposed by scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition, methods of upset rate calculation are compared: the Cosmic Ray Effects on Microelectronics CREME code and a Monte Carlo algorithm developed at the Applied Physics Laboratory. The results show that use of a more realistic, although still conservative, model of the space environment can have significant cost saving benefits...|$|E
40|$|This focused issue {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} comprehensive introduction into the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Apart from the brief overview below, it features five review articles. The intention is to cover in a coherent and complementary way key physical aspects of the antiferromagnetic spintronics research. These range from <b>microelectronic</b> <b>memory</b> devices and optical manipulation and detection of antiferromagnetic spins, to the fundamentals of antiferromagnetic dynamics in uniform or spin-textured systems, and to the interplay of antiferromagnetic spintronics with topological phenomena. The antiferromagnetic ordering can take a number of forms including fully compensated collinear, non-collinear, and non-coplanar magnetic lattices, compensated and uncompensated ferrimagnets, or metamagnetic materials hosting an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition. Apart from the variety of distinct magnetic crystal structures, the focused issue also encompasses spintronic phenomena and devices studied in antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructures and in synthetic antiferromagnets.

40|$|Increasingly, {{improvements}} in surface roughness and planarity are being sought {{in a variety}} of technologically advanced polishing applications related to the electronics industry. From the production of photomask blanks to the fabrication of <b>microelectronic</b> <b>memory</b> and process devices, {{improvements in}} global surface planarity and roughness, coupled with reduced incidents of defectivity, are critical to achieving the specifications of future technology nodes. Nanophase Technologies Corporation (NTC) uses a patented plasma arc synthesis technique to produce nano-sized cerium oxide (ceria) and aluminum oxide (alumina) particles in commercial quantities and quality. The small particle size, controlled particle size distribution, and unique crystal morphology of these materials are allowing new performance benchmarks to be realized in the planarization of silicon wafers and the polishing of photomask blanks, lithography optics and rigid memory substrates. However, {{the success or failure of}} a nanocrystalline material in a particular polishing application depends not only on the characteristics of the particle but also on the ability to form and maintain a stable dispersion of those particles with controlled rheology. Thus, both the attributes of the particles which provide utility in the above mentioned polishing applications as well as observations relevant to the production of stable dispersions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{layers of}} high {{dielectric}} constant materials are {{of special interest}} for memory, logic, and passive <b>microelectronic</b> applications. <b>Memory</b> storage capacitors based on these materials should exhibit high capacitance densities and low leakage currents. Here, we investigate a group of Hf- and Zr-based alkaline earth perovskites for this application. It is found that thin layers of polycrystalline BaHfO 3, SrHfO 3, and BaZrO 3 can provide capacitance densities about 2 times {{higher than that of}} amorphous HfO 2. Post deposition annealing above ~ 700 Â°C is a crucial processing step required for obtaining the cubic perovskite phase with high dielectric constant...|$|R
40|$|Using a high {{dielectric}} material as substitute for SiOxNy in dielectric film capacitors of dynamic memories (DRAM) allows {{a significantly higher}} integration density and a reduction of the die size, even with planar capacitors. BaTiO 3 is such a material. A dielectric constant of Epsilon r > 1000 has been achieved in thin films, made by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). For applications in <b>microelectronic</b> <b>memories</b> {{it is necessary to}} produce crystalline, defect-free and oriented BaTiO 3 thin films at substrate temperatures, TS < 450 deg C. Sintered targets of BaTiO 3 are ablated by KrF excimer laser radiation. The processing gas atmosphere consists of O 2 at pressures of 0. 1 - 50 Pa. The substrate is resitively heated to 360 - 440 deg C and annealed after or during PLD on Pt/Ti/Si multilayer substrates using KrF excimer laser radiation with fluences up to 120 mJ/cm 2. The temperature distribution in the BaTiO 3 /Pt/Ti/Si multilayers during laser annealing is dynamically modelled and related to the resulting crystal quality and the dielectric properties of the films. With PLD a minimum substrate temperature of 500 deg C is necessary to deposit crystalline BaTiO 3 films. Using in situ laser crystallisation crystalline BaTiO 3 films can be deposited at substrate temperatures of TS = 360 - 440 deg C showing a dielectric constant of up to Epsilon r = 1200. The ferroelectric and dielectric properties of the films are determined by C-V and P-V impedance measurements and correlated to the chemical and structural properties, as determined by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, micro Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

It considers point, line and interfacial defects {{in the context of}} structural transformations including annealing, spinodal decomposition, nucleation, growth, and particle coarsening. In addition, it concentrates on structure-function relationships, and in particular how grain size, interstitial and substitutional solid solutions, and second-phase particles impact mechanical and other properties.
