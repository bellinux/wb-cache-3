40|$|There is no large {{series about}} {{retained}} foreign bodies in abdominal cavity. In fact data are underestimated {{because of the}} lack of reports considering its serious medicolegal implications. An inflammatory fibrotic process inside the peritoneal cavity, a virtual discharge of inorganic material through the surgical incision and also a slow process of transmural migration into the intestinal lumen are the most frequent pathophysiologic situations. It is not uncommon the incidental diagnosis of foreign body and radiographic studies may be particularly helpful to elucidate the etiology. An early recognition minimizes the surgical risks and contributes to avoid severe complications. The best approach is to adopt preventive measures. Careful peroperative <b>materials</b> <b>vigilance</b> and instrumentation and also a meticulous check at the end of operations are essential to avoid such legal responsibility...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining student {{concentration}} in lectures {{has long been}} a challenge for lecturers. Pedagogical research consistently finds a drop in attention between 10 and 30 minutes into the lecture, which has been associated with the passive nature of the standard format, and has consequences for learning approaches and outcomes. A similar phenomenon has been observed in ergonomics for some time, known as the vigilance decrement. In this paper, we present an exploratory effort to detect the vigilance decrement in four different lecture formats, by adopting an ergonomics measurement tool which has been related to vigilance, and relating the findings to studentsâ€™ assessment results. It was found that standard lecture formats do induce a vigilance decrement, and this can adversely affect learning of the <b>material.</b> Conversely, <b>vigilance</b> degradation is avoided when presentation is varied, though this is not necessarily associated with interactive participation techniques. Implications for lecturing styles, learning approaches and pedagogical research methods are discussed...|$|R

This article describes how pristine was defined based on expectations of Bennu {{and on a}} realistic understanding of what is achievable with a constrained schedule and budget, and how that definition flowed to requirements and implementation. To return a pristine sample, the OSIRIS- REx spacecraft sampling hardware was maintained at level 100 A/ 2 and < 180 ng/cm 2 of amino acids and hydrazine on the sampler head through precision cleaning, control of <b>materials,</b> and <b>vigilance.</b> Contamination is further characterized via witness material exposed to the spacecraft assembly and testing environment {{as well as in}} space. This characterization provided knowledge of the expected background and will be used in conjunction with archived spacecraft components for comparison with the samples when they are delivered to Earth for analysis. Most of all, the cleanliness of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was achieved through communication among scientists, engineers, managers, and technicians.
