5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a <b>manger.</b> By Holy Tradition, the <b>manger</b> was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the <b>manger,</b> as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E

40|$|The {{attitude}} of male <b>mangers</b> toward {{the advancement of}} women in the industrial context: A comparative cultural study. The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine the attitudes of male <b>mangers</b> towards the advancement of women coming form the four cultural groups – white, black, Coloured and Indian, as well as women in general, within the business context. Five independent questionnaires were developed for this purpose. In general, it was found that black male managers were more positive in their attitudes towards women, than white male managers. In comparing the attitudes of male <b>mangers</b> towards women coming from the various cultural groups, it appeared that white male managers exhibited a particular hierarchical order of preferences, whilst black male <b>mangers</b> only indicated differences regarding whites versus Coloureds, and Indians versus Coloureds...|$|R

5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a <b>manger</b> (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city {{consists}} of eight quarters, {{laid out in a}} mosaic style, forming the area around the <b>Manger</b> Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas <b>Manger</b> could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E

25|$|At Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas {{by setting}} up the first known presepio or crèche (Nativity scene).

Thomas of Celano, a biographer of both Francis and Saint Bonaventure, tells how he used only a straw-filled <b>manger</b> (feeding trough) set between a real ox and donkey. According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the <b>manger</b> acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.|$|E
