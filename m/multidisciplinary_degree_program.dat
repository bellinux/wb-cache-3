40|$|AbstractImplementing {{geologic}} {{storage of}} carbon dioxide at a scale large {{enough to make a}} difference will require an industry of magnitude comparable to the current oil and gas industry (Bryant [1]; Orr [2]). Such an enterprise will require substantial human capital, but recognition of this need has been largely missing from discussions of GHG mitigation. To design, build, implement, optimize, troubleshoot, monitor and regulate large-scale carbon dioxide storage projects will require subsurface engineers. The same technologies that apply to hydrocarbon production apply to the subsurface storage {{of carbon dioxide}}. Thus one might naturally expect to hire petroleum engineering (PE) graduates to staff a carbon storage industry. We argue that it is unrealistic to depend on PE graduates to staff the carbon storage industry, for three reasons: (i) continued large demand for hydrocarbons is unlikely to abate; (ii) a demographic gap in {{the oil and gas industry}} will continue to place an extraordinary premium on new graduates; and (iii) existing PE departments in the US and abroad are already operating at or above capacity. In short, there are neither classrooms nor faculty sufficient to educate enough petroleum engineers for the petroleum industry. Even if there were, it would be difficult for an emerging carbon storage industry to compete for graduates with oil and gas companies. We advocate that the solution to this manpower problem is building new educational infrastructure. We propose a prototype program based on an existing accredited <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> at The University of Texas at Austin, known as Geosystems Engineering and Hydrogeology. Offered jointly by the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department and the Department of Geological Sciences, this program combines the fundamentals of petroleum engineering with the subsurface architecture emphasis of geology and the environmental perspective of hydrogeology. The latter is salient given the priority of protecting groundwater resources during geologic storage. With modest redesign of the curriculum but with substantial expansion of classrooms, laboratories and faculty, we argue that the program would be able to graduate significant numbers of “carbon management engineers” within six years. The problem of timing is particularly difficult. The lead time to develop such a program is long, even when starting from an existing degree program. A geologic storage industry will not begin until a regulatory framework and some form of carbon market or price are established. Ensuring that the carbon management industry is not starved of talent will thus require a rare combination of shared vision amongst university administrators, government agencies and industry...|$|E
40|$|Universities have {{gradually}} moved toward a fee-for-service {{mode of operation}} over the last decade. Offering new academic programs which will attract increasing student numbers is ever more important to universities and this, in turn, requires a greater awareness of market needs and the positioning of educational offerings. A theory-based study {{of the literature on}} new service products {{led to the development of}} the New Educational Service Product Offerings (NESPO) model for universities offering such <b>multidisciplinary,</b> niche-focused <b>degree</b> <b>programs,</b> which forms the basis of the research project reported here. This paper begins by considering the literary foundations of the model. Using a multiple case study of eBusiness programs in the Asia-Pacific region over the period 2000 - 2003, it then analyses the findings of the cases, determining whether the universities surveyed were making use of the concepts of new service product development in developing their eBusiness educational programs. Finally, the paper considers whether (and to what extent) these findings are applicable more widely to a range of niche-market, <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>degree</b> <b>programs.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a rapid {{expansion}} of <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>degree</b> programmes offered by Universities around the globe, with many being classified as design orientated or using the title Creative Technologies.

To obtain an understanding of the programmes, each is mapped in to Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning so that a comparison {{of the nature of the}} programmes can be made independently from the content. This analysis suggests that the multidisciplinary programme is in many ways an orthodox recombination of disciplinary approaches that potentially produces challenges in organising and structuring content so as to provide depth as well as breadth of coverage.
