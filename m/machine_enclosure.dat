At present, guards on {{woodworking}} machine tools have to undergo an impact test with a 100 g projectile and an impact speed of 70 m/s {{to protect the}} operator against breaking tools. At the moment, only sheet metal housings and plastic elements of polycarbonate as well as particular safety curtain systems meet these requirements regarding the retention capacity of machine enclosures for woodworking centres according to EN 848 - 3. In context of this work, a <b>machine</b> <b>enclosure</b> made out of lightweight materials was developed as alternative to the conventional sheet metal housings. A solution for safety curtains that passes easy over the workpieces without damaging the edges was also worked out. With regard to rigid guards, {{many different kinds of}} material combinations were examined concerning retention capacity and acoustic behaviour. In addition to the experimental tests, a FEM model was developed representing the impact behaviour of the composite based. Finally, a lightweight enclosure prototype was designed and examined with regard to the retention capacity at critical spots and of sound emission...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{investigation}} of heat transfer in air cooled Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) electrical machines is carried out. Efficiency of electrical machines is strongly influenced by an effective cooling which is provided by forced convection: air enters the generator through the opening in the <b>machine</b> <b>enclosure</b> and leaves it radially, as it is forced out by the rotating discs. The main goal is the enhancement of the heat transfer from the stator where heat is generated in the copper windings. On the other hand the heat transfer to the rotor needs to be minimised {{in order to keep}} the magnets' temperature as low as possible. The cooling can be improved by acting on design parameters, such as the distance between the stator and the rotors (commonly named running clearance), the magnet depth, and by acting on operational parameters, such as the rotational speed. The investigation is carried out by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to model air flow and heat transfer inside the AFPM machines. The experimental validation of the numerical models confirmed the capability of the CFD software in predicting the air mass flow rate and the heat transfer in the AFPM machines. The thesis describes the effects of the above mentioned parameters on target quantities, such as the heat transfer coefficients on the generator surfaces, the air mass flow rate through the machine, and the resistive torque. General correlations in non-dimensional form are obtained for the calculation of the heat transfer on the generator surfaces in the AFPM machines as a function of the above parameters. General correlations have also been obtained for the calculations of the non-dimensional air mass flow rate through the machine and for the non-dimensional resistive torque. It was found that the corresponding relationships between the peripheral Reynolds number and local Nusselt numbers on the generator surfaces and the non-dimensional mass flow rate are linear. However, the dependency of Nusselt number on the non dimensional clearance and the magnet depth is non-linear. For the investigated range of the parameters the following was established: an increase in the peripheral Reynolds number results in higher Nusselt number on both the rotating and stationary surfaces of machines; an increase in the running clearance results in the reduction of the Nusselt number on the machine surfaces; the magnetic segments installed on the surface of the flat rotor act as blades of a radial compressor increasing the air mass flow rate and the corresponding Nusselt number on the stator surface. The combination of the non-dimensional running clearance equal to 9 10 - 3 and the non-dimensional magnet depth equal to 7. 3 10 - 2 was found to be the one which provides the maximum heat transfer from the stator. This piece of information can be used in the design stage for improving the cooling of AFPM electrical machines without increasing the windage losses and contribute in this way to the enhancement of the overall efficiency of this type of machines.

40|$|The {{paper has}} been {{presented}} at the 12 th International Conference on Applications of Computer Algebra, Varna, Bulgaria, June, 2006. To get guaranteed <b>machine</b> <b>enclosures</b> of a special function f(x), an upper bound ε(f) of the relative error is needed, where ε(f) itself depends on the error bounds ε(app); ε(eval) of the approximation and evaluation error respectively. The approximation function g(x) ≈ f(x) is a rational function (Remez algorithm), and with sufficiently high polynomial degrees ε(app) becomes sufficiently small. Evaluating g(x) on the machine produces a rather great ε(eval) because {{of the division of}} the two erroneous polynomials. However, ε(eval) can distinctly be decreased, if the rational function g(x) is substituted by an appropriate continued fraction c(x) which in general needs less elementary operations than the original rational function g(x). Numerical examples will illustrate this advantage...|$|R
40|$|Steel sheets bonded with a {{thin layer}} of a {{polymeric}} adhesive are used for their sound-deadening effect in applications such as <b>machine</b> <b>enclosures</b> and automobile bulk-heads. Unlike sandwich materials designed primarily for high rigidity, they are formed by conventional methods and the effect of the relative inability of the adhesive to transmit shear on formability of the sheet and conformity to the tool profile is important. The adhesive in sheet steel/adhesive/steel laminate used for acoustic damping displays viscoelasticity only at small strain, and strain hardening is associated with subsequent viscous flow. High forming speed is favourable to the forming of steel sheet laminate bonded with a viscoplastic polymeric adhesive because it increases the ability of the adhesive to transmit shear forces, which in turn increases the transverse stiffness of sheet laminates, although it increases springback (decreases the shape fixability of the laminate). At elevated temperature, the softening of the steel sheets {{as well as that of}} the adhesive is significant, decreasing the rigidity but improving the shape fixability of the laminate. © 1990...|$|R
40|$|Reduction {{of noise}} in a {{compressor}} {{is a complex}} criterion as many factors of <b>machine</b> <b>enclosure</b> contribute its effect on noise. When a panel of enclosure is acoustically excited, its vibrational response comprises both forced vibrational response at the excitation frequencies, and resonant response of all the relevant structural natural frequencies. These are excited due to the interactions of the forced bending waves with the panel boundaries. The non-resonant, forced modes tend to transmit most of the sound at frequencies below the critical frequency. The resonant frequencies below critical frequency are very poor sound transmitters or radiators. Thus, at frequencies below the critical frequency, mass of the panel controls the reduction in sound transmission since the low frequency resonant structural modes do not radiate or transmit sound. Above the critical frequency, it is the resonant modes that transmit most of the sound. The one qualification to the phenomenan discussed {{here is that the}} incident sound field has to be diffused – i. e. no acoustic standing waves are present in the fluid medium adjacent to the panel. Each structure exhibits certain low and high frequency response. The response of a panel depends on whether it is mechanically or acoustically excited. In this paper, acoustic enclosure for a compressor model is designed and analysis of the enclosure structure is carried out. A method is presented to reduce noise by structural modifications of enclosure. Efforts have been made to make use of experimental data as input to software and methods to do the validation of output results which matches fairly with the experimental data. In acoustic fluid-structural interactions, the structural dynamics equations were considered along with Navier-Stokes equation of fluid momentum and flow continuity equation. The radiation of sound from body can be formulated in terms of an integral equation involving Green’s functions with an imposed radiation. Green’s functions represent solutions to the wave equation – they can also be considered to be either frequency or impulse response functions between the source and receiver. Modeling of enclosure was done. The material used for panels of the enclosure was made of composite steel. The noise measurements on 10 mounting points where compressor comes in contact with the structure were carried. The results were plotted in both frequency and time domain; i. e. dynamic analysis of structure. The analysis of the structure was carried out in NASTRAN. The measured forces were applied to the enclosure structure at mounting points. Response was then measured at desired points. Authors found that, there were some variations in actual measurement data and the results acquired in software analysis. Guiding phenomenon was implemented to reduce the noise i. e. obstacles to the wave propagation were provided. The points where noise level was maximum than the required, barriers, and ribs were provided, etc. Again noise measurements were done. Numbers of iterations were performed until measured noise data tallies with analysis data in the prescribed limit. This Design approach can be used for similar problems involving structure – borne noise sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{best way}} to {{extend the life of}} a {{metalworking}} fluid (MWF) is to make sure the machine tool and MWF delivery system are properly cleaned at least once per year. The dilemma the MWF manager is faced with is: How does one clean the machine tool and the MWF system on a large machine tool with an enclosure in a timely manner without impacting production schedules? Remember the walls and roof of the <b>machine</b> <b>enclosure</b> are coated with a film of dried contaminated MWF that must also be removed. If not removed, the deposits on these surfaces can recontaminate the fresh charge of MWF. I have found a product that with this revised procedure helps to shorten the machine tool down time involved with machine cleaning. (1) Discuss with your MWF supplier if they have a machine cleaning product that can be used with your current water based MWF during normal machining operations. Most MWF manufacturers have a machine cleaner that can be used at a lower concentration (1 - 2 % vs. 5 %) and can be used while still making production parts {{for a short period of}} time (usually 24 - 48 hours). (2) Make sure this machine cleaner is compatible with the work-piece material you are machining into product. Most cleaners are compatible with ferrous alloys. Because of the increased alkalinity of the fluid you might experience staining if you are machining copper or aluminum alloys. (3) Remove the chips from the chips pans and fluid channels. (4) During off shift hours circulate the MWF using a new product marketed by Rego-Fix called a 'Hydroball'. This device has a 5 / 8 inch diameter straight shank which allows it to be installed in any collet or solid quick change tool holder. It has multiple nozzles so that the user can control the spray pattern generated when the MWF is circulated. It allows the user to utilize the high pressure, through spindle MWF delivery capability of your machine tool for cleaning purposes. The high pressure MWF system can now be effectively used for cleaning purposes. This will also work with standard pressure system but you must reduce the number of nozzles utilized. By combining the movement of the machine axis around the operating envelope and the MWF circulation you can do a reasonably effective job of washing the inside of the machine tool operating cavity. Way covers will be moved and surfaces exposed because of axis movement. Spray direction will change to better wash fixtures and machine tool components. Deposits will start to breakdown and be washed into the machine tool sump. Since the cycle will run four or more hours it can be done with a weaker cleaning solution. The distributor states that the unit can be rotated up to 50 RPM. When running it has the same effect as the washing rotor inside of your home dishwasher. Inside the cavity on a machining center there is a lot of splash. During normal operations, MWF deposits buildup on the walls and roof of the enclosures. If these deposits (containing bacteria, mold and other contaminants) are not removed they will inoculate the fresh charge of MWF when they are resaturated. When you clean the inside of machine tool cavity, time is spent removing these deposits on the walls and roof of the enclosure. Getting to these surfaces is very difficult usually requiring that a member of the cleaning crew get inside the machine tool to reach them. The Hydro ball is effective in distributing the cleaning solution on all surfaces of the enclosure under high pressure. The only negative we have found is you get to find all the gaps and leaks in your machine tool enclosure. By running the hydro ball with the machine cleaner enriched MWF during off shift (4 - 8 hours) you can effectively remove these deposits and buildups on the internal surfaces of the cavity of the machine tool and wash them down into the sump. You also clean the internal components of the MWF system without interrupting normal scheduled work. (5) Pump out the spent MWF. You will have found that most of the deposits have been washed from the internal surfaces of the enclosure. For extremely dirty machines you might have to refill the machine tool with the normal machine cleaner mix. You will find that even heavy deposits will break down quicker because of this pre-wash cycle. (6) Rinse the machine cavity. (7) Clean the walls, bottom and screens in the MWF reservoir. The use of this tool and the dilute machine cleaner reduced the cleaning time considerately without affecting production schedules. (8) Refill with MWF and resume normal operations. What we like about this system is we can schedule these light cleanings just before a scheduled fluid change. Add the cleaner to the mix and run the Hydroball on second shift. The spent fluid is pumped out on third shift and the machine refilled. The machine tool with a fresh charge of MWF is ready for first shift without interrupting production schedules. We get better life from our MWFs and the machinists are happier about the condition of their machines...|$|E

50|$|The K-431, {{completed}} around 1965 as unit K-31, was a Project 675 (Echo II) class submarine {{with two}} pressurized water reactors, each 70 MWt capacity and using 20% enriched uranium as fuel. On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor tank lid was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly {{and had to}} be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control rods was lifted up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a criticality excursion of about 5&middot;1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the <b>machine</b> <b>enclosures,</b> ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within 50-100 metres of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a 6 km stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, 1.5 km from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as 2 km2 in a swath 3.5 km long and 200 to 650 metres wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products. In part because the reactor did not contain spent fuel, the fraction of biologically active isotopes was far smaller than {{in the case of the}} Chernobyl disaster.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{structures}} made of metallic hollow spheres (Metal Hollow Sphere Structures, MHSS) {{were successfully}} tested as sound absorbers for {{the reduction of}} noise in several applications, e. g. as silencers and enclosures. Advantageous properties of this new absorber material are the high temperature resistance and the high mechanical strength. Self-supporting structures without any additional housing will be possible in future.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Manuscript I: The {{removal of}} {{residual}} casting material from gating {{has traditionally been}} performed by abrasive grinding techniques. However, high amounts of belt wear can occur when working with high strength alloys, especially those typically seen in the aerospace industry. An alternative machining process called electrochemical machining (ECM) uses electrolysis to precisely remove material at high rates. ECM has many advantages over conventional grinding: no tool wear, no induced mechanical or thermal stresses, and high removal rates independent of material hardness or strength. The industrial application of ECM to residual casting material removal can potentially realize large cost savings and decreased component processing time by eliminating belt wear and increasing material removal rates. The approach taken in this work is the design and fabrication of a laboratory apparatus {{for the purpose of}} testing the ECM of casting material. Commercial ECM machines, while more powerful, can be excessively large and cost prohibitive when performing an initial feasibility study. Many times these commercial machines are calibrated to mass produce a specific part, and do not have the level of variability desired for laboratory experimentation. The test apparatus presented provides a robust and relatively low cost method of investigating the applicability of ECM to this purpose. The device is comprised of an electrolyte filtration and delivery system, a stable <b>machining</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and a single axis computer controlled tool. The ECM variables that can be adjusted include electrolyte temperature, mass flow rate, applied voltage, tool feed rate, and electrode gap. Process data from these variables is collected via multiple sensors in the machine and provides real-time feedback to users. A universal tool connection and workpiece fixture allows for different experimental setups to be easily tested. From experimentation with this test apparatus, {{it will be possible to}} identify optimum methods for the ECM of these residual casting artifacts. Manuscript II: Rapid tool wear can occur during the removal of residual protrusions from high strength alloy parts. In this work, a new method of using electrochemical machining (ECM) capsules to remove protrusions without any tool wear is presented. An ECM capsule is an electrochemical cell that is placed on a part over a protrusion, and removes material through electrolysis. These capsules are advantageous due to their low cost and simplicity compared to conventional ECM equipment. The use of these capsules is demonstrated in two ways. First, a parameter optimization was performed on the material removal rates of Inconel 718 and Titanium 6 - 4 bar stock using a 2 ⁸⁻⁴ fractional factorial design of experiments. Then, using the optimized values, torch-cut protrusions were machined off of manufactured Titanium 6 - 4 parts. Inherent variability in the geometry of the protrusions rendered it difficult to completely remove the protrusions without cutting into the part. Surface scans of the parts showed that the capsules were able to successfully remove between 63...|$|R
