50|$|In FM {{broadcasting}} {{and other}} analog radio media, multiplexing {{is a term}} commonly given {{to the process of}} adding subcarriers to the audio signal before it enters the transmitter, where modulation occurs. (In fact, the stereo <b>multiplex</b> <b>signal</b> can be generated using time-division multiplexing, by switching between the two (left channel and right channel) input signals at an ultrasonic rate (the subcarrier), and then filtering out the higher harmonics.) Multiplexing in this sense is sometimes known as MPX, which in turn is also an old term for stereophonic FM, seen on stereo systems since the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|FM stereo {{broadcasting}} {{is known}} to incur up to a 23 dB noise penalty over that of monophonic FM broadcasting; {{this is due to}} the combination of the triangular FM noise spectrum and the wider baseband bandwidth occupied by the stereo <b>multiplex</b> <b>signal.</b> Developed at the CBS Technology Center, FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst. This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitude-compressed version of the L&minus;R (left-minus-right, or difference) signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier, using a version of the CX noise-reduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records.|$|E

40|$|A novel compressive-sensing based <b>signal</b> <b>multiplexing</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} to further improve the multiplexing gain for {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal.</b> In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO multiplexing scheme.
