5000|$|After the {{introduction}} of the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Funding</b> <b>Requirement,</b> there were several modifications to the assumptions to cope with perceived weaknesses in the original basis. However, the level of assets required by the MFR never proved sufficient to provide the benefits promised by the scheme which the MFR was supposed to fund. The Pensions Act 2004 abolished the MFR and introduced a new scheme funding objective hoped to adapt more flexibly to individual schemes' circumstances {{but at the same time}} protecting members' benefits. Paul Myners report states on page 4: [...] "I propose replacing the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Funding</b> <b>Requirement,</b> which distorts investment and fails to protect scheme members, with a long-term approach based on disclosure and openness instead of an artificial uniform yardstick." ...|$|E

The PPF protected liability is the level of compensation that would be paid if the scheme were transferred to the PPF, it can either be the complete actuarial valuation according to section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004 or the adapted MFR (<b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirement)</b> liability, and normally it should be smaller than the ‘true’ pension liabilities given by FRS 17 or IAS 19 liabilities.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the introduction of the}} Pensions Act 1995, it was widely perceived that it was failing to offer the protection to pension scheme members that had been anticipated. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority was perceived as being reactive, didactic and uncommercial. The <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirement</b> had not prevented some pension schemes winding up with insufficient assets to secure their liabilities, amid considerable publicity. There was strong political pressure to establish a guarantee fund similar to the American Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Much of the regulation was perceived to be unnecessarily restrictive. The Pensions Act 2004 was written to try to fix these deficiences. The Act introduced two new regulatory institutions: the Pensions Regulator, with the powers to require sponsoring companies to make contributions to ensure that scheme funding objectives are met; and the Pension Protection Fund, which would inherit the pension liabilities of a pension scheme in the event that a sponsoring company becomes insolvent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} which [...] "propelled {{her into}} the media spotlight" [...] began in July 2002 when Allied Steel and Wire, part of the former UK nationalised steel industry with plant in Sheerness and Cardiff went into receivership. Although their pension scheme was [...] "fully funded" [...] according to the prescribed UK government <b>Minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirement</b> formula, this level of funding was only sufficient to pay those already retired. The existing workforce, {{many of whom had}} very long service and were close to retirement, faced losing their entire pension, including their so-called Guaranteed Minimum Pension, which was introduced by the Government to replace some of their state pension entitlement, but {{which turned out to be}} neither guaranteed nor a minimum.

[...] "She has vast experience in the field, having managed institutional investment portfolios for 15 years, including pension funds, insurance funds and unit trusts."Believing that once the facts were established, the government would recognise its mistake and provide rapid compensation, Altmann spearheaded the Pensionstheft Action Group encouraging members to lobby their MPs for compensation and write to local newspapers. She used her political and press contacts to ensure PAG appeared regularly in news bulletins and newspapers and devised the banner [...] "Stripped of our pensions".

5000|$|A {{significant}} number of complaints were received by members of wound-up final salary occupational pension schemes who learned that the funds of {{which they had been}} members were insufficiently funded. They complained that official information provided by the Government about the security of the pension schemes was misleading and that warnings were not provided about the risks to the schemes in response to an actuarial recommendation in 2000 that such a warning be given. In March 2006, Abraham published a report into the matter — titled Trusting in the Pensions Promise - under s10(3) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 following referrals by more than 200 MPs. She found that official information provided by the Government was often inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent; that the response to the actuarial recommendation was maladministration; and a decision to change the <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirement</b> was done maladministratively. Complainants had sustained a sense of outrage, had lost opportunities to make informed choices or take remedial action and had suffered distress, anxiety and uncertainty. She made five recommendations, including that the Government consider arranging for the restoration of the pensions benefits. [...] The Government rejected the report, insisting that the case for maladministration was not found out and that it was not in the public interest to compensate the pension schemes. In response, Abraham expressed disappointment at the Government's attitude and commented that it raised doubts about the commitment of the Government to the Ombudsman scheme. [...] To the Select Committee, she noted that she sought to constructively engage with the Government: [...] "it is maladministration, get over it and let us get on to engagement with the real issues here" [...] The Select Committee supported Abraham, issuing a report which found that the Government bore some responsibility for compensating those affected. The Government reiterated its position and legal action by complainants followed. In the Court of Appeal it was held in February 2008 that the Government could not reject the findings of the Ombudsman without reason. The Government was compelled to reconsider Abraham's recommendation that arrangements be made to restore pension benefits. [...] It made parallel moves to improve the Financial Assistance Scheme which provided assistance to those whose pension schemes had begun to wind up. After pressure from the Select Committee, it was ultimately decided by the Government in December 2007 to guarantee the Financial Assistance Scheme to 90%. Abraham welcomed this move as compliance with her key recommendations, although the Government did not acknowledge acceptance of her findings.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Funding</b> <b>Requirement</b> (MFR) (pre- 1999 version) under random future investment conditions. In particular, do the various liabilities calculated under the MFR deliver a suitable level of security to pension scheme members ? The paper considers active (and deferred) members and current pensioners separately. For active members, Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare how the proceeds arising from investment of the pre- 1999 MFR liability in an equity-backed personal pension would compare with the deferred pension promised by the scheme. It is found that while there may be the intended 50 % chance that the personal pension has a better outcome there are very substantial downside risks for younger members. Investment strategies based upon index-linked gilts are shown to result, on average, in lower personal pensions but they provide an extremely effective means of limiting the downside risks.

40|$|We study firms' pension prefunding and {{portfolio}} allocation {{choices in}} a model in which firms trade off the need to compensate workers for the financial risk in their pension benefit against the cost advantage that may be gained by exploiting underpriced pension insurance. In the absence of pension insurance, the firm minimizes costs by rendering promised benefits free of risk to workers, who {{are assumed to be}} unable to hedge firm-specific risk. Various forms of government intervention, such as benefit guarantees, can alter this outcome dramatically by providing the firm with an incentive to shift risk to other parties. In this case, we find that the firm's decisions depend on, among other influences, the degree of insurance mispricing, the amount of guaranteed benefits, the stringency of <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirements,</b> and the costs of financial distress.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Labor costs {{are included in the}} prices contractors negotiate with the Department of Defense (DOD), and include pension costs as these are a normal element of employee compensation. Contractors make two sets of calculations for their defined benefit pension plans, following two sets of standards: (1) Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which determine how pension costs are allocated to government contracts; and (2) Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which establishes the minimum contribution required to fund plans. In 2008, revised ERISA rules altered the <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirements,</b> causing CAS costs and ERISA contributions to diverge further apart. ERISA contributions have therefore greatly exceeded CAS pension costs reflected in contract prices.

40|$|In several states, public {{pension plans}} {{are at risk}} of {{insolvency}} within a decade. These risks are significant, and the solutions currently contemplated are likely to fall short of what is necessary to contain the problem. If public pension plans do become insolvent, it seems likely the federal government will bail them out. This Article proposes that the federal government prepare for the prospect of federal financial support of public pension plans by instituting an optional regulatory regime for public pensions. If a state elects not to participate, its public pension plans would be ineligible for federal financial support. In states that do elect to participate, public plans would be eligible for federal financial support in the event of severe financial distress. All public plans in these states would be subject to a federal regulatory regime similar to ERISA, including <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirements.</b> Congress could also authorize sponsors of regulated plans to revise existing employees’ retirement benefits with respect to future services, an option that is available to private employers.

40|$|A single {{valuation}} basis (using market values) now {{dominates the}} valuation of pension scheme assets and {{has replaced the}} previously dominant actuarial and accounting bases. The same cannot be said for pension scheme liabilities. There are three different valuation bases for liabilities currently in use: a statutory basis (specified in the 1986 Finance Act), an actuarial basis (the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Funding</b> <b>Requirement,</b> specified in the 1995 Pensions Act) and an accounting basis (specified in Financial Reporting Standard 17). Since each of these uses different underlying assumptions, the three bases are not consistent {{with each other and}} produce substantially different measures of pension scheme liabilities. None of these measures corresponds to an economic valuation. Moves should be made to develop a single valuation basis for pension liabilities. A key difference relates to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future pension payments. The Accounting Standards Board’s new FRS 17 and the recent MFR Review conducted by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries have both proposed a bond-based discount rate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is pushing pension fund asset allocations towards bonds in an attempt to reduce the short-term volatility mismatch between assets and liabilities. Moves should be made t...|$|E
40|$|The {{trustees}} of funded defined benefit pension schemes must make two vital and inter-related decisions - setting the asset allocation and the contribution rate. While these decisions are usually taken separately, {{it is argued}} that they are intimately related and should be taken jointly. The objective of funded pension schemes is taken to be the minimization of both the mean and the variance of the contribution rate, where the asset allocation decision is designed to achieve this objective. This is done by splitting the problem into two main steps. First, the Markowitz mean-variance model is generalised to include three types of pension scheme liabilities (actives, deferreds and pensioners), and this model is used to generate the efficient set of asset allocations. Second, for each point on the risk-return efficient set of the asset-liability portfolio model, the mathematical model of Haberman (1992) is used to compute the corresponding mean and variance of the contribution rate and funding ratio. Since the Haberman model assumes that the discount rate for computing the present value of liabilities equals the investment return, it is generalised to avoid this restriction. This generalisation removes the trade-off between contribution rate risk and funding ratio risk for a fixed spread period. Pension schemes need to choose a spread period, and it is shown how this can be set to minimise the variance of the contribution rate. Finally, using the result that the funding ratio follows an inverted gamma distribution, shortfall risk and expected tail loss are computed for funding below the <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirement,</b> and funding above the taxation limit. This model is then applied to one of the largest UK pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a defined benefit pension {{guarantee}} system for the UK, based on an analogy between pension liabilities and corporate debt obligations. We show that the PPF is likely to face many years of low claims interspersed irregularly with periods of very large claims. There is a significant chance that these claims will be so large that the PPF will default on its liabilities, leaving the government with no option but to bail it out. The cause of this problem is the double impact of a fall in equity prices on the PPF: it makes sponsor firms more likely to default and it makes defaulted plans more likely to be underfunded. We use our model to derive a fair premium for PPF insurance under different circumstances, to estimate the extent of cross-subsidies in the PPF between strong and weak sponsors, and to show that risk-rated premiums are unlikely to have a substantial effect on either the size or the lumpiness of claims. We argue that for the PPF to operate effectively, it should be introduced in tandem with strong <b>minimum</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirements</b> and a lower level of benefit guarantee than at present...|$|R
