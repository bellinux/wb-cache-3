I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by <b>my</b> <b>teaching.</b> I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} myth to credit Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) to Deming. Deming {{referred}} to the PDCA cycle as a [...] "corruption." [...] Deming worked from the Shewhart cycle and over time eventually developed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which has the idea of deductive and inductive learning built into the learning and improvement cycle. [...] Deming finally published the PDSA cycle in 1993, in The New Economics on p.132. Deming has added to the myth that he taught the Japanese the PDSA cycle with this quote on p.247, [...] "The PDSA Cycle originated in <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> in Japan in 1950.

Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both to me and to others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the use of}} differentiation in an elementary classroom, which was inspired after <b>my</b> student <b>teaching</b> placement. During <b>my</b> student <b>teaching</b> in a 2 nd grade classroom, I had {{a diverse group of}} learners. I completed <b>my</b> student <b>teaching</b> wondering what could be done to better educate students in a way that best fit their learning styles and levels. It is the teacher's responsibility to educate the students no matter what their needs. Individual needs of students can be met by using differentiation in the classroom to adapt lesson plans and teach them in a way by which they learn best. I wrote a few example lesson plans for teachers to use for ideas on how to use different methods of differentiation in a classroom. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
