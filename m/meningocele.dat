25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, <b>meningocele,</b> meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, <b>meningocele,</b> and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. <b>Meningocele</b> typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E

5000|$|A {{posterior}} <b>meningocele</b> (...) or meningeal cyst (...) is {{the least}} common form of spina bifida. In this form, a single developmental defect allows the meninges to herniate between the vertebrae. As the nervous system remains undamaged, individuals with <b>meningocele</b> are unlikely to suffer long-term health problems, although cases of tethered cord have been reported. Causes of <b>meningocele</b> include teratoma and other tumors of the sacrococcyx and of the presacral space, and Currarino syndrome.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} <b>meningocele</b> and myelomeningocele. <b>Meningocele</b> is {{less severe}} and {{is characterized by}} herniation of the meninges, but not the spinal cord, through the opening in the spinal canal. Myelomeningocele involves herniation of the meninges {{as well as the}} spinal cord through the opening.|$|E
50|$|About 80-90% of fetuses or newborn {{infants with}} spina bifida—often {{associated}} with <b>meningocele</b> or myelomeningocele—develop hydrocephalus.|$|E
50|$|Meningohydroencephalocoele (AmE: meningohydroencephalocele) {{is a form}} of <b>meningocele</b> (AmE) - a {{developmental}} abnormality of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The lateral <b>meningocele</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a very}} rare skeletal disorder with facial anomalies, hypotonia and meningocele-related neurologic dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|There are two types: {{spina bifida}} occulta and spina bifida cystica. Spina bifida cystica can then {{be broken down into}} <b>meningocele</b> and myelomeningocele.|$|E
50|$|The {{two cases}} {{reported}} by Posalaki et al. showed blastema, glomeruli and tubuli. In several cases {{the mass was}} removed during reparative surgery for <b>meningocele</b> or myelomeningocele.|$|E
5000|$|Congenital swellings {{are present}} since birth, {{such as a}} {{hemangioma}} or <b>meningocele.</b> Some congenital swellings may not be discovered until later in life, such as a branchial cyst, dermoid cyst or thyroglossal cyst.|$|E
5000|$|Radiographically, Dural ectasia {{can lead}} to {{scalloping}} of the posterior vertebral bodies and {{to the formation of}} cystic diverticula of the dura of the spine (termed meningoceles. This <b>meningocele</b> is not related to spina bifida).|$|E

50|$|The presacral space {{may contain}} {{one of several}} kinds of tumor. The most common tumor here is sacrococcygeal teratoma. Others are retrorectal hamartoma (tailgut cyst), schwannoma, ganglioneuroma, and ependymoma.

50|$|A pseudomeningocele is an {{abnormal}} collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that communicates with the CSF space around the brain or spinal cord. In {{contrast to a}} <b>meningocele,</b> in which the fluid is surrounded and confined by dura mater, in a pseudomeningocele, the fluid has no surrounding membrane, but is contained in a cavity within the soft tissues.|$|E
50|$|A <b>meningocele</b> {{may also}} form through dehiscences {{in the base}} of the skull. These may be {{classified}} by their localisation to occipital, frontoethmoidal, or nasal. Endonasal meningoceles lie at the roof of the nasal cavity and may be mistaken for a nasal polyp. They are treated surgically. Encephalomeningoceles are classified in the same way and also contain brain tissue.|$|E
50|$|The Currarino {{syndrome}} (also Currarino triad) is {{an inherited}} congenital disorder where (1) the sacrum (the fused vertebrae forming {{the back of}} the pelvis) is not formed properly, (2) there is a mass in the presacral space in front of the sacrum, and (3) there are malformations of the anus or rectum. It can also cause an anterior <b>meningocele</b> or a presacral teratoma.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 25,000 children, {{mostly from}} lower-income families, where {{admitted}} to hospital for preventable respiratory infections aggravated by poor houses. In New Zealand {{many of the}} health problems {{are related to the}} quality of New Zealand houses and housing standards in New Zealand, and overcrowding. Dr Michael Baker, Associate Professor of Public Health at Otago University, recognises household crowding as the main risk factors for <b>meningocele</b> disease, rheumatic fever, and tuberculosis. Housing costs influence directly the poverty experienced in low-income households with children.|$|E
50|$|Encephaloceles of {{the face}} are {{generally}} classified as nasofrontal, nasoethmoidal, or naso-orbital, however, there can be some overlap {{in the type of}} encephalocele. They can also appear along any part of the cranial vault as they result from abnormal closure of cranial bones; the most common location for enncephaloceles is the occipital region. If the bulging portion contains only cerebrospinal fluid and the overlying membrane, it may be called a <b>meningocele.</b> If brain tissue is present, it may be referred to as a meningoencephalocele.|$|E
50|$|In humans, a {{major cause}} of perineal hernia is perineal surgery without {{adequate}} reconstruction. In some cases, particularly surgeries to remove the coccyx and distal sacrum, adequate reconstruction is very difficult to achieve. The posterior perineum is a preferred point of access for surgery in the pelvic cavity, particularly in the presacral space. Surgeries here include repair of rectal prolapse and anterior <b>meningocele,</b> radical perineal prostatectomy, removal of tumors including sacrococcygeal teratoma, and coccygectomy. Perineal hernia is a common complication of coccygectomy in adults, but not in infants and children (see coccygectomy).|$|E
50|$|Many organ {{systems are}} {{affected}} by triploidy, but {{the central nervous system}} and skeleton are the most severely affected. Common central nervous system defects seen in triploidy include holoprosencephaly, hydrocephalus (increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain), ventriculomegaly, Arnold-Chiari malformation, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and neural tube defects. Skeletal manifestations include cleft lip/palate, hypertelorism, club foot, and syndactyly of fingers three and four. Congenital heart defects, hydronephrosis, omphalocele, and <b>meningocele</b> (spina bifida) are also common. Cystic hygromas occur but are uncommon. Triploid fetuses have intrauterine growth restriction beginning early in the pregnancy, as early as 12 weeks, and does not affect the head as severely as the body. Oligohydramnios, low levels of amniotic fluid, is common in triploid pregnancies.|$|E
5000|$|Sacrococcygeal {{teratoma}} (SCT) {{is a type}} of tumor {{known as}} a teratoma that develops {{at the base of the}} coccyx (tailbone) and is thought to be derived from the primitive streak. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are benign 75% of the time, malignant 12% of the time, and the remainder are considered [...] "immature teratomas" [...] that share benign and malignant features. Benign sacrococcygeal teratomas are more likely to develop in younger children who are less than 5 months old, and older children are more likely to develop malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas. The Currarino triad (OMIM 176450), due to an autosomal dominant mutation in the MNX1 gene, consists of a presacral mass (usually a mature teratoma or anterior <b>meningocele),</b> anorectal malformation and sacral dysgenesis.|$|E
50|$|According to physicians, {{the tail}} Oram has {{is not a}} real tail, but a {{congenital}} malformation known as spina bifida, in this case of the rare <b>meningocele</b> category. It is possible for human embryos to develop a real tail, as the genes which cause it still exist in many people. However, the probability of this gene expressing is very low: it can happen because of rare recessive gene coupling, or some form of mutation that brings the gene back to a dominant place. That is why very few cases have been recorded {{in the history of}} medicine. The presence of these kind of vestigial structures is known as an atavism. When a human embryo develops a true tail, it is located as a prolongation of the coccyx, just like the tail of a dog or a monkey.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Intrathoracic <b>meningocele</b> is {{rare and}} is usually {{associated}} with neurofibromatosis type I. Most of the re-ported thoracic meningoceles are not strictly anterior in location, but also lateral or anterolateral. We report a case of true anterior thoracic <b>meningocele</b> with no associated generalized mesenchymal dysplasia. A spinal <b>meningocele</b> is a herniation of the menin-ges through a foramina or a defect in the vertebral column and is frequently located posteriorly in the lumbosacral area. An anterior spinal <b>meningocele</b> is rare and is generally described in the thoracic or sacral region. These frequently occur as a manifesta-tion of generalized mesenchymal dysplasia such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF- 1) or Marfan syndrome and rarely as an isolated defect. We report the imag...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Lumbo-peritoneal shunt {{was used}} as an {{alternative}} treatment in a large anterior sacral <b>meningocele,</b> a rare congenital malformation, is illustrated. Clinical Presentation: A 48 -year-old female patient presented with a two-month history of progressive paraparesis, leg pain and numbness of both legs. The investigation demonstrated spina bifida with a huge sac of <b>meningocele,</b> protruding anteriorly into the pelvic cavity. On two previous surgical operations for closure, the fistula through the posterior transsacral approach failed 20 years ago at another hospital, but her symptoms had subsided spontaneously without explanation. She came to Thammmasat Hospital with an episode of spinal cord compression for 2 months. Management: Because of the old surgical scar and high pressure of the <b>meningocele,</b> a lumbo-peritoneal shunt was selected to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the <b>meningocele</b> to the peritoneal cavity. Conclusion: Lumbo-peritoneal shunting is an optional treatment for a large sacral <b>meningocele,</b> especially in a large fistula with unsuccessful surgical closure...|$|E
