50|$|YIG {{multipliers}} often want {{to select}} an arbitrary harmonic, so {{they use a}} stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates {{an infinite number of}} (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a <b>monostable</b> <b>circuit</b> will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using step recovery diodes may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic.|$|E

40|$|The Anti Collision {{device is}} a {{detection}} device {{meant to be}} incorporated into cars {{for the purpose of}} safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The device is intended {{to find a way to}} implement a minimum spacing for cars in traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver. Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers. To achieve this design, 555 timers coupled both as astable and <b>monostable</b> <b>circuits</b> were used along with a 38 KHz Square Pulse generator. The device works by sending out streams of infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle, both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared beams. At the end of the design and testing process, overall system was implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures, Journal pape...|$|R

40|$|For {{the solar}} system {{exploration}} and the distant universe study, the in-situ particle energy measurement and/or the electron/ion event detection are needed. For our on-board satellite application, the particle sensor {{that is used to}} convert particle momentum into measurable electrical charges is a Microchannel plate (MCP). The performances of such a sensor depend on the Analog-Front-End (AFE) circuit used to process the incoming charges. Consequently, a CMOS instrumentation chain for charged particle detection has been designed and tested under space environment. This AFE contains 16 channels, all of which includes a charge pre-amplifier (CPA), a pulse shaper (PS) and a <b>monostable</b> <b>circuit</b> to perform the detection. Using a standard 0. 35 µm CMOS process, the proposed AFE has a conversion gain of 0. 9 mV/fC for electrons and a power consumption of 2. 15 mW per channel. Its dynamic range is 79 dB and it is possible to convert charges up to 1. 5 pC. The circuit works properly from- 20 to 80 °C with a measured analog gain variation of 1 µV. fC- 1. K- 1. As far as crosstalk is concerned, experiments show that the proposed instrumentation chain can detect negative charges down to 122 fC without any ambiguity. Further, the proposed chain was irradiated at an average rate of 140 rads (Si) per hour up to 360 krad without any functionality loss...|$|E
40|$|Monostable multivibrators have {{attracted}} some {{attention in the}} progressive industry of electronics because of its promising use.

40|$|Toward the {{development}} of a measurement system for transonic compressor rotors, the static pressure field over a high-speed test rotor was recorded using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and an electronically-gated, intensified CCD video camera and frame-grabber. Semi-conductor digital logic circuits were developed to form a phase-locked image capture system which acquired ultra-high-speed, low-light-level gated images once per revolution (1 /Rev). A <b>monostable</b> pulse <b>circuit</b> was developed to sum more than 200 gated images over a one-second integration period to build a single image. Rotor speed was measured on an oscilloscope using the 1 /Rev trigger-pulse. Also, a pressure vessel was constructed and used to calibrate the PSP over varying pressure and temperature ranges to yield qualitative image intensity versus pressure data. Finally, the static pressure field data over the rotor surface was measured and presented as a 256 grey-scale and color image. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
40|$|Biomolecular {{circuits}} {{with two}} distinct and stable steady {{states have been}} identified as essential components {{in a wide range of}} biological networks, with a variety of mechanisms and topologies giving rise to their important bistable property. Understanding the differences between circuit implementations is an important question, particularly for the synthetic biologist faced with determining which bistable circuit design out of many is best for their specific application. In this work we explore the applicability of Sturm's theorem—a tool from nineteenth-century real algebraic geometry—to comparing ‘functionally equivalent’ bistable circuits without the need for numerical simulation. We first consider two genetic toggle variants and two different positive feedback circuits, and show how specific topological properties present in each type of circuit can serve to increase the size of the regions of parameter space in which they function as switches. We then demonstrate that a single competitive monomeric activator added to a purely monomeric (and otherwise <b>monostable)</b> mutual repressor <b>circuit</b> is sufficient for bistability. Finally, we compare our approach with the Routh–Hurwitz method and derive consistent, yet more powerful, parametric conditions. The predictive power and ease of use of Sturm's theorem demonstrated in this work suggest that algebraic geometric techniques may be underused in biomolecular circuit analysis...|$|R
