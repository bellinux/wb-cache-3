40|$|We {{evaluate}} the percolation threshold values for a realistic model of continuum segregated systems, where random spherical inclusions forbid the percolating objects, modellized by hard-core spherical particles surrounded by penetrable shells, to occupy large regions inside the composite. We {{find that the}} percolation threshold is generally a non-monotonous function of segregation, and that an optimal (i. e., <b>minimum)</b> <b>critical</b> <b>concentration</b> exists well before maximum segregation is reached. We interpret this feature as originating from a competition between reduced available volume effects and enhanced concentrations needed to ensure percolation in the highly segregated regime.

This method was quite precise and reproducible when temperature, pH, nutrient concentration and Al concentration of the solutions were rigidly controlled. The severity of toxicity was sharply increased by decreasing the concentrations of nutrients in the Al treatment solutions. Four wheat varieties of widely differing tolerance to Al all behaved similarly in this respect suggesting that tolerance is a relative rather than an absolute varietal characteristic. The critical Al concentrations for four classes of tolerance were determined and the conditions for separating these classes by a rapid, precise, and convenient screening procedure was developed. The inhibition of root growth by Al could be completely overcome in all four varieties by increasing the Ca, Mg, K, or Na concentration in the Al treatment solutions.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that {{modification}} with strontium causes an increase in the size of eutectic grains. The eutectic grain size increases because there are fewer nucleation events, possibly due to the poisoning of phosphorus-based nuclei that are active in the unmodified alloy. The current paper investigates the effect of strontium concentration on the eutectic grain size. In the aluminium- 10 wt. % silicon alloy used in this research, for fixed casting conditions, the eutectic grain size increases as the strontium concentration increases up to approximately 150 ppm, beyond which the grain size is relatively stable. This <b>critical</b> strontium <b>concentration</b> is likely to differ depending on the composition of the base alloy, including the concentration of minor elements and impurities. It is concluded that processing and in-service properties of strontium modified aluminium-silicon castings are likely to be more stable if a <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> strontium <b>concentration</b> is exceeded. If operating below this <b>critical</b> strontium <b>concentration</b> exceptional control over composition and casting conditions is required. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{pharmacokinetic}} model (IVPM) and a mouse model of lethal bacteremia {{were used to}} compare the pharmacodynamics of ampicillin-sulbactam when the two components were dosed simultaneously and in sequence against TEM- 1 -producing Escherichia coli. The challenge isolates included three strains of E. coli producing various levels of beta-lactamase. Human pharmacokinetics of ampicillin-sulbactam (1. 5 - and 3. 0 -g intravenous doses) were simulated in each model, and pharmacodynamic interactions were evaluated over one 6 -h dosing interval. Against all three strains, the sequential dosing of sulbactam prior to ampicillin did not alter the pharmacodynamics of these combinations from comparison with results obtained with the simultaneous administration of the two components. Similar pharmacodynamics were observed for the two dosing regimens regardless of the ampicillin-sulbactam dose used or whether the bacteria were treated in an immunocompetent mouse or in the absence of immune defenses in the IVPM. When antibacterial activity was lost and regrowth of the inoculum was observed, viable bacterial counts increased in both the simultaneous and sequential regimens at a point when sulbactam levels fell below a critical concentration. These data suggest that the efficacy of ampicillin-sulbactam is not dependent upon the maintenance of a constant 2 : 1 ratio for the two components. Rather, the efficacy of ampicillin-sulbactam appears to be dependent upon the maintenance of one or both components above a critical concentration. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of sulbactam, specifically, how long sulbactam levels remain above a <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>concentration,</b> appears to dictate how long antibacterial activity is maintained with the combination...|$|E

The tank {{contains}} a significant quantity of fissile materials, including an estimated 9. 782 kg of plutonium. Before beginning jet pump mixing for mitigative purposes, the operations must be evaluated to demonstrate {{that they will be}} subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions. The main objective {{of this study was to}} address a concern about whether two 300 -hp pumps with four rotating 18. 3 -m/s (60 -ft/s) jets can concentrate plutonium in their pump housings during mixer pump operation and cause a criticality. The three-dimensional simulation was performed with the time-varying TEMPEST code to determine how much the pump jet mixing of Tank AZ- 101 will concentrate plutonium in the pump housing. The AZ- 101 model predicted that the total amount of plutonium within the pump housing peaks at 75 g at 10 simulation seconds and decreases to less than 10 g at four minutes. The plutonium concentration in the entire pump housing peaks at 0. 60 g/L at 10 simulation seconds and is reduced to below 0. 1 g/L after four minutes. Since the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>concentration</b> of plutonium is 2. 6 g/L, and the minimum critical plutonium mass under idealized plutonium-water conditions is 520 g, these predicted maximums in the pump housing are much lower than the minimum plutonium conditions needed to reach a criticality level.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of a solvent or a solvent system is a fundamental and a crucial step in spinning fibres using a selected process. Solvent selection determines the <b>critical</b> <b>minimum</b> polymer <b>concentration</b> and the <b>critical</b> <b>minimum</b> chain entanglement which allows the spinning of nanofibres rather than other hybrid morphologies such as beaded structures. Pressurised gyration, which simultaneously combines the use of gas pressure and rotation, is used as the processing and forming route for spinning fibres in this work. This study investigates 23 different solvents and solvent systems spread on a wide area of a Teas graph and able to dissolve the functional polymer polyethylene (terephthalate) (PET) and spin products by the application of pressurised gyration. The results are mapped on a Teas graph to identify the solubility–spinnability region. Based on this solubility–spinnability region, various solvents and binary solvent systems that allow the making of PET fibres are suggested. Scaling laws {{for the relationship between}} polymer concentration and specific viscosity are identified. The structural evolution in the fibres prepared is elucidated. For the first time, a mathematical model to scale fibre diameter with respect to flow properties and processing parameters encountered in pressurised gyration has been successfully developed...|$|R

A fit to the calculated <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass data using the extended criticality parameter {{is the basis of}} the revised method. The solution density (grams/ liter) for the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass is also obtained by a fit to calculated values. Input to the calculation consists of the Maxwellian averaged fission and absorption cross sections and the thermal values of nubar. The revised method gives more accurate values than the original method does for both the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass and the solution densities. The OB- 1 method has been extended to calculate the uncertainties in the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass for 12 different fissile nuclides. The uncertainties for the fission and capture cross sections and the estimated nubar uncertainties are used to determine the uncertainties in the mini-mum critical mass, either in percent or grams.
