5000|$|Syndesmosis {{procedure}} addresses {{specifically the}} two fundamental problems of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> deformity that {{gives rise to}} the bunion deformity. They are leaning and instability of the first metatarsal bone [...] Syndesmosis procedure uprights the leaning first metatarsal bone with strong binding sutures between it and the second metatarsal bone (Fig. 2) and then also stabilizes it uniquely by creating a fibrous connecting bridge between these two bones (Fig. 3,4). First metatarsal bone can be readily realigned is because by definition of the <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> deformity its first metatarsal is abnormally loose and mobile.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hallux valgus and <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> defor-mities {{usually are}} the result of failure of the {{supporting}} soft tissues rather than bone deformities. Since soft-tissue proce-dures have been shown to only be suitable for mild deformi-ties, first metatarsal osteotomy has {{become an integral part of}} correcting moderate to severe deformities. A soft-tissue tech-nique referred to as the “syndesmosis procedure ” by the author was evaluated for its effectiveness in correcting <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> in feet with hallux valgus. Methods: This is a retrospective clinical and radiographic study of six patients (11 feet) an average of 6 years and 10 months after the “syndesmosis procedure. ” A cerclage technique using absorbable suture (PDS) was used for the first metatarsal realignment, and its long-term maintenance depended on a syndesmosis (fibrous) bonding between the first and second metatarsal bases. Results: The average preoperative hallux valgus angle of 29. 5 (21 to 43) degrees improved to 13. 5 (− 2 to 24) degrees and the average preoperative <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> angle of 13. 6 (12 to 16) degrees improved to 5. 2 (2 to 8) degrees at an average of 85. 7 (33 to 128) months. All patients were satisfied with their results and were able to return to sports and wearing high-heeled shoes as desired. Complications were few and mild. Followup American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux scores averaged 93 points. Conclusions: This small but long-term retro-spective study showed encouraging results for the correction of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> deformity and a high patient satisfac-tion...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to reduce}} {{surgical}} approach {{and to ensure}} early weight bearing postoperatively. Material and method: by the example of 24 surgeries {{the results of the}} 1 st MTCJ arthrodesis percutaneous modification, proposed by the author, were reviewed with the mean follow-up of 6 months. Surgical technique was described. 1 st MTCJ hypermobility, severe <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> and previous surgeries failures were the indications for surgery. Immediate ambulation with one crutch and fool weight bearing since the 4 - 5 th week postoperatively were authorized. Results: desired correction of the first metatarsal was achieved during 23 interventions. Arthrodesis had fused in 21 of 23 cases that were followed up. Two cases of non-union did not require reoperation. No infectious complications were noted. 21 patients were discharged the next day after surgery due to painless early postoperative period. Conclusions: percutaneous 1 st MTCJ arthrodesis is a safe and predictable procedure.

30|$|Hallux valgus is {{a common}} {{condition}} and {{has been reported to}} affect up to 36  % of the paediatric population [1]. The exact aetiology of adolescent hallux valgus (AHV) is unknown, but several features have been identified as possible predisposing factors to its development. These include a positive family history (usually maternal), female gender, pes planus, a relatively long first metatarsal, constrictive footwear and <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> [2, 3].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to expand the {{possibilities}} of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> percutaneous correction through the development of surgical technique, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of known techniques. Materials and method: by the example of 67 surgeries the results of the first metatarsal displaced distal percutaneous osteotomy fixed by the screw were reviewed. Surgical technique was described. Proposed intervention was applicable over a wide range of the first intermetatarsal angle (from 12 to 29 ° in this series). Immediate fool weight-bearing was authorized. An average hospital stay was 1. 02 due to the painless early postoperative period. Results: desired correction of the first metatarsal has been achieved in the course of all surgical interventions. Partial or complete loss of correction in the postoperative period, that did not affect final results, was registered in three patients after interventions on four feet. The average first intermetatarsal angle after surgery was 10. 6 ° (4 - 16). No transfer metatarsalgia, infectious or other complications were noted, as well as unsatisfactory results.

Specific patient exclusion criteria were as follows: a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis, hallux rigidus (defined as less than 10 ° first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion), postoperative follow-up period of less than 12  months, or lack of preoperative and final follow-up radiographs in medical record.|$|R
40|$|The {{aetiology}} {{and form}} of hallux valgus (HV) is varied with many corrective procedures described. We report a 39 -year-old woman, previously {{treated with a}} Chevron osteotomy, who presented with recurrent right HV, <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus,</b> and associated bunion. Osteotomies were performed at two levels as a revisional procedure. This report highlights (1) limitations of the Chevron osteotomy and (2) the revisional procedure of the two level osteotomies: (i) proximal opening-wedge basal osteotomy and (ii) distal short Scarf with medial closing wedges. If a Chevron osteotomy is used inappropriately, for example, {{in an attempt to}} correct too large a deformity, it may angulate laterally causing a malunion with an increased distal metatarsal articular angle.

Ten feet in nine patients (two males, seven females) were treated surgically with the Peterson Newman bunion procedure, with a minimum follow‑up of one year. During the final follow‑up all these patients had no complaints of pain, joint stiffness or limping. Even though the patients had some mild loss of range of movements at the MTP joints 4 – 6 ° compared to preoperative value, it did not cause any functional impairment and all {{were satisfied with the}} final outcome.

30|$|Several {{methods to}} define the {{position}} of the sesamoid have been described [22 – 25], including the one proposed by Mann used in this study [23]. The position of the tibial sesamoid on the anteroposterior radiograph was described as medial, lateral, or central in relation to a line drawn along the center of the longitudinal axis of the first metatarsal. The first metatarsal head is bisected, and the sesamoid is divided into quarters. The position of the tibial sesamoid was considered to be medial if 75 % of its width was medial to the central line, and lateral if 75 % was lateral to the central line; otherwise, the sesamoid was considered to be centrally located. According to Mann, sesamoid position does not affect the severity and frequency of postoperative pain. In our study, the late postoperative medial or central sesamoid position of 88.9 % demonstrates that the aim of correcting <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> was achieved.|$|R
40|$|Seventy-eight chevron osteotomies {{augmented}} by internal fixation with self-reinforced polyglycolide pins, 2 mm in diameter, were performed in 60 patients {{suffering from a}} painful hallux valgus. The mean metatarsophalangeal an-gle was 31 °, {{and there was a}} <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> varying from loo to 20 ". The average follow-up time was 14 (range, 12 to 31) months. No postoperative redisplace-ment or disturbance of healing of the osteotomy was observed, but recurrence of hallux valgus occurred in 8 feet (lo%), each initially with a moderate to severe hallux valgus. Some pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint during physical activity remained in 12 feet (15 %). There was a mean shortening of 2. 5 mm of the first metatarsal bone, and the most significant shortening was associated with pain in the forefoot. The metatarsophalangeal joint motion was not decreased. The subjective overall result was excellent or good in 75 Oh of the patients. Because of the biodegradability of the implants used, no secondary procedures to remove the implants were necessary...|$|R
30|$|Recurrence of {{hallux valgus}} of 72.2 %, {{which is quite}} high, was {{observed}} in this study, with 15 ° accepted as the upper limit. The {{most common cause of}} recurrence in McBride procedure is insufficient attention to the <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> [1]. Treatment of a fixed bony deformity using a soft tissue procedure leads to insufficiency in many cases. Because of this, bony procedures should be added to the DSTP whenever needed, otherwise high recurrence may be inevitable as seen in our cases. In one study [7], recurrence was reported in 40 of 72 cases (56 %). The authors claimed this {{to be the result of}} weakness of medial joint structures, insufficiency of lateral release, pressure of the proximal phalanx on the metatarsal head, and rigidity of the 1.MTC. Dreeben and Mann [17] reported three recurrences in 39 cases. Patient compliance plays an important role in recurrence [16], and while the results of revision surgery, such as the modified McBride procedure with proximal crescentic osteotomy [16] or resection arthroplasty with arthrodesis [14], may be accepted as sufficient, they are not as good as those obtained following primary surgery.|$|R
40|$|Proximal crescentic {{metatarsal}} osteotomy is a clinically successful {{technique for}} correcting <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> in hallux valgus surgery. However, {{there have been}} instances of dorsal elevation of the metatarsal head with this technique. Mechanical testing on 10 matched pairs of cadaver feet was performed to evaluate a new tech-nique combining a biplanar closing wedge osteotomy and plantar plate fixation versus crescentic metatarsal osteotomy. The specimens were tested in cantilever-bending mode on an MTS Mini Bionix test frame. The mean load-to-failure values were 127. 2 ± 81. 9 N (SO) for biplanar osteotomy with plate fixation and 44. 9 ± 43. 3 N for crescentic osteotomy (P = 0. 019); the mean stiffness values at the initial portion of the load-deflection curve were 83. 11 ± 73. 76 N/mm and 31. 95 ± 43. 00 N/mm, respectively (P = 0. 012). The biplanar wedge osteotomy with plantar plate fixation demonstrated significantly stronger fixation than the crescentic osteotomy, with higher mean load-to-failure and stiffness values. This newly described technique may provide an acceptable alternative for patients at risk for dorsal elevation of the metatarsal, particularly those who are noncompliant or have osteopenia. Clinical study will determine whether this new technique offers satisfactory long-term results...|$|R
40|$|Hypermobility of {{the first}} ray is {{suggested}} to contribute to hallux valgus. The investigation of first ray hypermobility focused on the mobility and range of motion that based on manual examination. The load transfer mechanism {{of the first}} ray {{is important to understand}} the development and pathomechanism of hallux valgus. In this study, we investigated the immediate effect of the joint hypermobility on the metatarsocuneiform and metatarsophalangeal joint loading through a reduction of the stiffness of the foot ligaments. A three-dimensional foot model was constructed from a female aged 28 via MRI. All foot and ankle bones, including two sesamoids and the encapsulated bulk tissue were modeled as 3 D solid parts, linking with ligaments of shell elements and muscles connectors. The stance phase of walking was simulated by the boundary and loading conditions obtained from gait analysis of the same subject. Compared with the normal foot, the hypermobile foot had higher resultant metatarsocuneiform and metatarsophalangeal joint forces. The increases accounted for 18. 6 % and 3. 9 % body weight. There was also an abrupt change of metatarsocuneiform joint force in the medial-lateral direction.

40|$|From a {{total of}} 138 {{patients}} who initially underwent either Chevron or Mitchell distal metatarsal osteotomies, 50 were available with complete pre- and postoperative data for study. Chevron osteotomies were performed on 60 feet (41 patients) and Mitchell osteotomies on 12 (nine patients). The results indicate that both procedures provide good or excellent subjective and objective results in about 90 % of cases. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the procedures as regards the results. Age did not influence the outcome. Complications included damage to the proper digital nerve of the great toe in 30 % indicating either direct injury to the nerve with subsequent neuroma formation or indirect injury by nerve entrapment. Osteonecrosis of the first metatarsal head occurred following Chevron osteotomies in 12 feet (12 of 60 or 20 %) and following a Mitchell in one (one of 12 or 8 %). However, four of the 10 (40 %) patients who had a Chevron osteotomy plus a lateral adductor release developed osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis is described and classified into three stages: stage I, the precollapse condition; stage II, the collapsed condition; and stage III, the osteoarthritic condition. The major causes of failure were preexisting osteoarthritis, injury to the dorsal proper digital nerve, and osteonecrosis. Theoretically, most of these should be avoidable. Significant <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> and MTP osteoarthritis are contraindications to distal metatarsal osteotomies.

The purpose of this paper is to report two very rare cases of spontaneous hallux varus occurring in late adulthood. The first case, which was unilateral, oc-curred at the age of 72 years. The patient had a history of childhood poliomyelitis involving this ex-tremity. The second patient developed bilateral hallux varus at the age of 59 years. X-rays revealed bilateral congenital absence of the fibular sesamoids. CASE 1 The patient, a 74 -year-old female, complained of pain and stiffness of her left ankle. She also noted a painless left sided hallux varus deformity developing 2 years ago. The patient is a diabetic. She gave a history of contracting poliomyelitis in childhood. Two operations were performed, one, a heel cord lenthen-ing, 52 years ago, for an equinus deformity and the second, a triple arthrodesis, performed 50 years ago. Physical examination revealed severe valgus of her left foot with evidence of a triple arthrodesis. There was hammering of the second through the fifth toes and a painfully stiff ankle. There was a severe, but flexible, hallux varus (Fig. 1 A). The right foot was splayed associated with a bunion, hallux valgus, and <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> deformities.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} analysis of most first metatarsal oste-otomy corrections for <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> is pre-sented and interpreted {{with respect to}} metatarsal length-ening or shortening and changes in clinical reference angles (e. g., intermetatarsal or angle of declination). The critical parameters for each osteotomy such as location and angles of cuts and amount of displacement are de-fined and their theoretical effects on the final correction determined. Although exactitude in surgical methodology and an absolute prediction of final clinical results are impossible at the present time, even guidelines as to the potential effectiveness of various surgical techniques and quantitative methods for subsequent evaluation are lack-ing. This {{mathematical analysis}} can provide guidelines for prospective choices and a basis for retrospective inter-pretation as well as represent a critical component for biomechanical calculations.

40|$|Pronation of {{the foot}} is {{proposed}} as a possible aetiological factor in hallux valgus. Root type foot orthoses {{have been shown to}} restrict foot pronation and therefore have been used to treat hallux valgus. A controlled prospective 3 year trial tested the value of a Root foot orthosis in the treatment of juvenile hallux valgus. Six thousand nine year old Kettering children were screened for hallux valgus using goniometric and clinical examination. A clinical diagnosis of hallux valgus was made in 150 children and confirmed using radiography in 122 cases. Pes planus was as common in children with hallux valgus as children with no hallux valgus. The biomechanical examination of hallux valgus children revealed that a plantarflexed first metatarsal was the only consistent biomechanical abnormality. The sagittal plane position of the first metatarsal did not however relate to the degree of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> which is apparent in the unaffected feet of children with unilateral hallux valgus prior to the development of hallux valgus in both feet. The 122 children with hallux valgus were randomised into a non-treatment control group and a treatment group where Root foot orthoses were worn for three years. Compliance and fit of the orthoses were checked every 4 to 6 months. At the end of the 3 year period, 96 children underwent a second weight bearing radiograph of both feet. The same observer measured the intermetatarsal and hallux valgus angle on all radiographs. The hallux valgus had deteriorated significantly in both the control and treatment group. Though not statistically significant, the deterioration was slightly more marked in the treatment group. A Root foot orthosis prescribed to restrict foot pronation will not significantly alter the progression of juvenile hallux valgus.

In I 952 Duncan McKeever described a method of arthrodesing this joint, by means of a screwinserted across the excised joint, the head of the screw lying under the proximal phalanx, the screwitself occupying the whole of the medulla of the metatarsal shaft. He appeared to be wholly satisfied with the results, but patients who havehad this type of fusion have, on occasion, com-plained of pain over the screw head on walking, with loss of the efficient functioning of the longflexor of the toe, an all-important factor in securing a satisfactory gait. In addition, the presence of the metallic foreign body in the metatarsal shaft has on one occasion provoked abony reaction with periosteal new bone formation, and cavitation of the metatarsal, accompanied by severe pain. These complications have necessitated removal of the screw, a task which is not always simple and which subjects the patient to a second opera-tive procedure. The method of fusion to be described obviates these complications.

40|$|<b>Metatarsus</b> <b>primus</b> <b>varus</b> {{deformity}} correction {{is one of}} {{the main}} objectives in hallux valgus surgery. A ‘syndesmosis’ procedure may be used to correct hallux valgus. An osteotomy is not involved. The aim is to realign the first metatarsal using soft tissues and a cerclage wire around the necks of the first and second metatarsals. We have retrospectively assessed 27 patients (54 feet) using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, radiographs and measurements of the plantar pressures after bilateral syndesmosis procedures. There were 26 women. The mean age of the patients was 46 years (18 to 70) and the mean follow-up was 26. 4 months (24 to 33. 4). Matched-pair comparisons of the AOFAS scores, the radiological parameters and the plantar pressure measurements were conducted pre- and post-operatively, with the mean of the left and right feet. The mean AOFAS score improved from 62. 8 to 94. 4 points (p < 0. 001). Significant differences were found on all radiological parameters (p < 0. 001). The mean hallux valgus and first intermetatarsal angles were reduced from 33. 2 ° (24. 3 ° to 49. 8 °) to 19. 1 ° (10. 1 ° to 45. 3 °) (p < 0. 001) and from 15. 0 ° (10. 2 ° to 18. 6 °) to 7. 2 ° (4. 2 ° to 11. 4 °) (p < 0. 001) respectively. The mean medial sesamoid position changed from 6. 3 (4. 5 to 7) to 3. 6 (2 to 7) (p < 0. 001) according to the Hardy’s scale (0 to 7). The mean maximum force and the force–time integral under the hallux region were significantly increased by 71. 1 % (p = 0. 001), (20. 57 (0. 08 to 58. 3) to 35. 20 (6. 63 to 67. 48)) and 73. 4 % (p = 0. 014), (4. 44 (0. 00 to 22. 74) to 7. 70 (1. 28 to 19. 23)) respectively. The occurrence of the maximum force under the hallux region was delayed by 11 % (p = 0. 02), (87. 3 % stance (36. 3 % to 100 %) to 96. 8 % stance (93. 0 % to 100 %)). The force data reflected the restoration of the function of the hallux. Three patients suffered a stress fracture of the neck of the second metatarsal. The short-term results of this surgical procedure for the treatment of hallux valgus are satisfactory. Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R
30|$|The {{cardinal}} {{challenge in}} questionnaire-based studies is {{the identification of}} the patients. In the present study on congenital clubfoot we consider this to be a reliable method, since this distinct disorder is not easily overlooked or mistaken for other frequent disorders. However, some patients may have other foot deformities such as <b>metatarsus</b> <b>varus,</b> pes cavus, etc. The treatment of clubfoot in these cohorts was splinting and/or operation. The final results of the treatment were inferior to the present-day Ponseti technique. We do not expect patients to be unaware of having had clubfoot, however well corrected. Less than 50  % of clubfeet will be corrected in one operation, around 80  % in two operations, and approximately 90  % after three operations [30]. Long-term follow-up after surgical correction indicates that many patients suffer from pain, limping, and overall reduced foot function [31].|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: First-ray metatarsophalangeal {{arthrodesis}} is {{a classic}} surgical procedure {{in the treatment of}} severe hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, revision surgery, and inflammatory arthritis. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify if metatarsophalangeal plate arthrodesis could correct the M 1 M 2 intermetatarsal angle. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective and continuous series (June 2007 to March 2011) included 208 patients (48 % severe and/or arthritic hallux valgus, 18 % hallux rigidus, 16 % rheumatoid forefoot, 13 % surgical revision of the first ray, 5 % hallux varus), with a mean age of 62. 4 ± 9. 9 years (range, 19 - 87 years). All the patients were operated on by a senior surgeon with the same technique: spherical avivement of the joint surfaces using reamers, osteosynthesis with an anatomic plate (Fyxis-BiotechTM) in Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy prebent to 5 ° with a phalangeal arm to receive an oblique metatarsophalangeal screw in compression, in addition to four 2. 7 -mm nonlocking dorsal screws. The full-scale preoperative and intraoperative angle measurements were taken on AP and lateral X-rays of the weightbearing foot, as related to the etiology and the severity of the preoperative <b>metatarsus</b> <b>varus</b> (M 1 M...|$|R
40|$|From an {{investigation}} on 400 constitutional {{diseases of the}} skeleton foot deformities occur with a frequency of 18 %. The most common deformity is represented by congenital clubfoot (14. 7 %), syndactyly (14. 50 %), brachydactyly (11 %); follow the congenital flat foot (8. 75 %), Polydactyly (6. 25 %) and oligoectrodactyly (4. 50 %); unusual finding of congenital <b>metatarsus</b> <b>varus</b> (3. 75 %), congenital hallux valgus (2. 00 %) and hammer toe (2 %); rare congenital talipes (1. 75 %), congenital hollow foot (1. 25 %) and congenital hallux varus (1. 25 %); very rare macrodactily (0. 75 %) and clinodactyly of the fifth finger (0. 75 %). The majority of diseases that are {{the basis of the}} deformities of the foot above are of genetic origin; they recognize an autosomal recessive trans 4 ission in the 41. 12 % and dominant in the 31. 67 %; a dominant X-linked transmission in 4. 72 % and recessive X-linked in 1. 45 %; finally, they are transmitted in different ways with both dominant and recessive in the 7. 88 % of cases; forms of genetic origin are therefore 86. 84 % of all cases. 7 % is represented by chromosome aberrations and the remaining by embryo-fetopathy or disease of unknown etiology...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{below the}} knee {{amputation}} specimens were ex-amined while a dorsally directed force {{was applied to the}} first metatarsal. Seven specimens were tested with serial removal of soft tissues, followed by cutting the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament. Five specimens had only the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament cut, leaving the other structures intact. In both groups, dorsal displacement of the distal first metatarsal was noted to be more than 5 mm after sectioning of the ligament, with no marked change noted during removal of other soft tissues. This study demonstrates that the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament is the major component in the stabilization of the first metatarsal during weightbear-ing. The importance of the first metatarsal in weightbear-ing has long been appreciated, and dorsal displacement of the distal first metatarsal has been noted previously as the source of increased lateral weightbearing and subsequent metatarsal pain. 2, 5, 7, 13, 15 This has usually been {{as a result of a}} displaced or angulated metatarsal fracture, or malunion of an osteotomy of the first meta-tarsal. Surgical procedures have been done to restore the weightbearing role of the distal first metatarsal, including first metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis, and osteotomies to restore the first metatarsal to its previous weightbearing position. First metatarsocunei-form joint arthrodesis has been reported on by Kwong and Aubauchon, " as well as by Mauldin et al., " for relief of metatarsalgia as well as <b>metatarsus</b> <b>varus.</b> The purpose of this study was to explore the normal ana-tomic structures providing support to the first metatar-sal during its weightbearing function...|$|R
40|$|Background: In a {{continuous}} series of 54 MTP- 1 arthrodeses using ball and cup reamers, fusion and great toe position were analyzed. Materials and methods: The population was mainly female (46 versus 8). Mean age at operation was 61 years. Arthrodesis was for four conditions of symptomatic degenerative disease: 36 severe hallux valgus (> 358), 7 recurrences of hallux valgus, 9 hallux rigidus and 2 hallux varus. Arthrodesis used a medial approach, articular surface preparation by ball and cup reamers (plus perforation by Kirschner wire), and osteosynthesis with three titanium staples. Pre- and postoperative big toe positions were analysed with the FootlogTM semi-automated X-ray assessment software. Results: All patients were followed {{up for a}} mean 38. 6 months (22 - 56). Overall fusion rate was 94. 4 %, and 99 % for primary arthrodesis. Mean time to union was 56 days (74 % in 6 weeks), with 3 non-unions (5. 6 %), including 2 after hallux valgus recurrence. Mean pre-operative toe valgus was 408 and 14. 18 at revision for all groups. 95 % of arthrodeses fused at a mean lateral metatarsophalangeal angle of 22. 6 (18 - 268). <b>Metatarsus</b> <b>varus</b> exceeded 208 in 8 cases, mainly in the severe hallux valgus group; at revision, the mean first intermetatarsal angle was 10. 68 (9 - 128). Conclusion: Arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with ball and cup reamers is a reliable and reproducible technique, giving total correction of big toe valgus. The first intermetatarsal angle was corrected without supplementary osteotomy. Using three pure titanium staples for fixation, rate and time of fusion were in line with reference techniques...|$|R
