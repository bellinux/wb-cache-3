5000|$|Certain {{materials}} are ubiquitous in Guerlain’s work: high quality citruses (bergamot, citron, mandarin, sweet and bitter orange), coumarin, floral absolutes (cassie, jasmine, rose, orange blossom), green notes (galbanum), violet-smelling ionones and fine qualities of orris, vanilla and ylang-ylang. He had {{a fondness for}} aromatic spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, croton, nutmeg) and certain herbes de Provence (absinthe, angelica, basil, bay leaf, caraway, coriander, cumin, tarragon). He was a specialist on aromatic resins (benzoin, labdanum); indeed he used opoponax in most of his formulae, sometimes in mere trace quantities - imperceptible {{in and of itself}} though lending to the overall texture of the perfume. His base notes often consisted of strong artificial musks (musk ketone, <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette,</b> musk xylene), which he favored greatly. As to ambergris, according to a supplier, Guerlain would say, [...] "You sell this product at a shameful price; it smells of almost nothing, but my clients stop liking my perfumes when I put none in." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>ambrette,</b> {{a contact}} and photocontact allergen, is a {{synthetic}} fragrance present in aftershave lotions and many toiletries. Thirty-four patients with contact and photocontact allergy to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> were studied. All had a facial eczema. Four distinctive clinical pictures were seen. These were plaques of eczema, jawline (mandibular) dermatitis, acute contact dermatitis and chronic actinic dermatitis. Twenty-six patients were light sensitive by history and 10 were diagnosed by clinical criteria as having chronic actinic dermatitis. Patch and photopatch testing to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> showed that seven patients had pure photocontact dermatitis to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette.</b> Eight patients had contact dermatitis to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> {{but this was}} exacerbated by irradiation. Cross reaction with moskene occurred. Scrupulous avoidance of <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> has resulted in clinical resolution in most patients...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{induction}} of contact photodermatitis to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette,</b> 2 -methoxy- 3, 5 -dinitro- 4 -methyl-t-butylbenzene, in guinea pigs. Photoallergic contact dermatitis was assayed using 2 alternative induction methods. Successful photosensitization was achieved {{only when the}} nuchal skin was stripped with scotch tape before application of <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> and ultraviolet radiation. Induction methods utilizing non-stripped nuchal skin which induce photosensitivity to potent photoallergens were ineffective for <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette.</b> Phototoxicity tests to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> at concentrations between 1 and 50 % and a dose of 10. 2 joules/cm 2 from “Black Light” fluorescent tubes were all negative. Under identical irradiation conditions, anthracene at 0. 9 % and 8 -methoxypsoralen at 1 % were consistently positive. The mechanism of photosensitivity to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> appears to be photoallergic rather than phototoxic. The requirement for skin abrasion to induce photosensitization parallels the clinical reports of photosensitivity to <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> in man...|$|E

40|$|Natural musk (muscone) is {{a highly}} prized natural product for use in {{expensive}} consumer fragrances. Inexpensive synthetic substitutes have been commercialized over the last 40 years. Two main chemical classes are used commercially — the nitro musks (which fulfilled the original demand for inexpensive fragrance additives for personal care products such as bath soap, body lotions, perfumes, and washing detergents) and the newer polycyclic musks which have musklike smell. The commercial nitro musks include musk ketone, musk moskene, <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette,</b> musk xylene, and musk tibetene. The polycyclics include trade named compounds such as Galaxolide®, Tonalide®, Celestolide®, Traseolide®, Phantolide®, and Cashmeran®, among others. These consumer chemicals are manufactured and consumed in very large quantities worldwide. They are volatile, not amenable to normal environmental transformations, and lipophilic-all traits that should ordinarily lead to their being characterized as persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic chemicals (PBTs). 16 Their use leads to their entry into the city sewage systems (presumably from bathing and other washing activities), {{and then into the}} aquatic ecosystem, where they can bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms. Given their lipophilic bioaccumulative nature and possibly worldwide environmental distribution, they have the potential to be regarded as ubiquitous environmental contaminants...|$|E
40|$|Patch and photopatch {{testing was}} {{performed}} on 55 patients with history of photosensitivity using Scandanavian photo patch test antigens obtained from Chemotechnique Diagnostics AB Sweden. The commonest reactions were seen to perfume mix 4 (21. 0 &#x 0025;), PABA 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), promethazine hydrochloride 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), chlorpromazine hydrochloride 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), balsam of peru 2 (10. 52 &#x 0025;), usnic acid, hexachlorophane, <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> and 6 methyl coumarin showed 1 positive reaction each (5. 26 &#x 0025;) suggesting either phototoxicity or photo sensitization. Patch and photo patch test positive reaction suggesting allergic sensitisation was seen to balsam of peru 3 (23. 0 &#x 0025;) perfume mix 3 (23. 0 &#x 0025;) promethazine hydrochloride 2 (15. 3 &#x 0025;) and PABA, 6 methyl coumarin, tribromosalicylanilide, atranorin and wood mix showed positive reaction in one case each (7. 69 &#x 0025;). We conclude that photoxic or photo allergic reaction {{is a problem in}} India and patch photo patch test should be performed in all cases of idiopathic light eruptions to rule out photo sensitisation and in cases where photo sensitivity of exogenous origin is suspected...|$|E
40|$|Summary Background Despite the {{enormous}} increase in sunscreen use, allergic contact (AC) and photoallergic (PA) reactions to ultraviolet (UV) filters are considered rare. Objectives To analyse {{the data from}} 2715 patients who underwent photopatch testing at St John's Institute of Dermatology during the period 1983 ± 98. Methods A retrospective analysis of all positive photopatch test episodes was undertaken with the results retrieved from the environmental dermatology database and further verified with the original archived patch test documentation for each individual patient. Results In 111 patients with positive reactions (4 ´ 1 %), there were 155 AC or PA reactions to allergens in the photopatch test series. Eighty PA reactions were observed in 62 (2 ´ 3 %) patients (32 men and 30 women, age range 28 ± 75 years), with UV filters accounting for 52 positive reactions (65 %), drugs 16 (20 %), <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> 11 (14 %) and the antiseptic trichlorocarbanilide one (1 %). The most common UV filter photoallergen was benzophenone- 3 with 14 positive results, followed by benzophenone- 10 (n 9), isopropyl dibenzoylmethane (n 6), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) (n 5), octyl dimethyl PABA (n 5), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (n 4), isoamyl methoxycinnamate (n 2), ethyl methoxycinnamate (n 2), octyl methoxycinnamate (n 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytes from BALB/c mice photosensitized in vivo to {{tetrachlorosalicylanilide}} (TCSA) {{were investigated}} {{to determine whether}} they could be stimulated to proliferate when cultured with Langerhans cell-enriched cultured epidermal cells (LC-EC) photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA radiation. Cultured LC-EC were photohapten-modified in vitro by irradiation in TCSA-containing medium using a 1000 -watt solar simulator equipped with filters to deliver primarily UVA radiation (320 – 400 nm). Lymphocytes from TCSA-photosensitized mice were incubated with LC-EC that had been treated in vitro with 0. 1 mM TCSA and 2 J/cm 2 UVA radiation (TCSA + UVA). Responder lymphocytes demonstrated a significant increase in their blastogenesis response compared to lymphocytes that were incubated with LC-EC irradiated with UVA prior to treatment with TCSA (UVA/TCSA) or with LC-EC that had received no treatment. Lymphocytes from naive mice or mice photosensitized with <b>musk</b> <b>ambrette</b> (MA) demonstrated a significantly lower response to LC-EC modified with TCSA + UVA, indicating the specificity of the response. Maximum blastogenesis response was achieved when LC-EC were treated with 0. 1 mM TCSA and a UVA radiation dose of at least 0. 5 J/cm 2. Epidermal cells depleted of LC by treatment with anti-Ia antibody plus complement or by an adherence procedure were unable to stimulate this blastogenesis response. Epidermal cells treated in vitro with TOSA + UVA demonstrated enhanced fluorescence compared to control cells. The fluorescence observed was not restricted to any specific epidermal cell type; however, fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that dendritic Ia-positive cells, presumably LC, were also TCSA fluorescent. Flow cytometry showed that Ia-positive epidermal cells demonstrated the greatest UV fluorescence when treated with TCSA + UVA compared, to both cells irradiated with UVA and subsequently treated with TCSA and untreated cells. This is consistent with the enhanced antigen presentation capability of TCSA + UVA treated LC-EC, which leads to the conclusion that LC photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrate enhanced TCSA fluorescence and are capable of stimulating lymphocytes from TCSA photosensitized mice in an antigen-specific manner...|$|E
