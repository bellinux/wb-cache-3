40|$|In {{this work}} a control {{structure}} {{capable of handling}} controllability problems, which emerge from the presence of constraints, and improve {{the performance of the}} system by coordinating the use of several <b>manipulated</b> variables is introduced. In this scheme, the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to handle the transient response while the auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to keep the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable away from saturation. These two <b>manipulated</b> variables are coordinated through a user-defined non-linear function, which decides when and how the control structure changes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} output unreachability under input {{saturation}} phenomenon is studied: under a large disturbance or set-point change, the process output may never reach the set-point {{even when the}} <b>manipulated</b> variable has been driven to saturation. The process output can only be {{brought back to the}} set-point by activating an auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable. A new feedback cooperative control strategy capable of solving such a problem is proposed. In this scheme, the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to handle the transient response while the auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to keep the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable away from the saturation. These two <b>manipulated</b> variables are coordinated through a user-defined non-linear function. This function decides when and how the control structure changes.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. A. thesis. October 2010. Major: Speech-Language pathology. Advisor: Associate Professor Benjamin Munson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 49 pages, appendix p. 49. Ill. (some col.) In {{order to examine}} the contribution of prosodic variables to the intelligibility of foreign-accented speech, this study asked listeners to provide intelligibility ratings of Hindi-accented English sentences that were acoustically <b>manipulated</b> along two parameters: duration (of segments and pauses) and F 0. The <b>manipulated</b> sentences, which reflected typical American English patterns of duration and pitch, were presented to native American English listeners {{in the presence of}} background noise. The findings were that for Hindi-accented English, <b>manipulating</b> F 0 has a greater effect on intelligibility than does <b>manipulating</b> duration. When duration and F 0 were each <b>manipulated</b> separately, both manipulations led to reduced intelligibility. <b>Manipulating</b> F 0 led to a greater detriment in speech intelligibility than <b>manipulating</b> duration. Furthermore, the lowest intelligibility performance of all resulted from sentences where both duration and F 0 had been modified. Even though the prosodic variables were <b>manipulated</b> to be native-like and to therefore enhance intelligibility, these manipulations resulted worse performance on the part of native listeners. Possible reasons for these findings and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>manipulated</b> Instagram photos on {{adolescent}} girls' body image, and whether social comparison tendency moderates this relation. A between-subject experiment was conducted in which 144 girls (14 - 18 years old) were randomly exposed to either original or <b>manipulated</b> (retouched and reshaped) Instagram selfies. Results showed that exposure to <b>manipulated</b> Instagram photos directly led to lower body image. Especially, girls with higher social comparison tendencies were negatively affected by exposure to the <b>manipulated</b> photos. Interestingly, the <b>manipulated</b> photos were rated more positively than the original photos. Although the use of filters and effects was detected, reshaping of the bodies was not noticed very well. Girls in both conditions reported to find the pictures realistic. Results of this study implied that the recent societal concern {{about the effects of}} <b>manipulated</b> photos in social media might be justified, especially for adolescent girls with a higher social comparison tendency...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} an algebraic proof {{system that}} <b>manipulates</b> multilinear arithmetic formulas. We {{show that this}} proof system is fairly strong, even when restricted to multilinear arithmetic formulas of a very small depth. Specifically, we show the following: 1. Algebraic proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 2 multilinear arithmetic formulas polynomially simulate Resolution, Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution (PCR) proofs; 2. Polynomial size proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for the functional pigeonhole principle; 3. Polynomial size proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for Tseitin’s graph tautologies. By known lower bounds, this demonstrates that algebraic proof systems <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas are strictly stronger than Resolution, PC and PCR, and have an exponential gap over bounded-depth Frege for both the functional pigeonhole principle and Tseitin’s graph tautologies. We also illustrate a connection between lower bounds on multilinear proofs and lower bounds on multilinear arithmetic circuits. In particular, we show that (an explicit) superpolynomial size separation between proofs <b>manipulating</b> general arithmetic circuits and proofs <b>manipulating</b> multilinear arithmetic circuits implies a super-polynomial size lower bound on multilinear arithmetic circuits for an explicit family of polynomials...|$|R
40|$|A linearised {{dynamic model}} of a 10 -plate binary {{distillation}} column was obtained by perturbation technique. The control of the column was considered by two methods: one <b>manipulated</b> variable (reflux) control and two <b>manipulated</b> variables (reflux and reboil) control. These methods were studied on an analog computer. In both cases optimal parameters of the controllers were obtained by integral of the square error criterion for disturbances in the feed composition. The effect of interaction in two <b>manipulated</b> variable control was also studied. It was concluded that two <b>manipulated</b> variable control was practical since it ensures reliability {{in the operation of}} the column...|$|R

30|$|Experiment 1 {{indicates}} {{that people have}} some ability to distinguish between original and <b>manipulated</b> real-world photos. People’s ability to correctly identify <b>manipulated</b> photos was better than chance, although not by much. Our data also suggest that locating photo manipulations is a difficult task, even when people correctly indicate that a photo is <b>manipulated.</b> We should note, however, that our study could have underestimated people’s ability to locate manipulations in real-world photos. Recall that subjects were only asked to locate manipulations on photos that they thought were <b>manipulated.</b> It remains possible people {{might be able to}} locate manipulations even if they do not initially think that a photo has been <b>manipulated.</b> We were unable to check this possibility in Experiment 1, so we addressed this issue in Experiment 2 by asking subjects to complete the location task for all photos, regardless of their initial response in the detection task. If subjects did not think that the photo had been <b>manipulated,</b> we asked them to make a guess about which area of the image might have been changed.|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Critical Discourse Studies on 30 October 2015, available online: [URL] there has been interest in examining how language {{is involved in the}} phenomenon of 'manipulation'. This paper suggests that investigators, rather than treating 'manipulation' as an entity, should examine how communicators might engage in discursive acts of <b>manipulating.</b> To this end a distinction is made between <b>manipulating</b> information and <b>manipulating</b> people. Examples of both types, taken from the Portuguese Parliamentary Celebration of the April Revolution of 2004, are examined in depth to show how acts of <b>manipulating</b> can be performed in different ways. By focussing on acts, we show that supposed 'cognitive control' over the audience's minds is not necessarily involved in manipulating; it is shown how investigators can provide evidence that manipulators act 'knowingly' when they mislead. We argue that the study of <b>manipulating,</b> and the distinction between <b>manipulating</b> information and people, provides a critical approach to the topic of political oratory. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
