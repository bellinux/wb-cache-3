In addition, around Christmas time each year National would produce tempting advertisements festooned with holly leaves. In the late 1950s, National asked the readers of QST what they wanted in a new ham radio receiver, with the result being the National NC-300 (and its successor, the NC-303). It featured a rare 30-35 MHz input for converters for 50, 144 and 220 MHz use (220 MHz equipment was very rare at the time). In 1965, National introduced the solid state HRO 500, which did not incorporate the HRO dial system, but instead relied on a direct readout rather than a conversion scale or chart. At the time, Popular Electronics magazine reviewed the HRO 500 as [...] "possibly the best amateur receiver ever". Today, many National radios are collected, restored and operated by vintage amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E
40|$|Institutions and {{individuals}} aiming at an efficient management for government-financed agricultural R & D in the Netherlands {{are on a}} constantly growing scale confronted with problems pertaining to the formulation, implementation and adjustment of the goals which should be achieved through the organization. Those problems are not specifically inherent in agricultural R & D; they tend to surface in all complex labour-organizations. ("Labour"-organizations are here understood to be those organizations whose members are employees; {{for the sake of}} brevity, this study and its summary condense the term "complex labour-organizations" simply to "organizations"). The investigation under report tries to extend and deepen the insight into a number of aspects which characterise the goal-problems in such organizations. It first of all lists and discusses the related concepts and findings as published in the literature concerned. Next, it presents some feasible applications of this scrutiny with emphasis on agricultural research in the Netherlands. Chapter 1 starts with a primary orientation as regards the goal(s) of an organization. An organization is found not to aim at achieving just one given goal. It faces the task of trying to more or less realize the objectives of various groups of stakeholders: purchasers or users of its goods, products or services; suppliers of funds; suppliers of raw materials, base products and several types of other commodities, machinery, equipment; staff and personnel. The organization is generally confronted with other groups of people who can also be called stakeholders; it should, to a certain extent, also take into account the wishes and demands of individuals, groups and other types of organizations whose interests it might harm through actions, laches or non-feasance. As an organization is thus confronted with a complex range of objectives, wishes and demands - those in society as such, and the ones within its own framework - the desirability of clearly defined descriptions is evident for, on the one hand, values and objectives which are societal and, on the other hand, the individual human needs. Paragraph 1. 2. attempts to analyse and discuss these factors. Dutch society is there shown to have a very wide range of values and objectives indeed, Each individual is, moreover, found to have a large variety of needs; it is noted that those several needs are not of equal intensiveness for all people. Paragraph 1. 3. focuses on the explanations of some concepts which, with reference to goal-problems, are handled frequently. In this context, the interrelation between those concepts are also discussed. In the literature, most of the concepts concerned display their varying meanings. The most important concepts are each nailed down to one single meaning for the subsequent stages of the study under report. Chapter 2 looks into man's different needs and their relationships. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is discussed, and so is the fact that some human needs to a certain extent are contradictory, plus the fact that man's personal grading of needs is not invariable. Next this chapter pays attention to the genesis of man's evaluative judgments, goals and objectives. Numerous factors are found to play a generative part; some are inherent in the individual, others are environmental. Motivating processes in man appear to be far from being fully explained; theories of motivation are found to be diverse. With reference to environmental influences, and their role in the genesis of man's evaluative judgments cum goals and objectives, the contributions of various societal groupings are briefly indicated. The book's second chapter also points out the multifarious changes to which Dutch society, and hence its individual members, is being and has been exposed in the present and most recent decades. Accordingly, much uncertainty and doubt is manifest in families, organizations and many other societal relationships as regards appropriate paths to be followed. The overall picture can thus sooner be characterized through "variety and pluriformity of", "discussion and confusion about" and "search for" than through such terms as "consensus about", when the standards for eligible life-style and societal structure and the ways and means to realize goals and objectives are subjected to investigation. As is demonstrated in chapter 1, there are many different types of persons and groups involved in an organization; each of those tries to serve his, her or their own interest via the organization. Paragraph 3. 1. analyses how those interests may be viewed as regards intercorrespondence or conflict; the conclusion is that they Are partially parallel, and partially conflicting. It is suggested that the dynamics of an organization can be understood only if the organization is not exclusively regarded as a unitary whole but also as a configuration of several interested parties which more or less constantly negotiate with each other and even fight one another. Against this background, paragraph 3. 1. next distinguishes between holistic theories of organization and behavioural concepts and, also, between structuralfunctional theories and action approach. There is no uniformity in thinking, as the literature confirms, with regard to the actual or desirable process of goal-setting in organizations. Some of the most important approaches are discussed in paragraph 3. 2. There are authors who, rather implicitly, pose the harmony of employers, and employees' interests; they consider consultation and collaboration to be vital. Others emphatically reckon with the existence of conflicting interests; to those authors, goal-setting is not solely such a process of consultation and collaboration. To them it is particularly also a process in which negotiation, compromise-finding, plus power and fight all play significant parts. others still regard goal-setting chiefly as a process in which, starting from the organization's primary objective, some subgoals and sub-sub-goals should be derived in a logical and consistent manner. In the opinion of some other writers, the determination of the goals of an organization should doubtless be the ultimate stage in a process of strategic planning. Snellen, in particular, emphasizes this point. The process of strategy formulation, which he suggests, is briefly discussed, in line with its successive stages: determination of existing strategies, analysis of the environment, survey of strengths and weaknesses, development of tentative strategies, choice of definitive strategy. Furthermore, this paragraph presents some indications with reference to the process of strategic planning in enterprises that a number of other authors propose. Paragraph 3. 2. 3. deals with incremental versus rational-comprehensive planning; this distinction is closely related with the difference between satisficing and optimizing planning. Characteristics of the various approaches are discussed. Merits and demerits are indicated for the incremental and the rational-comprehensive methods of planning. Some attention is devoted to a number of approaches which try to combine attractive features of rational and incremental methods and then avoid their respective drawbacks. Discussed are the chief characteristics and most valuable elements of Etzioni's mixed-scanning approach, Dror's optimal model of public policymaking and the biocybernetic, communicative and process planning. Chapter 3 ultimately reviews the problem of stakeholders-participation. Various considerations lead us to the opinion that, in principle, it is desirable that all groups of stakeholders can participate in establishing the goals of an organization. An analysis is made in terms of the organization's need to maintain its proficient and adroit performance, and whether that may be considered as a factor which inhibits employees participation. It is concluded that the need to maintain, or increase, an organization's proficient performance on the one hand inhibits and, on the other, rather stimulates implementation of active participation of employees. Next, the strains between democracy and technocracy are discussed. Various ways and means to ease them are indicated, though relativation of those possibilities is necessary. The conclusion is that concretization of the ideal of expert, {{and at the same time}} democratic, policy-making in organizations remains, for a number of reasons, a difficult task that can only partly be fulfilled. To accomplish goals and objectives, individual persons and groups are noted to adopt divergent ways of approach. Same of them exclusively or <b>mainly</b> <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the model of harmony or "order", others handle the conflict approach. Which model is preferable ? Paragraph 4. 1. deals with that question. First of all it mentions the major aspects of each model, and the differences between the two models. It is pointed out that in the contradistinction between order- and conflict-model an appreciable number of heterogeneous elements, and partly inexact differentiations, are involved: establishment interests versus mankind's welfare; one-track specialists versus critical intellectuals; maintenance of the status-quo versus breakthrough(s); cooperation versus fight. Each of these "opposites" is briefly and critically considered. One of the conclusions is that some individual strategy or other is not all the time the most suitable one to achieve goals or objectives. It certainly depends on the conditions or circumstances of a given situation, which strategy or approach should preferably be chosen. Sometimes that should be collaboration, sometimes fight. Sometimes it should be a middle course in terms of: contrasting views being jointly analysed and discussed in order to generate consensus, negotiations and deliberations aiming at feasible compromise. Paragraph 4. 2. focuses on the vital question of what should be the optimal system of management to achieve the organization's and the employees' goals. Several streams in organization theory have each offered, and still offer, a different reply to that question. Accordingly, the salient points in those theory-streams are established and elucidated; particularly those in the classical theory of management, human-relations approach, revisionism, socio-technical approach, planning theory and systems approach. With reference to this survey, we hold the opinion that the system of management of an organization can only be effective if it at least generates the most favourable conditions to deal adequately with: the needs of, and developments in, the environment; the needs, capacities and potentials of the people within the organization; the nature of the organization's production processes. The problem of an optimal system of management is reviewed against that background. First, the relation between environment and management-system is investigated. It is then found that various types of environment can be discerned and, also, that the contingency theory emphasizes that the characteristics and structure of an organizational entity should depend on the nature of the environment which is relevant for that entity. Accordingly, an organization which must function in a heterogeneous and shifting environment will need a system of management other than that required for an organization whose environment is fairly homogeneous and stable. Next, the relations between the needs of employees and the management-system are discussed. Several aspects of the work-orientation of employees are described. One of the conclusions is that, with regard to this orientation, employees display specific differences and that thus, among employees, partially divergent wishes are observable as regards the system of management. Further attention is paid to the relation between the organization's processes of production and its system of management. An organization must deal with processes different in nature. It is found that for a routine process, a management-system is needed that is rather different from that called upon to efficiently run a process characterized by variation and by the desirability of creative contributions on the part of staff and personnel. Based on these findings, and upon a discussion of results obtained through several investigations, we draw the conclusion that not one specific system of management can be considered as the ideal one, but that it depends on the very conditions and circumstances of a given situation, which system of management would be the most effective. It is furthermore indicated, for arange of situations, which characteristics of the system of management should preferably occur in each of those situations. The final chapter presents considerations and suggestions with regard to the further development of the planning and management of Dutch agricultural research. They are partly based on the findings in previous chapters and partly on the author's personal views and evaluative analyses. Essential elements in the considerations and suggestions are: intensification of strategic planning; promotion of internal and external democratization; expansion of opportunities for processes of consultation, deliberation and negotiation between and among stakeholders; promotion of decentralized decision-making which retains the organization's higher levels'facilities of survey, stimulation and management by exception; intensification of rationality in decision- making; greater flexibility and better problemorientation throughout the organization; improvement in consulting and coordinating work at various levels within the organization. Pertinent recommendations include: periodic drafting of a strategic plan for agricultural R & D; alertness in regard to creation of study groups and committees for policy preparation; evolution of a network of programadvisory committees whose membership should chiefly consist of external stakeholders; evolution of a matrix organization; generation of arrangements promoting expedient, reliable and open supply of information among the respective groups and levels within the organization; evolution of methods and criteria contributing to systemized and objectivated decision-making at the organization's various levels. The closing chapter furthermore sketches some vital elements in a feasible concretization of the process of strategic planning, along with the body of the strategic plan; it also describes the matrix organization and the system for program-advisory committees and (ad hoc) committees for policy-preparation. This part of the investigation concerns proposals which, in recent years, have partly been tested in the practice of Dutch agricultural R & D. Finally it is pointed out that a successful implementation of the suggested improvements calls for joint and permanent action by all concerned...|$|E
40|$|Student {{diversity}} has {{becomes the}} norm in today’s classrooms (Subban, 2006). This trend can also be observed in Indonesian schools (Hamdan & Mattarima, 2012). Learners mirror a large variety in differences; e. g. learner interests, abilities, learning speed, learning styles, developmental level, language level, ability level, attitudes, cultural background, etc. (Moore, 2005; Tomlinson, 2001). The traditional one-size-fits-all instructional strategy – building on single teaching strategy – neglects these student characteristics, and differences in student needs (Fox & Hoffman, 2011). The key solution is to adopt teaching strategies that cater for student diversity (Heacox, 2012; Subban, 2006; Tomlinson, 2014) since all learners deserve good education to achieve optimum learning outcomes (Yun, 2007). Quality of education in Indonesia, {{the context of the}} studies discussed in this PhD, faces clear challenges. One major challenge is related to the low academic achievement of learners as reflected in international reports about student achievement (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Arora, 2012; OECD, 2016 a, 2016 b; Pearson, 2014). Another is related to low teaching quality (Raihani, 2007; Sofo, Fitzgerald, & Jawas, 2012; Sumintono & Raihani, 2010; Sumintono & Subekti, 2014; Zulfikar, 2009). Thirdly, we observe a gap between public and private schools that is reflected in the allocation of funding (Heyneman & Stern, 2014; Stern & Smith, 2016), academic achievement (Newhouse & Beegle, 2006; PUSPENDIK, 2015), salary levels of teachers, teacher motivation (DeRee, Muralidharan, Pradhan, & Rogers, 2015), the number of certified teachers and the level of access to teacher professional development (Künkler & Lerner, 2016). To deal with diverse students as well as to improve the academic achievement, many authors suggest to apply Differentiated Instruction (DI) (Fox & Hoffman, 2011; Subban, 2006; Tomlinson, 2014). DI is instructional approach emphasizing that every student is unique, inherently different, and learns in a different way (Fogarty & Pete, 2011; Tomlinson, 1995), offering students a more responsive and personalized learning experience (Fox & Hoffman, 2011), as well as engaging them in activities that better respond to their particular learning needs, strengths, and preferences (Heacox, 2012). 	DI implementation incorporates the psychological factors of teachers, such as teacher self-efficacy (Dixon, Yssel, McConnell, & Hardin, 2014; Wan, 2015; Wertheim & Leyser, 2002), and teaching beliefs (Cross, 2009; He & Levin, 2008; Valcke, Sang, Rots, & Hermans, 2010). It also involves other related factors such teaching experience (Donnell & Gettinger, 2015; Hargreaves, 2005), professional development (Dixon et al., 2014; Donnell & Gettinger, 2015; Rienties, Brouwer, & Lygo-Baker, 2013), teacher certification, and classroom characteristics (Subban, 2006). Differentiated instruction receives diverse labels such as ‘differentiated assessment’, ‘inclusion’, ‘student-centered’ (Fox & Hoffman, 2011), ‘individualized instruction’ (Hattie, 2009), ‘adaptive instruction’, ‘personalized learning’ (Waxman, Alford, & Brown, 2013), ‘response to intervention’ (Fox & Hoffman, 2011), and ‘Universal Design of Learning’ (UDL) (Hall, Strangman, & Meyer, 2014). Those different labels share the same idea. This is why we put forward the following general DI definition for this PhD: Differentiated instruction is an instructional approach that accommodates the diversity of students by (1) coping with student diversity, (2) adopting specific teaching strategies, (3) invoking a variety in learning activities, (4) monitoring individual student need, and (5) pursuing optimal learning outcomes. Meanwhile, DI is also approaches in different ways, which consequently implies that choices have to be made. This pushes us to define a particular implementation definition of DI. Firstly, we opt for grouping as a key design feature of a specific DI intervention. Secondly, we opt for “math ability” grouping. Next, we choose specific supporting strategies that foster cognitive processing approach (exercising math) and metacognitive processing. Lastly we provide individual and peer support that gives timely feedback in line with student capabilities. These choices help in presenting a more operational definition of DI. This DI approach – {{in the context of this}} PhD - has been studied via an intervention set up in Indonesian primary schools: Differentiated instruction is an instructional approach accommodating the diversity of students by (1) coping with student diversity in math ability levels, (2) adopting specific teaching strategies; ability grouping, (3) invoking a variety of mathematics learning experience by presenting lots of exercising possibilities; (4) monitoring individual student needs; follow-up and feedback by peers/teacher, (5) pursuing optimal learning outcomes; controlling of the time distance between instruction and exercising of the new content with or without metacognitive support. Weaker ability students will get faster instructional opportunities and feedback. Since the literature suggest that psychological factors play an important role in learners and how these factors affect achievement (Aronson, 2002; Neroni, Gijselaers, Kirschner, & Groot, 2015),, we also look in the context of this dissertation at the psychological factors: self-efficacy, motivation, and anxiety related to mathematics as psychological factors in learners. Above we gave a brief summary of research context and conceptual framework of the dissertation that have been extensively explained in the first six chapters of this dissertation. In the next paragraphs we further discuss the research objectives of this dissertation and how the research studies are linked to the research objectives. Research objectives Research objective 1. To explore the nature and the extent of DI implementation in Indonesian school. The first research objective dealt with the actual implementation of DI by teachers in their daily teaching and learning activities. The study examined two aspects: (1) the nature and (2) the extent of DI implementation in Indonesian schools. Furthermore, the study also examined potential differences in the DI implementation between public and private schools. Research objective 2. To examine the relationship between teachers’ DI self-efficacy and teaching beliefs and other related factors to the DI implementation in Indonesian School. The second research objective was to assess DI implementation and how this was related to teachers’ psychological and other factors. In this study, we mainly focused on two psychological teacher factors; i. e. teacher DI self-efficacy, and teaching beliefs. The other factors are linked teacher experience and teaching certification and two school level factors: professional development and classroom size. Research objective 3. To investigate the impact of DI intervention on the student achievement. The third research objective was to examine the impact of a DI intervention on student achievement. The DI intervention adopted in the study built on grouping and metacognitive instruction. The study took into account psychological factors of the students, i. e. math motivation, math efficacy, and math anxiety. Research objective 4. To investigate the effectiveness of DI intervention in helping struggling learners. Our fourth research objective dealt with the effectiveness of DI intervention in helping more in particular struggling learners. The study involved three different ability groups based on their mathematics capabilities, i. e. low ability, medium ability, and high ability. We considered the low ability group as the struggling learners. Overview of the chapters presented in this dissertation Chapter 2 : Differentiated instruction in primary schools: Implementation and challenges in Indonesia. The study was based on a teacher survey, administered to a sample of 604 Indonesian primary schools in the most populated province, Jakarta. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out to assess the nature and the extent of DI implementation. We focused on five DI-dimensions, following our general DI definition. The results show that the nature of actual DI implementation in these Indonesian primary schools is varied. Considering the first dimension, coping with student diversity, most teachers feel realistic, as they want their students to succeed. They adopt appropriate teaching strategies. In view of the second dimension, adopting specific teaching strategies, the teachers <b>mainly</b> <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> grouping students in their teaching and learning activities. Furthermore, they do not agree with the one-size-fits-all (OSFA) strategy. They explicitly state this OSFA cannot accommodate student diversity. Related to the third dimension, invoking a variety in learning activities, the teachers help students being active in the class in view of comprehension of what is to be learned. Most teachers agree on the need to select different learning activities for different students. In relation to the fourth DI dimension, monitoring individual student needs, the majority of teachers agree to monitor individual students as a key responsibility of a teacher. They try to understand the nature of specific student characteristics and needs. The fifth DI dimension, pursuing optimal learning outcomes, pushes teachers to opt for active learning, to motivate students and to give extra time for remedial and enrichment activities, following the needs of a student. Studying the extent of DI implementation, we observed a DI implementation index score of 7. 31 / 10. The score seems high. But it is lower compared to the benchmark of mastery learning (Zimmerman & Dibenedetto, 2008) of 80 %. This finding reflects the need for Indonesian teachers to improve their DI implementation. None of the five DI decision dimensions (see definition) reflects scores that are at par with the benchmark. The fact that the DI implementation in Indonesia is below par, stresses the need to invest heavily in teacher professional development and to pay attention to a reorientation in Indonesian teacher education. Chapter 3 : The implementation of differentiated instruction in Indonesia: A comparison between public and private schools This study was based on data from 294 public primary school teachers, and 310 private school teachers. The analysis results revealed – as expected - a significant gap between both types of school. The public school teachers reported a significantly higher extent of DI implementation than their counterparts in private schools. The significant difference is observed in some major decision dimensions in DI: dimension 1, coping with student diversity; dimension 4, monitoring individual students need; and dimension 5, pursuing optimal learning outcome. These particular findings reiterate the gaps – already reported in the literature – in the quality of public and private school as reflected e. g., in operational funds (Heyneman & Stern, 2014), and student performance (Newhouse & Beegle, 2006; PUSPENDIK, 2015), salary levels of teachers and teacher motivation (DeRee et al., 2015), the number of certified teachers and the level of access to teacher professional development (Künkler & Lerner, 2016). Our findings corroborate the need to equally support both types of schools, as all students deserve optimal quality in teaching and learning (Yun, 2007). Moreover, the privileges of public schools result in an imbalance in the quality of education in Indonesia (Heyneman & Stern, 2014). Chapter 4 : Teacher and their implementation of differentiated instruction in the classroom The results of this study show a significant and positive relationship between all variables (DI self-efficacy, teaching beliefs, teaching experience, teacher certification, professional development, classroom size) and the level of DI implementation. DI self-efficacy seems to contribute significantly and strongly to the level of DI implementation, but the association of constructivist teaching beliefs remains low. Moreover, the traditional management teaching beliefs seem not significantly associated. Our findings mainly support the importance of teachers’ self-efficacy as a predictor of changes in DI practices in primary school teachers (De Neve, Devos, & Tuytens, 2015), and teachers’ intention to frequently adopt DI practices (Wertheim & Leyser, 2002). On the other hand, our assumptions as to the linkage between teaching beliefs and DI adoption are hardly confirmed. It might be because in this study, we did not let our teachers focus on a specific content domain when studying their teaching beliefs. The literature in relation to beliefs often stresses that beliefs should be contextualized (Pajares, 1992). Next, we also observed no significant contribution of teaching experience, teacher certification, and teacher professional development to teacher’s level of DI implementation. But, the contextual factor “classroom size” was significantly linked. This finding implies that the bigger the classroom, the higher the need to implement DI to accommodate student diversity (Subban, 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2003). The results in relation to teacher experience are not surprising. Donnell and Gettinger (2015) also found no significant relationship between teaching experience and adoption of innovative teaching practices. Our sampling framework could have been the cause, by including a disproportional large number of teachers with a particular experience level. Also, the relationship between experience and adoption of innovations is not always linear: more experience – higher adoption (Hargreaves, 2005). The insignificant relation between PD and DI implementation is striking. This might be related to the nature of the PD content, the teachers reported no explicit focus on DI. Another reason might be related to the lack of PD that is relevant for the real classroom context as also raised by Luschei and Zubaidah (2012). Also, we can link this to the still predominant central policy influences in Indonesian education. Teachers still rely heavily on the directives of central authorities and - though teacher and school autonomy is increasing - hardly make use of local autonomy to implement local practices and policies (Bjork, 2005). Chapter 5 : The impact of differentiated instruction on student achievement: Grouping and metacognitive support as key design variables This chapter is based on the quasi-experimental study involving 223 students, assigned to 3 research conditions: 59 students in a grouping, 53 students in a grouping + MCI, and 111 students in a control condition. The study analyzed the differential impact of the DI-intervention approaches on math learning performance. Analysis of research result revealed that DI-grouping had a significant differential and positive impact on math performance. Learners in this condition outperformed learners in the two other conditions. Surprisingly, learners in the grouping + MCI condition performed significantly worse than those in the grouping condition and not significantly different from learners in the control group. The impact of DI-grouping corroborates the findings reported in the literature; especially when looking at implementations in the mathematics domain (Lou, 2013; McQuarrie & McRae, 2010). These results confirm our theoretical expectations about the impact of the ZPD in comparable ability group settings. Teachers seem to be better able to accommodate the level of learners when tackling exercises when student diversity is manageable and the distance between the current level and the next development level is somewhat smaller in a group of learners being supported at the same time. Next, the fact the DI grouping + MCI intervention did not produce the expected outcomes, is surprising. Reasons to explain this are found in the fact that MCI needs time to have an impact (see Gourgey, 1998), it requires extra cognitive resources that already is being used to tackle new math learning content, and it requires extra time and effort (Schwartz et al., 2009). Math efficacy had a significant impact on math achievement. However, math anxiety, and math motivation had no significant impact. We refer in this context to the integration of the intervention in the regular classroom activities. The intervention was set up during two of the four math lessons in the same week. This implies that students still experienced the “traditional” math instructional approach during the non-DI lessons. This might have caused inconsistencies in learner experiences and introduced uncontrolled bias in the study. In addition, the DI intervention was only integrated in the math lessons and not in language learning lessons, science classes, physical education, etc. Research shows that conditions for successful innovations or change often depend on the scale of the innovation and the extent to which the innovation is sufficiently comprehensive and school-wide. Chapter 6 : Helping struggling learners: Evaluating the implementation of differentiated instruction. The study involved 69 low ability learners, 81 medium ability learners, and 73 high ability learners. The findings of this last study showed that the DI intervention seems beneficial for all students. When looking at the significant differential positive impact of grouping, all learners of different ability levels appeared to have gained academically. This reiterates the findings of Hanushek, Kain, Markman, and Rivkin (2003), who also found that group interactions and peer influences are beneficial for the full range of learner abilities. It appears that supporting learners in their Zone of Proximate Development works for all ability levels. Nevertheless, our results also showed that high ability learners keep outperforming the other ability groups. But, especially when taking initial math performance into account, the impact of the DI intervention is not always linear. It was remarkable to see that middle ability level learners reflected higher scores as compared to low and high ability learners in the grouping + MCI condition. Though this DI intervention did not result in significantly higher math performance, compared to learners in the control condition, it was nevertheless worth noting how middle ability level learners reacted differently to the MCI approach. This urges us at least to be careful in our expectations as to the “linear” impact of interventions. Montague, Krawec, Enders, and Dietz (2014) referred to this when studying the impact of cognitive strategy instruction in middle school. Implications of the findings in this dissertation Theoretical implications The results empirically link teacher DI self-efficacy and teaching beliefs to levels of DI implementation. This also strengthens theoretical models of teacher professionalism and the Onion model of Korthagen that interlinks behavior, competences and underlying factors. The findings in our DI intervention study imply that we can underpin theoretical assumptions about ability grouping and how DI reinforces the mechanisms as defined in Vygotsky’s theory about the Zone of Proximate Development (Vygotsky, 1980). Grouping and ability grouping seem to empirically ground these assumptions. Practical implications As to practical implications, the findings of the first studies (chapter 2) push the school to consider psychological factors in teachers, i. e. Self-efficacy and teaching beliefs, when developing programs for teacher education and teacher professional development (PD). Teachers should be confronted with their own teaching beliefs, their own behavior, and their own competences. This requires more in-depth, longer duration and active PD approaches. Policy implications From a policy perspective, an innovation plan should be set up that interlinks teacher professional development, teacher initial training, school support, school policy development and school monitoring. At the same time, school principals could be made accountable to map and track the teaching approaches of their teachers to cater for student diversity. School based monitoring, considering the particular school diversity, should be established and schools/principals should be empowered with tools and expertise to monitor learner and teacher progress. A collaboration with universities and teacher education institutes could be beneficial in this context to pool expertise. The fact that DI implementation in Indonesia is still below par, leads to a strong recommendation to the Indonesian educational authorities to look in-depth at teacher professional development (PD) programs in Indonesia both for pre-service teachers and for in-service teachers. Towards a comprehensive approach to implement DI in Indonesia, some grounding ideas The findings of the studies in the present PhD, our discussion of the results, an analysis of limitations and a first projection of implications are helpful to draft the outline of a more comprehensive approach to implement differentiated instruction in Indonesia. Firstly, we propose strengthening initial teacher education. The teacher education has a significant role in improving quality of teaching, and therefore the initial teacher education in teacher education institution needs to be improved. Secondly, we propose an enhancement of the quantity and quality of professional development (PD). The result of the fourth chapter in this PhD thesis revealed that 27 % of the participating teachers never attended PD. This is strange and crucial, as teacher is the key player in an education setting that should receive opportunities for continuous upgrading their professional competences. The research has s...|$|E

During the period from June to September 2003 a survey involving 2, 995 high school boys and girls, 14 to 19 years of age, was conducted using standardized questionnaire. The age, sex, place of residence (municipality), sexarcha age (first intercourse age), usage and knowledge about contraception methods were recorded. Our results have shown that 395 (13, 18 %) high school youth were sexually active. The age average of sexarcha for girls was 16, 50 and for boys 15, 7 years of age. In undeveloped municipalities sexual activity of adolescents of both genders was significantly higher then in the developed ones (p< 0, 05). High school boys aged 14 to 19 years were sexually more active and had an intercourse more frequently than girls {{of the same age}} (p< 0, 0001). Sexually active high school youth <b>mainly</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> condoms (boys 63 %, girls 59, 8 %). Most sexually active adolescents who did not use any protection originated from undeveloped municipalities. A statistically significant difference between the girls and boys related to usage of contraception did not exist. Most high school youth showed insufficient knowledge about contraceptive methods (74, 50 % boys and 57, 50 % girls). Statistically girls showed significantly better knowledge about contraception than boys (p< 0, 0001). Results of this study have shown that sexual activity of high school youth in Tuzla Canton was not a massive appearance and knowledge and usage of contraceptive methods was very weak, so adequate actions should be taken especially in undeveloped municipalities where this problem is more significant...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} {{character of}} spoken language obliges interpreting researchers {{to proceed to}} a transcription of recorded data for purposes of analysis. While transcription is essential to interpreting research, its complexity has received little attention so far in Interpreting Studies. In a field such as community interpreting for example, where social interaction is a determining factor, researchers <b>mainly</b> and usually <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> representational choices which do not really allow them to highlight the interactional patterns and the subjacent power constellation inherent to the event. Such patterns and power constellations are also visible in courtroom interaction (Adelswärd et alii, 1987). Starting from a reflexive transcription practice (Buchholz, 2000), this contribution explores the advantages of a horizontal transcription format by pre-allocating columns to the speakers, and argues that horizontality in transcripts of community-based interpreted interactions allows for a better visualization of elements which are central to linguistic and pragmatic analysis. These findings are demonstrated through {{the analysis of the}} turns-at-talk sequences in a horizontal transcript of a courtroom examination.

40|$|A presente investigação visa abordar as dificuldades sentidas pelos {{professor}}es da disciplina de Educação Visual do 3 ºCiclo do Ensino Básico no processo motivacional de ensino-aprendizagem em alunos adolescentes de oitavo ano. Na qualidade de professor de Educação Visual há já vários anos, pude verificar, invariavelmente, ano após ano, que os alunos do oitavo ano são, não só os mais difíceis de motivar, como também os mais incumpridores de prazos, independentemente do tema de trabalho que lhes seja apresentado. No ensino da educação visual, sobretudo no 3 º Ciclo, o professor deve fomentar situações de aprendizagem pela descoberta trazendo ao aluno a vontade de descobrir e experienciar ainda mais, através da exploração de materiais, técnicas e tecnologias e construindo assim o percurso do seu saber. Nesta perspetiva, e considerando {{a natural}} e constante vontade dos alunos por experimentar coisas novas e descobrir novos resultados, o professor tem na curiosidade dos alunos e na criação de desafios, uma base motivacional para usar como sua aliada na obtenção do sucesso dos alunos. Assim, é objetivo deste estudo, através da realização de um Livro de Artista (sob o formato Livro Carrossel) que ilustrasse os momentos mais marcantes da vida dos alunos, verificar as suas escolhas técnicas e pessoais, bem como de que forma este se constitui e revela um estímulo motivacional, quer na organização do processo de ensino, quer na condução e avaliação das aprendizagens destes alunos. Os principais resultados obtidos neste estudo não apontam o tema ou as técnicas aplicadas como os principais meios para estimular e motivar os alunos a realizar os trabalhos da disciplina. Rapazes e raparigas destacam vivências idênticas como as mais marcantes das suas vidas, utilizando qualquer técnica ao seu alcance sem critério particular de escolha para as representar. De qualquer forma e em geral, os alunos revelaram uma tendência para a utilização de técnicas pouco laboriosas, sendo que optaram maioritariamente pela aplicação de uma só técnica na execução do trabalho. The present work aims {{to address the}} challenges faced by Visual Education class teachers of the 3 º Cycle of Basic School in the motivational process of teaching-learning in eighth grade teenage students. In the quality of Visual Education teacher for several years now, I was able to notice that, invariably, eighth grade students are not only {{the most difficult to}} motivate but also the most deadline defaulters, regardless of the work theme presented to them. While teaching visual education, especially on the 3 rd Cycle, the teacher should promote learning situations through discovery providing the student with the will to discover and experience even more, exploring materials, techniques and technologies hence laying out their learning path. Under this framework, and considering the natural and constant will of students to try new things and discover new results, the teacher has in the curiosity of students and in the creation of challenges, a motivational basis to use has an ally for achieving student success. In this way, it is the objective of this study, through the creation of an Artist’s Book (in the format of a Carousel Book) that would illustrate the most striking moments {{in the life of the}} students, to check the students’ technical and personal choices, as well as in which way it constitutes and reveals itself a motivational stimulus, both in the organization of the teaching process and in the conduction and evaluation of these students’ learnings. The main findings of this study do not indicate the theme or applied techniques as the principal means with which to stimulate and motivate the students to perform the class projects. Boys and girls highlight identical experiences as those most striking of their lives, using any technique available without specific criteria of choice to represent them. Generally, the students revealed a tendency to utilize less labour-intensive techniques, <b>mainly</b> <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> the application of only one technique throughout the work.

Here, a follow-up is described for 63 healthy women at 50 % risk of being a BRCA 1 /BRCA 2 mutation carrier who underwent genetic testing. The course of distress and problems regarding body image and sexuality up to 1 year after disclosure of the test-outcome were described separately for mutation carriers undergoing mastectomy (n = 14), <b>for</b> mutation carriers <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> surveillance (n = 12) and for non-mutation carriers (n = 37). Furthermore, we analyzed whether women <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> prophylactic mastectomy differed from those <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> close surveillance with respect to biographical characteristics, experiences with cancer in relatives and personality. Women <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> prophylactic mastectomy had significantly higher distress levels than mutation carriers who <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> surveillance, and the non-mutation carriers. This difference in levels of distress was highest at pre- and post-test and had almost disappeared at 1 -year follow-up. Besides, mutation carriers <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> prophylactic mastectomy were more often in their thirties, more often had young children and had a longer awareness of the genetic nature of cancer in the family than those <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> regular surveillance.
