50|$|The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> (S. t. mongolica) {{is found}} in a small area in western Mongolia around the Sharga and Mankhan Nature Reserves.|$|E
50|$|S. t. mongolica Bannikov, 1946: Also {{known as}} the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga.</b> It is {{sometimes}} treated as an independent species, or as subspecies of S. borealis. Confined to Mongolia.|$|E
5000|$|Sharga (Шарга) is a sum (district) of Govi-Altai Province {{in western}} Mongolia. The area {{has one of}} the last two populations of the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> antelope, which is {{protected}} in Sharga Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|Sharga Nature Reserve (Шарга) is {{a reserve}} {{in the western}} part of Mongolia. It {{comprises}} 2.860 km2 and is located in Govi-Altai Province in the area of the Sharga sum. The reserve has been created in 1993 together with Mankhan Nature Reserve to protect the endangered <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga.</b>|$|E
50|$|Only males possess horns. These horns, {{thick and}} {{slightly}} translucent, are wax-coloured and show 12 to 20 pronounced rings. With a base diameter of 25 - 33 mm, {{the horns of}} the Russian saiga measure 28 - 38 cm in length; the horns of the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga,</b> however, reach a maximum length of 22 cm.|$|E
50|$|Mankhan Nature Reserve is {{a reserve}} {{in the western}} part of Mongolia. It is located south of Khar Us Nuur National Park in Khovd Province on the main road between Hovd City and Ulaanbaatar. Most of the area lies in the Mankhan sum. The reserve {{stretches}} over 3,000 km2 and has been created in 1993 together with Sharga Nature Reserve to protect the endangered <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga.</b> In addition to these antelopes, there are also goitered gazelles.|$|E
50|$|The coat shows {{seasonal}} changes. In summer, {{the coat}} appears yellow to red, fading toward the flanks. The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> {{can develop a}} sandy colour. The coat develops a pale grayish brown colour in winter, {{with a hint of}} brown on the belly and the neck. The ventral parts are generally white. The hairs, that measure 18 - 30 mm long in summer, can grow as long as 40 - 70 mm in winter. This forms a 12 - 15 cm long mane on the neck. Two distinct moults can be observed in a year-one in spring (April to May) and another in autumn (late September or early October to late November or early December). The tail measures 6 - 12 cm.|$|E
50|$|The saiga antelope, once {{a common}} species, {{has been reduced}} by {{pressures}} including hunting, livestock grazing, and high Chinese medicinal value, with the Mongolian subspecies reaching a critically endangered level, with fewer than 5,000 individuals left in the wild. The wild horse, in particular, had almost become extinct (not seen {{for more than three}} decades) and was therefore reintroduced from captive sources. Other species of mammals reported include: argali (Ovis ammon) (in the rocky mountains of the Gobi desert), common wolf, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> (Saiga tatarica mongolica), musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), Pallas's cat (Felis manul) or manul, black tailed gazelle (Gazelle subgutturosa), stone martin (Martes foina), and wild cats in the Altai ecoregion; wild boar (Sus scrofa nigipes), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer in the forest areas and muskrat, red fox, steppe fox, and sable in the forest and steppe margin areas.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{selection}} for calving by ungulates {{is an important}} behavioral trait because it affects neonate survival. Generally, ungulate calving site selection varies by vulnerability to predators, local topography, habitat quality and level of human disturbance. The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> (Saiga tatarica mongolica) is endemic to Mongolia where a threatened population of ∼ 7000 exists in the northern Gobi Desert. We analyzed factors that could affect selection of saiga calving locations in the Sharga Nature Reserve, western Mongolia, using data obtained from ground surveys over 4 years between 2008 and 2012. Multiple factors explain calving location selection by saiga antelopes, {{based on the results}} of a generalized linear mixed model within a use availability framework. Individual saiga females preferred calving locations that were away from settlements and closer to water sources and avoided steeper slopes in comparison with random locations. These results demonstrate that the choice of calving locations for saiga antelope is driven by both internal and external factors. Understanding which factors influence calving location {{selection for}} saiga provides insights to protect important habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} mammals {{suffering}} intense poaching {{in remote areas}} poses an increasingly difficult conservation challenge, {{in part because the}} extreme flightiness of such species complicates safe capture. The benefits of handling (an opportunity to obtain biological information and attach radio collars) must be weighed against stress to the animals and potential capture-related mortality. In parts of Central Asia this problem is not trivial, as populations have been heavily harvested and opportunities for restraint are often limited. <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> Saiga tatarica mongolica, being both Endangered and poached, typifies these issues. Here we describe capture protocols for adult females handled quickly and without anaesthesia. Using multiple vehicles driven at high speed, individual saiga were isolated from groups and herded into nets. Chase time was linearly associated with rectal temperature (P, 0. 03), with maximum pursuits and temperatures of 9 minutes and 43. 1 degrees C, respectively; time to release averaged 3 ̆c 7 minutes. Given that rural residents often chase saiga and other desert and steppe-dwelling ungulates, for photography or for amusement, our results offer conservationists and government officials an empirical basis for recommending prudence on chase times and/or for recommending that the practice be prevented...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{that affect}} group sizes in large {{ungulates}} are generally poorly understood for species from remote regions. Understanding grouping patterns {{is important for}} effective species management, but is lacking for the endangered <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> (Saiga tatarica mongolica). We studied seasonal changes in the group size and social structure of saigas in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors in western Mongolia during 2009 – 2012. To identify group size and composition, we observed saigas monthly while conducting monitoring surveys, and weekly while tracking radio-collared animals. We observed 9268 individuals; median group size was 6. 5 (SE = 1. 7; range = 1 – 121), and groups of 1 – 5 animals were most common. Seasonality exerted strong effects with the smallest groups in June and largest in December. The largest mixed and nursery groups formed during pre-rutting and summer seasons, respectively, but no seasonal differences were detected for bachelor groups. The best fitting model, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, predation rate and season as covariates, explained ~ 76 % {{of the variation in}} monthly ‘typical’ group size. Our results are concordant with studies of other arid-adapted ungulates and suggest vegetation productivity, predation rate and biological cycles are responsible for saiga grouping patterns in Mongolia...|$|E
40|$|The Mongolian Gobi {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{spectacular}} and important regions in Central Asia, comprising the largest area of intact grassland in the world. In recent years, a growing human population, expanding exploitation of natural resources, and the development of infrastructure in the region place increasing pressure on these species and their habitats. This dissertation has focused on three species of ungulates such as <b>Mongolian</b> <b>saiga</b> (Saiga tatarica mongolica) in western Mongolia, and Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus), and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) in Southern Gobi. The study on endangered saiga antelope in western Mongolia found that the calving location selection of saiga influenced by multiple factors and individual saiga females preferred calving locations that were away from settlements and closer to water sources and avoided steeper slopes. While the variation in saiga group size predominantly determined by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, predation rate and season. These results demonstrate that the choice of calving locations and grouping patterns of saiga antelope is driven by both internal and external factors. Understanding which factors influence calving location selection and variation in group size for saiga provides insights to the management of this endangered antelope. The ground-based ungulate survey in the Southern Gobi of Mongolia confirm that Mongolia’s Gobi desert still supports the largest population of khulan and goitered gazelle in the world. Spatial analyses results of the ground survey suggest disturbance associated with human activities have a negative influence on the amount and distribution of suitable habitats for khulan and goitered gazelles in Southern Gobi. Spatially explicit models also indicate approximately half the study area is unsuitable habitat for khulan and goitered gazelles. The data presented here contain valuable information on factors influencing distribution and calving site selection of the plains ungulates and these results can be used to plan mitigation measures and reduce the impacts of developments. The ways in which we approach this important question can also serve as a model for other systems...|$|E
