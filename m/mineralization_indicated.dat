The debris was weighed {{at the beginning and}} end of the experiment and determined their cell wall fractions; RESULTS: The coefficients of <b>mineralization</b> <b>indicated</b> higher velocity decay of organic matter refractory in T. ovata. There was no difference in taxonomic structure of macroinvertebrates, between the two substrates, but the community exhibited distinct functional feeding groups in the peak of colonization, with a greater number of shredders in T. ovata. The successive states of decomposition of the two plant detritus showed distinct macroinvertebrate densities; CONCLUSIONS: The amount and state of the plant biomass were important factors influencing the density and diversity of the macroinvertebrate fauna throughout the process of organic decomposition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Analyses {{of fluid}} {{inclusion}} gases from Mississippi Valley-type districts in east Tennessee reveal {{the presence of}} several distinct aqueous solutions and vapors {{that were part of}} the mineralizing process. Inclusion contents were released by crushing 5 to 25 mg mineral samples and by decrepitating individual inclusions; all analyses were obtained by quadrupole mass spectrometry. Most analyzed inclusion fluids consist of Hz 0 with significant amounts of CH 4 (0. 3 to 2. 9 mol%), COz (0. 1 to 4. 7 mol%), and smaller amounts of C 2 H 6, C,Hs, H & SO*, N 2, and Ar. In general, inclusion gas abundances are greatest for sphalerite from the Mascot-Jefferson City district, lower for the Sweetwater district, and lowest for the Copper Ridge district. Compositional similarities in the inclusion fluids from the three districts imply that mineralization probably formed from fluids that permeated the entire region, rather than from completely separate fluids at each site. Saturation pressures calculated for these fluid compositions range from 300 to 2200 bars. Burial depths for the host unit have been estimated to be about 2 to 3 km in the east Tennessee area during Devonian time, the age of <b>mineralization</b> <b>indicated</b> by recent isotopic ages.

The photocatalytic activity of the Ag-TiO 2 was evaluated in the 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) degradation and mineralization in aqueous solution under UV-A illumination. The experiments demonstrated that TCP was effectively degraded by more than 95 % within 120 min. It was confirmed that the presence of Ag on TiO 2 catalysts could enhance the photocatalytic oxidation of TCP in aqueous suspension and the experimental results showed that the kinetics of TCP degradation follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. It was found that an optimal dosage of 0. 5 wt % Ag in TiO 2 achieved the fastest TCP degradation under the experimental conditions. The experimental results of TCP <b>mineralization</b> <b>indicated</b> while total organic carbon was reduced by a high portion of up to 80 % within 120 min, most chlorine on TCP was more quickly converted to chloride within the first 40 min.

In China, it is also extensively used for growing grain crops, especially in temperature and rainfall limited areas. However, it remains unclear whether the technology is sustainable in terms of maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) balance. We assessed the effects of plastic-film mulch on the SOC balance in maize (Zea mays L.) production {{in a range of}} cold semiarid environments. We imposed four treatments: (i) no plastic-film mulch or straw incorporation, (ii) plastic-film mulch, (iii) straw incorporation in soil without mulch, and (v) straw incorporation plus mulch, in ridge–furrow prepared fields at five sites along a hydrothermal gradient for up to six years. Maize root biomass across sites increased by 23 – 38 % in mulched plots associated with the increase in aboveground biomass, indicating an increased SOC input, compared to that in non-mulched plots. The plastic-film mulch increased SOC <b>mineralization,</b> <b>indicated</b> by the stimulated decomposition of buried maize straw, and a 4 – 5 % reduction in the concentration of light-fraction SOC (< 1. 8 gcm− 3), but the total SOC concentration and stock in the 0 – 0. 15 m soil layer did not change relative to no mulch after six years of continuous cropping. Plastic-film mulch did not affect the total non-cellulosic sugar content; however, it significantly increased the contribution of microbial-synthesized sugars to the total non-cellulosic sugars, indicating an intensified microbial action on the SOC pool compared to no mulch. Straw incorporation increased the root biomass, light and total SOC concentrations and non-cellulosic sugars, and changed the non-cellulosic sugar composition. We conclude that the increase in soil temperature and moisture by use of plastic-film mulch enhances productivity, but importantly maintains the SOC level in temperature- and rainfall-limited semiarid regions by balancing the increased SOC mineralization with increased root-derived C input...|$|E

Pressures at these depths, whether hydrostatic or lithostatic, would not have been adequate to prevent phase separation. Thus, our gas analyses represent either a mixture of vapor-rich and liquid-rich inclusions, or liquid-rich inclusions that trapped excess vapor. A lack of visible vapor-rich inclusions, high gas contents in individual fluid inclusion gas analyses obtained by decrepitation, and a positive correlation between decrepitation temperature and gas content for individual inclusions strongly suggest that the samples contain liquid-rich inclusions that trapped varying amounts of excess vapor. This excess gas probably accounts for the anomalously high homogenization temperatures and the wide range of homogenization temperatures observed in fluid inclusions in these ores. The vapor phase could have formed either by phase separation resulting from over-pressured aqueous fluids migrating into a region of hydrostatic pressure, or by incorporation of a pre-existing gas cap at the sites of deposition into the invading aqueous fluid. Exsolution of a vapor phase from the mineralizing brines should cause precipitation of carbonate and sulfide minerals, but reaction path modelling indicates that the resulting sparry dolomite:sphalerite ratios would be too high to form an ore-grade deposit. On the other hand, if the vapor phase was from a pre-existing sour gas cap that was intercepted by a Zn-rich brine, large amounts of sphalerite would precipitate in a fairly small region.

Finally, the comparison of the Sr isotope ratios of Moroccan barites and hydrothermal Hercynian barites from Sardinia and Bavaria shows overlapping values, suggesting that the radiogenic Sr involved in the crystallisation of these minerals was mainly derived from pre-Hercynian schists.

40|$|SUMMARY: Little {{is known}} of the {{southern}} continuation of the Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) rocks of the Derbyshire Dome where they lie concealed beneath Triassic rocks at {{the margin of the}} Needwood Basin. Evidence from regional Bouguer gravity anomaly surveys pointed to the existence of a ridge of shallow Dinantian rocks, here called the Snelston Ridge, largely concealed by Triassic strata apart from two small inliers. The NNW-SSE trending ridge was proved by a borehole which inter-sected (Dinantian) Widmerpool Formation rocks at a depth of 61 m. Evidence from a seismic reflection profile indicates that the ridge, at least at Birchwoodpark (Snelston), is probably an asymmetrical, fault-controlled anticline. There is, however, no evidence for any significant changes in the thickness of Dinantian rocks hereabouts. The base metal potential of the Snelston Ridge was investigated using detailed geophysical and geochemical surveys and drilling. A borehole {{on the top of the}} mineralized mudmound that forms the Limestone Hill Inlier proved minor replacement galena-sphalerite-baryte mineralization with up to 10 % Pb over an intersection of about 11 m.

This study focuses on five bodies, the Mahoganies, two near Wild Horse Reservoir, the outcrop enclosing the Jarbidge Mountains, and one outcrop south of Wells. The study’s focus is providing field, petrography, geochemistry, oxygen isotope, and geochronology information about the five previously mentioned bodies. Physical volcanology encountered during this study indicates the sampled Jarbidge Rhyolite are effusive lava flows and domes that coalesced {{over the life of}} the volcanic system. First order approximations indicate that erupted products cover ~ 1, 289 km 2 and erupted material totals ~ 509 km 3. Petrography indicates primary anhydrous mineral assemblages, assimilation of granitoid, possible assimilation of metamorphic rock and magma mixing of mafic and silicic bodies. Collectively, the Jarbidge Rhyolite lava flows sampled are compositionally restricted from rhyolite to high silica rhyolite and all samples demonstrate A-type magma characteristics. Compositions from different bodies overlap on Harker diagrams, and trace element ratios distinguish few flows from the other samples. Rare earth element patterns mimic one another, and incompatible trace element ratios overlap between bodies, likely indicating the presence of one large magma body.

Here we investigated {{the role of a}} known Wnt target, ENC 1 (ectodermal-neural cortex 1; NRP/B), in osteoblast differentiation. Enc 1 expression was detected in mouse osteoblasts, chondrocytes and osteocytes by in situ hybridization, and osteoblastic expression was verified in differentiating primary cultures and MC 3 T 3 -E 1 pre-osteoblast cells, with 57 kDa and 67 kDa ENC 1 protein isoforms detected throughout differentiation. Induced knockdown of both ENC 1 isoforms reduced alkaline phosphatase staining and virtually abolished MC 3 T 3 -E 1 mineralization. At culture confluence, Alpl (alkaline phosphatase liver/bone/kidney) expression was markedly reduced compared with control cells, and there was significant and coordinated alteration of other genes involved in cellular phosphate biochemistry. In contrast, with 67 kDa-selective knockdown mineralized nodule formation was enhanced and there was a 2 -fold increase in Alpl expression at confluence. There was enhanced expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes with knockdown of both isoforms at this time-point and a 5 -fold increase in Frzb (Frizzled related protein) with 67 kDa-selective knockdown at <b>mineralization,</b> <b>indicating</b> possible ENC 1 interactions with Wnt signaling in osteoblasts. These results are the first to demonstrate a role for ENC 1 in the control of osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, the contrasting mineralization phenotypes and transcriptional patterns seen with coordinate knockdown of both ENC 1 isoforms vs selective knockdown of 67 kDa ENC 1 suggest opposing roles for the isoforms in regulation of osteoblastic differentiation, through effects on Alpl expression and phosphate cellular biochemistry. This study is the first to report differential roles for the ENC 1 isoforms in any cell lineage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{indirect}} {{electrochemical oxidation}} of phenol {{has been studied}} in at Ti/IrO 2 and Ti/Pt-SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 5, electrodes by bulk electrolysis experiments under galvanostatic control. The obtained results have clearly shown that the electrode material is an important parameter for the optimization of such processes, deciding of their mechanism and of the oxidation products. Different current efficiencies were obtained at Ti/IrO 2 and Ti/Pt-SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 5, depending on the applied current density {{in the range from}} 10, 20 and 30 mA cm − 2. Also the effect of the amount of NaCl dissolved was studied. It has been observed that the electrochemical processes (direct/indirect) favor specific oxidation pathways depending on electrocatalytic material.

40|$|Carbon (C), {{nitrogen}} (N), {{and calcium}} (Ca) cycling in forest ecosystems is controlled {{largely by the}} recycling of organic matter by biota and by the balance of new inputs and losses. In the northeastern U. S., the availability of these elements has been dramatically altered by human activities. Acid deposition has increased N inputs and caused declines in soil Ca concentrations. Concurrently, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising. My dissertation research focused on understanding how individual tree species influence ecosystem C, N, and Ca cycling, and how increasing soil Ca by liming affects C and N pools, fluxes, and dissolved organic matter retention. In chapter 1, I show how Norway spruce, red oak, and sugar maple planted in a common garden influence soil C, N, and Ca pools. Norway spruce had the largest C and N stocks in the forest floor and upper mineral soils. No differences among species were observed in soil exchangeable Ca availability. Red oak plots displayed the highest foliar litter lignin concentrations, the shortest residence time for C and N in the forest floor, and the highest earthworm densities. This suggests that leaf litter recalcitrance is not the dominant driver of decomposition in this forest and that other factors, such {{as the presence of}} earthworms, can influence organic matter turnover in ways that are unexpected when only considering litter chemistry. In chapters 2 and 3, I discuss the long-term effects of liming on ecosystem C and N dynamics. Twenty years after lime addition, {{there was no evidence of}} a tree response. Within the forest floor, C and N stocks in limed soils were double that found in controls. I observed reductions in both soil basal respiration and net N <b>mineralization,</b> <b>indicating</b> that liming has altered C and N cycling within this ecosystem. I also investigated how soil exchangeable Ca concentrations influence dissolved organic C and N retention. Soils higher in exchangeable Ca tended to release less C and N, suggesting that liming may facilitate Ca-organic matter bridging, thereby reducing C and N losses from the upper mineral soils...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{classical}} concept expressed by Follis (1), the initial change {{in the process of}} repair of the rachitic lesion of bone consists in "the deposition of lime salts in the cartilage adjacent to the rachitic metaphysis. " A time lapse of 24 to 48 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the deposition of minerals has been reported by investigators who utilized histological methods for the recognition of salts (2, 3). Cohn and Greenberg (4) and also Morgareidge and Manly (5) have reported an increase in P ~ uptake of rachitic bone, 54 to 72 hours after administration of vitamin D. Recent experiments by Dziewiatkowski (6) have revealed a time interval of 36 to 48 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the deposition of P ~ in the femurs and tibiae of young rats. On the other hand, Ramalingaswami et al. (7) have recently studied the organic matrix of rat cartilage, noting changes in the glycogen metabolism, alkaline phosphatase, and some "nucleo-protein-like " material. Dziewiatkowski (6) and Carlsson (8) have also recently recognized that the uptake of S 3 s by cartilage was increased when the sulfur tracer was injected as early as 6 hours after administration of vitamin D. Furthermore, Dziewiatkowski has discovered that when S 35 -sulfate was given to rachitic rats without vitamin D, the rate of synthesis of chondroitin sulfate was comparable to that of animals treated at the same time with vitamin D. He postulated that vitamin D must stimulate the utilization of chondroitin sulfate so that the increased synthesis in the presence of this vitamin would be secondary to the stepped-up utilization. These observations as well as the generally recognized delayed <b>mineralization</b> <b>indicate</b> that a series of events must take place in the growth centers of bones as part of the healing process previous to the appearance of calcification. The present study of normal and healing rachitic chicks has brought forward results which tend to reinforce this opinion and increase our understanding of the factors involved...|$|R

A periodic monitoring of discharge rate, EC, water temperature, and pH {{was performed in}} one of them (Lower Anzur spring) and water samples were collected for chemical analysis. Physicochemical data were used to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the functioning of the system. Temporal evolution of the controlled parameters reveals a markedly karst behavior. PCA has defined two principal factors, one related to salinity and other linked to infiltration processes (NO 3 −, Ca 2 +).

30|$|The {{decrease}} in organic carbon during the vermicomposting process indicates complete degredation, maturity, mineralization and waste decomposition (Hait and Tare 2011). Earthworms and microbes in the feed mixtures activates microbial respiration and degradation of organic wastes, thereby increases {{the loss of}} organic carbon during the vermicomposting process (Garg and Kaushik 2005; Suthar 2006). C:N ratio is an important parameter used for determining the vermicompost maturity and stability. The C:N ratio reduction in the final vermicompost <b>indicates</b> rapid <b>mineralization</b> and decomposition of the initial raw material and is mostly used parameter for stability and maturity of organic wastes (Suthar 2008; Garg and Gupta 2011; Singh et al. 2014). According to Suthar and Singh (2008), the loss of carbon and addition of nitrogen during the vermicomposting process reduces the C:N ratio in the end product. A C:N ratio of < 20 confirms organic waste <b>mineralization</b> which <b>indicates</b> compost maturity; however, a C:N ratio of < 12 is also preferred for agricultural purpose (Shak et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{determination}} of maturity {{and stability of}} vermicompost is essential {{before it can be}} used for agricultural application. Use of instrumental techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, TG and UV-vis spectroscopy analysis revealed major beneficial transformations and featured changes in the characteristics of organic wastes during the process of vermicomposting. The physico-chemical and biological parameters also confirmed rapid decomposition and mineralization by earthworms. None of the techniques give us the exact information on the maturity of vermicompost that is why different techniques have been used for evaluation of vermicompost maturity. The results of many authors revealed that these techniques confirmed complete organic matter <b>mineralization</b> which <b>indicates</b> the vermicompost attains maturity and stability and thus can be applied for agricultural purposes. Quality of the end product of any vermicomposting process has been always an important issue for commercial application of this technology. Use of sophisticated techniques/instruments will help to solve the use of end product as good manure for end users.|$|R

However, the transcriptional profiles and cellular functions of human aortic VICs (hAVICs) and mitral VICs (hMVICs) have not been directly compared. We performed NimbleGen gene expression profiling analyses of hAVICs and hMVICs. Seventy-eight known genes were differentially expressed between hAVICs and hMVICs. Higher expression of NKX 2 - 5, TBX 15, OGN, OMD, and CDKN 1 C and lower expression of TBX 5, MMP 1, and PCDH 10 were found in hAVICs compared to hMVICs. The differences in these genes, excepting OGN and OMD, remained in rheumatic VICs. We also compared cell proliferation, migration, and response to mineralization medium. hMVICs proliferated more quickly but showed more calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity than hAVICs after culture in <b>mineralization</b> medium, <b>indicating</b> that hMVICs were more susceptible to in vitro calcification. Our findings reveal differences in the transcription profiles and cellular functions of hAVICs and hMVICs...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} gross N fluxes by 15 N pool dilution in a coarse-textured {{agricultural soil}} when 15 N {{was applied to}} the soil NH 4 + pool by either: (i) mixing a 15 NH 4 NO 3 solution into disturbed soil or (ii) injection of 15 NH 3 gas into intact soil cores. The two techniques produced similar results for gross N <b>mineralization</b> rates <b>indicating</b> that NH 4 + production in soil was not altered by soil disturbance, method of application (gas vs. solution), or amount of N applied. This was not the case for immobilization rates, which were twofold higher when 15 N label {{was applied to the}} soil NH 4 + pool with the mixing technique compared to the injection technique. This was attributed to the fact that more NH 4 + was applied with the mixing technique. Estimates of gross nitrification were accompanied by large error terms meaning differences between 15 N labeling methods could not be accurately assessed for this process rate...|$|R

40|$|Late Permian kuroko-type {{mineralization}} in the Bully Hill {{area of the}} East Shasta district formed along two horizons {{within the}} Bully Hill rhyolite. In the Bully Hill, Rising Star, and Copper city mine areas, syngenetic mineralization is underlain by alteration zones characterized by addition of SiO₂ and K₂O, loss of NaCO, CaO, and Fe₂O₃*, and the assemblage quartz + sericite + pyrite. Quartz precipitation in the upper portion of the zones led to cyclic sealing of fluid flow, rupturing of the seal, quartz supers aturation, focused fluid discharge, and formation of sulfide mounds on the seafloor. Syngenetic mineralization occurred in several stages: (1) deposition of fine-grained banded sulfides and gangue; (2 a) recrystallization of Stage 1 minerals, and void-filling by pyrite + weakly chalcopyrite-diseased sphalerite ± barite; (2 b) deposition of coarsely-crystalline pyrite + heavily chalcopyrite-diseased sphalerite; (3 a) void-filling and replacement by galena + chalcopyrite + tetrahedrite-tennantite; (3 b) replacement by chalcopyrite; and (4) replacement by barite. ΣSO₄⁼ and H₂S contents of hydrothermal fluids decreased from Stages 2 a to 3 a. δ³⁴S values of sulfides increased successively from Stages 1 (- 15. 8 per mil) to 3 a (3. 0 per mil), reflecting variable inputs of biogenic sulfur and deep-seated fluid evolution. δ³⁴S values of syngenetic barites range from 12. 4 to 22. 5 per mil, reflecting cold seawater and hydrothermal sulfur sources, respectively. δ³⁴S values of epigenetic pyrite and barite within the alteration zones range from - 0. 7 to 2. 7 per mil and 12. 4 to 24. 1 per mil, respectively. Primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions in epigenetic minerals have filling temperatures of 240 to 260 °C and salinities of 3 to 12. 3 equivalent weight percent NaCl. Lower limits of fluid salinities and δ³⁴S values of barite indicate that seawater was a primary component of the hydrothermal fluid, and that seawater also mixed with discharging fluids on the seafloor. High fluid salinities, {{the lack of a}} silica source, and the close link of magmatism with <b>mineralization</b> <b>indicate</b> that magmatic fluids may have been {{an important component of the}} hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
