5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These insects are known as entomophagous parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause <b>more</b> <b>deaths</b> of humans than any other animal.|$|E

5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in <b>more</b> <b>deaths</b> than cures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1950 and 1974, 85 {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclones impacted the state, which collectively resulted in about $7billion (2017USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricanes Donna and Dora. Additionally, the storms were directly responsible for 93 fatalities and indirectly for 23 <b>more</b> <b>deaths.</b> Several tropical cyclones produced over 20inches (500mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy, which is the highest total during the period. The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 8 systems. The 1954 and 1967 seasons were the only years during the period in which a storm did not affect the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} effect was felt early, {{as the storm}} struck during Labor Day weekend, traditionally the final summer vacation weekend in the United States. Many hotel reservations from South Carolina to Florida were cancelled as people, seeing the destruction caused weeks earlier by Hurricane Charley, decided to avoid the coastal areas for safety.

Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded homes. At {{the height of the}} storm, high-voltage electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of Tampico and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two <b>more</b> <b>deaths</b> were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through contaminated water. Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) of rain and claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings. Landslides left dozens of communities isolated, and more than 600residents fled from flooded areas, particularly in Ciudad Valles, Tamazunchale, El Naranjo, and Xilitla.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{who could}} leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer <b>more</b> <b>deaths</b> during the next year.|$|E
