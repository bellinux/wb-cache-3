50|$|A {{floating}} {{island is}} a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> aquatic plants, mud, and peat ranging in thickness {{from a few}} inches to several feet.

40|$|As Director of the Apollo-Gaia Project 1 I {{have spent}} the last seven years working on {{feedback}} dynamics and acceleration in the global climate system 2. What {{is going on in the}} Arctic area at the moment is probably the fastest moving response to global warming and climate change anywhere on the planet. 1 Executive Summary Strong and interactive feedback processes are driving change in the Arctic climate faster than anywhere else on the planet. This over-view of Arctic Dynamics is firmly grounded in observational data (in sharp contrast with computer models which are struggling to play catch-up). Four multi-decadal parameters are presented dealing with: � Regional temperature change (in the context of global behaviour) � Area <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> sea ice � Volume (or <b>mass)</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> sea ice � Change in the decadal rate <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> loss <b>of</b> the <b>floating</b> sea ice.

25|$|Medusa fishes are {{a family}} Centrolophidae of 31 species of perciform fishes. They {{are found in}} {{temperate}} and tropical waters throughout the world, usually feeding on fish, crustaceans and small squid near rough sea floors on continental shelf and slope. Examples are barrelfish, southern driftfish, imperial blackfish, the Japanese and pelagic butterfish, the New Zealand and Tasmanian ruffe, and the common, silver and white warehou. The young of some species associate with jellyfish, which provides them with protection from predators and opportunities to scavenge {{the remains of the}} jellyfish's meals. The young of other species associate with large <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> kelp.|$|R
5000|$|Although it is {{believed}} that the melting <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> ice shelves will not raise sea levels, technically, there is a small effect because sea water is ~2.6% more dense than fresh water combined with the fact that ice shelves are overwhelmingly [...] "fresh" [...] (having virtually no salinity); this causes the volume of the sea water needed to displace a floating ice shelf to be slightly less than the volume of the fresh water contained in the floating ice. Therefore, when a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> ice melts, sea levels will increase; however, this effect is small enough that if all extant sea ice and floating ice shelves were to melt, the corresponding sea level rise is estimated to be ~4 cm.|$|R
50|$|Pairs nest {{in a large}} pad of {{interwoven}} reed flags, etc., on a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> debris or amongst matted reeds {{slightly above}} water level in swamps, clumps of rushes in paddocks or long unkempt grass. Each bird can lay 3-6 speckled eggs, pale yellowish stone to reddish buff, blotched and spotted with reddish brown. The incubation period is 23-27 days, and is performed by both sexes. The precocious chicks are feathered with downy black feathers and able to leave the nest soon after hatching, but will often remain in the nest for a few days. Young chicks are fed by their parents (and group members) for between 10-14 days, after which they begin to feed themselves.|$|R

Now Dan {{was a big man}} and he had a stentorian voice, deep like booming thunder. No man ever swore as Dan swore then. It was terrible. It was justified. But it was funny, and despite all this agony of disappointment, despite the other boat heading into the tuna and putting them down, I laughed till I cried.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is {{the largest}} <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> ice, located {{to the east of}} the Antarctic Peninsula with an area of about 449, 000 square kilometres. The work {{presented}} here is part of the international ERS AO 3 Vectra project. One objective is a high quality map of surface motion. We summarize some of the first results obtained by interferometric processing of more than 80 ERS single look complex (SLC) scenes, covering an area of approximately 140, 000 square kilometres near the ice front, including a comparison with results of numerical model studies. Coherence is present over a time interval of up to 18 days. The INSAR processor was developed at the Institute of Navigation with the capability to handle large data volumes. Aspects of the mosaicking of SLC data sets will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Velocity {{may have}} {{observed}} pumice sea rafts (<b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> pumice ejected from an underwater volcano) traversing the Sandy Island area in 1876 and mistakenly recorded {{them as an}} island. This explanation {{is supported by a}} 2004 study of an eruption of a volcano near Tonga that found that pumice sea rafts associated with that eruption traveled more than 3000 kilometers westward. An analysis of the pumice trajectory revealed that pumice rafts passed within 20 kilometers of the location of Sandy Island, approximately 200 days after the initial eruption. A study of coral migration from Tonga to the Great Barrier Reef found pumice rafts to be the mode of transportation, with a predicted path consistent with the 2004 study. Wind and ocean surface currents in the area may combine to funnel pumice rafts through the area between Fiji and New Caledonia on their way to Australia.|$|R

There was a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the hot engine, and it whisked itself into the air again, while the huge flat body drew itself together as if in sudden pain. I dipped to a vol-pique, but again a tentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller as easily as it might have cut through a smoke wreath. A long, gliding, sticky, serpent-like coil came from behind and caught me round the waist, dragging me out of the fuselage. I tore at it, my fingers sinking into the smooth, glue-like surface, and for an instant I disengaged myself, but only to be caught round the boot by another coil, which gave me a jerk that tilted me almost on to my back.|$|R

40|$|Cornops aquaticum (juveniles, adults) was {{monitored}} on 5 m(2) <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> Eichhornia crassipes in a whitewater floodplain near Manaus {{during one}} year. Its abundance and biomass varied {{as a consequence}} of changing host plant densities caused by the flood pulse of the Solimoes/Amazon River.

Average development from oviposition to adult took 71 or 81 days, respectively, the nymphal phase lasting 41 or 54 days. Longevity was 3. 2 months in males and 5. 8 months in females. The average food intake per g dry weight (dw) grasshopper (five nymphal instars) per day was approximately 0. 9 g dw of Eichhornia leaves. Given a daily net primary production of 15 g m⁻²dw of E. crassipes, estimated food intake was 16. 7 %.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{simplified}} formula for added <b>mass</b> coefficients <b>of</b> a two-dimensional <b>floating</b> body moving vertically in a finite water depth. Floating bodies with various sectional areas may represent simplified structure sections transformed by Lewis form, and can be used for floating body motion analysis using strip theory or another relevant method. Since the added <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> a <b>floating</b> body varies with wave frequency and water depth, a correction factor is developed to take these effects into account. Using a developed two-dimensional numerical wave tank technique, the reference added masses are calculated for various water depths at high frequency, and used them as basis values to formulate the correction factors. To verify the effectiveness of the developed formulas, the predicted heave added mass coefficients for various wetted body sections and wave frequencies are compared with numerical results from the Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) technique...|$|R
