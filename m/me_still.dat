500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for <b>me</b> <b>still</b> belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause button of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1696 Marlborough, {{together}} with Godolphin, Russell and Shrewsbury, was yet again implicated in a treasonous plot with JamesII, this time instigated by the Jacobite militant John Fenwick. The accusations were eventually {{dismissed as a}} fabrication and Fenwick executed – the King himself had remained incredulous – {{but it was not}} until 1698, a year after the Treaty of Ryswick brought an end to the Nine Years' War, that the corner was finally turned in William's and Marlborough's relationship. On the recommendation of Lord Sunderland (whose wife was a close friend of Lady Marlborough), William eventually offered Marlborough the post of governor to the Duke of Gloucester, Anne's eldest son; he was also restored to the Privy Council, {{together with}} his military rank. When William left for Holland in July Marlborough was one of the Lords Justices left running the country in his absence; but striving to reconcile his close Tory connections with that of the dutiful royal servant was difficult, leading Marlborough to complain – [...] "The King's coldness to <b>me</b> <b>still</b> continues".|$|E
500|$|As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 {{blockbuster}} Die Another Day, Berry recreated a {{scene from}} Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier. Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage. Berry has said of the scene: [...] "It's splashy", [...] "exciting", [...] "sexy", [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "it will keep <b>me</b> <b>still</b> out there after winning an Oscar". The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try to stay warm. According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time. Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation. After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.|$|E

500|$|He went on {{to serve}} in Northern Ireland as {{adjutant}} to 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), and {{was present at the}} events of Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972, when 13protesters were shot dead by soldiers from 1 PARA in Derry. He was in the tactical headquarters of the Army's operation to contain the protests immediately before the shooting began and he accompanied the battalion commander, Derek Wilford, when Wilford decided to join the soldiers on the ground. The shooting was over by the time Jackson reached the soldiers' position, but he recalls seeing several bodies in the back of an Army vehicle. In 1976, he was promoted to major and attended the Staff College, Camberley, before being posted to Germany as chief of staff to the Berlin Infantry Brigade. After Berlin, Jackson served his second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time as a company commander. While there, he witnessed the aftermath of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush, the British Army's single largest loss of life during The Troubles. He acted as the incident commander, arriving on the scene shortly after the second explosion, and had to identify Major Peter Fursman, a close friend, from the remains of Fursman's face, which had been blown clear of his skull. He later spoke of the effect the incident had on him, saying, [...] "It greatly disturbed <b>me.</b> <b>Still</b> does". He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours and was mentioned in despatches in 1981, in recognition of his service in Northern Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|Still <b>Me</b> <b>Still</b> Now {{continued}} in the same style as the previous album, being mostly light-pop music. [...] "Don't Cry Your Heart Out" [...] was radio-friendly pop, but songs such as [...] "Diamonds" [...] and [...] "No Regrets" [...] were arranged in a style reminiscent of musicals. Some reviews wondered about the song selections, but Deasismont's voice was praised nevertheless. [...] The selected songs were alleged {{by some to be}} unsuitable for Amy and her audience, {{but on the other hand}} her potential was appreciated.|$|E

2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. He looked over at <b>me,</b> <b>still</b> in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E

My brother talked to me all day long about Cambridge, and what he thought I ought to do. My imagination was fired. It seemed to me – it seems to <b>me</b> <b>still</b> – the most splendid thing in the world for a young fellow to go to the University; there to contend with young giants; and, if he can, to keep his field and be victorious." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2006, Deasismont {{took part}} in the Diggiloo tour, where she performed, among other songs, Edith Piaf's [...] "Non, je ne regrette rien". Although Still <b>Me</b> <b>Still</b> Now wasn't as big a success outside Sweden as This Is Me Now, it was still popular in her home country. She also held concerts beyond the Diggiloo tour; readers of the largest evening newspaper, Aftonbladet, voted her 2006 Summer Tour Queen. She {{released}} two more singles in late 2006, Big Guns and It Can Only Get Better, and continued to appear on television, including appearances on such prime-time shows as Sommarkrysset, Go'kväll, and Vinterkrysset. In January 2007, she started a fan club that publishes a quarterly fan magazine called Amy Diamond Fanzine. Lastly, in September 2007 she sang with In The Ghetto on Elvis – The Original Cast.|$|E

[...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw <b>me</b> <b>still</b> sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.'

2500|$|Kirkcaldy harbour was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} [...] "a sheltered cove round the East Burn", thus giving easy accessibility for boats. By the early 16th century the vessels of the harbour {{had begun to}} engage in trade with the Baltic; later dealing with the import of grain in 1618 and continental beer in 1625. A shipbuilding trade also existed on the site until this was phased out temporarily in 1645. The success led {{to the growth of}} the burgh, surrounding the harbour, Main Street and Tiel (West) burn, commented on by Thomas Carlyle. During his stay he described the town as being [...] "a mile of the smoothest sand, with one long wave coming on gently, steadily, and breaking into a gradual explosion beautifully sounding, and advancing, ran from the South to the North, from the West Burn to Kirkcaldy Harbour, a favourite scene beautiful to <b>me</b> <b>still</b> in the faraway".|$|E
2500|$|Deasismont {{signed a}} {{distribution}} deal with Warner in July {{in order to}} promote the album internationally. She never appeared with her band again, instead performing with a background track and dancers. The album became popular also in other Nordic countries and Poland during the following summer. [...] "What's In It For Me" [...] was heard frequently on the radio, becoming the 19th most played song of 2005 in Finland and 16th best songs of 2005 in Poland. More singles from the albums [...] "Welcome to the City" [...] and [...] "Champion" [...] were released in the summer. A special edition of the album was released for the Central European market. It contained two previously-unreleased songs which would later appear on Still <b>Me</b> <b>Still</b> Now. She was sent on a promotional tour throughout Central Europe in late 2005. Her record deal allowed the whole family to travel with her whenever the concerts were abroad. She performed on television in Germany, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania and the Netherlands.|$|E

2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts <b>me</b> <b>still</b> since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears...
