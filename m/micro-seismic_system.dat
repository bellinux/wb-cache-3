40|$|International audienceErosion of rock cliffs {{has been}} {{considered}} to be relatively unpredictable. This perceived stochastic nature of the erosional processes often occurs through collapses along fractures in the rock-mass. The prediction of catastrophic cliff failures and collapses remains very difficult. For advancing in this field, {{it is important to}} understand the processes through which a crack is initiated, how it develops and propagates until the final failure. This paper examines the micro-seismic signals recorded 15 h prior to a rock-fall located at Mesnil-Val, France. The results lead to the hypothesis that several phases of failure mechanisms contribute to rock-fall occurrence. The most important phases were associated with micro-seismic event families identified by multiplet selection. Each event family contained one specific frequency spectrum showing a progressive decrease of the frequencies as the rock approached failure suggesting the following phases: 1) the micro-seismic events recorded 15 h before the rock-fall were characterised by the highest frequencies in a large spectrum-band, between ~ 100 and 1000 Hz (family 1), suggesting a crack initiation mechanism or the opening of existing fractures; 2) the micro-seismic events recorded several minutes before the rock-fall were associated with a clear decrease in the highest frequency components (family 2) suggesting that the mechanism was related to the growing and development (or coalesce) of existing micro-cracks into larger fractures; 3) micro-seismic events recorded just before the rock-fall were associated with a lower frequency spectrum than families 1 and 2, the highest frequency components were absent (family 3), the frequency emission source mechanism could be related to the shearing or opening of the existing large fractures permitting the complete detachment of the blocky rock-mass; 4) finally, micro-seismic events with a very low frequency spectrum (lower than 100 Hz) characterized the rock-fall impact on the ground. These encouraging results offer the possibility of using the <b>micro-seismic</b> <b>system</b> to monitor high risk sections of coastline and to advance understanding of cliff failure mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{establishment}} {{and application of}} the Mine <b>Micro-seismic</b> Monitoring <b>System</b> (MMS), provides a powerful method not only to monitor and predict the mine geological hazard, but also to monitor and prevent against the illegal mining. While there was illegal mining, the system can give you the information including the 3 -dimensional spatial coordinates in real time [...] The monitoring against the illegal mining was aimed at the blast events, so the blast events should be collected and analyzed specially. On the other hand, {{the energy of the}} blast events are larger enough to be easily recognized and be 3 -d located and then be analyzed by the MMS, and then the satisfied information can be given by the MMS. This kind of usage of the system has been analyzed and confirmed by a practical example...|$|R
40|$|Coal bump {{refers to}} a sudden catastrophic failure of coal seam and usually can cause serious damages to {{underground}} mining facilities and staff. In this circumstance, this paper focuses on the recent achievements in the mechanism and prevention techniques of coal bumps {{over the past five}} years in China. Based on theoretical analysis, laboratory experiment, numerical simulation and field test, the characteristics of coal bumps occurrence in China's coal mines were described, and the difference between coal bumps and rockbursts was also discussed. In addition, three categories of coal bumps induced by “material failure” were introduced, i. e. hard roof, floor strata and tectonic structures, in which the mechanism of coal bumps induced by geological structures was analyzed. This involves the bump liability and microstructure effects on bump-prone coal failure, the mechanism of coal bumps in response to fault reactivation, island face mining or hard roof failure. Next, the achievements in the monitoring and controlling methods of coal bumps were reviewed. These methods involve the incorporated prediction system of micro-seismicity and mining-induced pressure, the distributed <b>micro-seismic</b> monitoring <b>system,</b> energy absorption support system, bolts with constant resistance and large elongation, and the “multi-stage” high-performance support. Finally, an optimal mining design is desirable for the purpose of coal bump mitigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the capabilities of seismic noise data for detection of landslide sliding surfaces using the H/V spectral ratio (Nakamura method). The case study is Passo della Morte landslide, located in the Nord East of Italy (Carnic Alps) along the left side of the Tagliamento River. Its surface is approximately 530 thousand m 2 and movements are up to 5 cm/year of on most active zones. The risk associated with this phenomenon is the interference with a National Road (N. R. 52) and two road tunnels. Moreover, Tagliamento River flowing at the landslide toe, a possible damming has to be taken into account. Several studies have been carried out to characterize the landslide behavior, via multiple displacement measuring techniques (laser scanner, GPS, extensimeter, inclinometer, TDR), <b>micro-seismic</b> monitoring <b>systems</b> (seismometer and acoustic emission sensor) and seismic survey (GPR and seismic refraction). The main objectives of this investigation are: determine the depth of landslide sliding surface in various sites and reconstruct its geometry by applying the law [f 0 =Vs/ 4 H] to the resonance frequencies found with Nakamura method. Measurements sites have been set 200 m apart on a regular grid covering all the surface to be monitored. Seismic noise has been recorded using a Lennartz seismometer (LE- 3 D/ 5 s) connected to a Quanterra Q 330 (Kinemetrics) acquisition system. Results have been validated by means of several boreholes performed in the examined area. On the other hand, the H/V spectral ratios in the horizontal plane as a function of the azimuth have been analyzed in order to investigate the directivity in seismic site response on the landslide. The results obtained with this work will be presented...|$|R
30|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} complex propagation of hydraulic fractures induced by volumetric fracturing with different numerical simulation approaches. Dahi-Taleghani and Olson (2009), Dahi-Taleghani (2010) and Keshavarzi et al. (2012) used a two-dimensional finite element method to simulate the complex fracture propagation. In this model, a uniform and constant net pressure is loaded {{on the surface of}} the hydraulic fractures. Olson (2008) and Olson and Dahi-Taleghani (2009) presented a pseudo-three-dimensional complex fracture network model based on the displacement discontinuity method, which considered the injection of non-Newtonian fluids, Carter filtration, random non-planar propagation and fracture height extension in three layers. Zhao and Young (2009) used a two-dimensional particle discrete element method, where the model consists of cohesive particles and pore space between these particles. The pore pressure will increase with the injection of the fracturing fluid, and it will remove the cohesion between particles. The simulated natural fractures are non-cohesive or weakly cohesive. Nagel et al. (2011) and Zangeneh et al. (2012) used a discrete element method to simulate the complex fracture network system. In this model, the rock mass is divided by multiple joints. The fractures only propagate along the joint network. No new hydraulic fractures occur and grow except the initial natural fractures. In recent years, the simulation technology of a complex fracture network has been developed, which combines with a <b>micro-seismic</b> imaging <b>system</b> to represent the complexity of hydraulic fractures. There are two primary models. One is the wire mesh model (Xu and Ghassemi 2009; Xu et al. 2010; Meyer and Bazan 2011), which can effectively simulate the complexity of fractures and the spacing between perpendicular fractures; another one is the unconventional fracture model (Weng et al. 2011), which describes complex geological conditions and evaluates the propagation of complex fractures more strictly. However, the extended finite element and boundary element method may not apply various hydraulic pressures on the fracture surface, and also does not consider the impact of seepage and leak off of fracturing fluids; the discrete element method restricts the path of hydraulic fractures.|$|R

The area around the Broke township (located in the north-west of the Sydney Basin) has had coal seam gas exploration activities over the last decade. One methodology of well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing, {{has the potential to}} cause some environmental problems. The Broke region includes 4 aquifers (3 confined and semi-confined), more than 3 major coal seams (3 gas bearing) and has been covered by variety of different sedimentary rocks of Permian age. The groundwater system, with the gas bearing deposits is the function of conductivity and storativity (K and S) of the coal seam and geometry of properties of the fractures. The required data to investigate the hydraulic properties in the fractured zone includes; corehole data to assessment the geology and underground <b>system,</b> <b>micro-seismic</b> data to infer the fracture properties, pumping tests results, and monitoring wells data to evaluate the hydraulic properties of the coal seams. This paper investigates the shape of drawdown curves, resulting from the hydraulic pumping tests at Broke performed to determine the hydraulic and fracture properties, such as length, width, conductivity of fractures, and the proportion of the water and gas contained in the targeted coal seam. In order to reduce data uncertainty and increase the reliability of the hydraulic property estimation the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) will be applied. Finally, with investigation of the shape (length and width) and conductivity of the fractures, the best monitoring method to ensure public safety of provide assurances that if problems occur the monitoring system will provide early warning for this study area will be determined...|$|R
