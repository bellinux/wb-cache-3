[...] Yanbu'a of the Sea is {{so called}} to {{distinguish}} it from [...] "Yanbu'a of the Palm-Grounds," [...] a village {{at the foot of}} the mountains, about 18 or 20 miles distant from the sea-port. Ali Bey places it one day's journey E.1/4N.E. from Yanbu'a al-Bahr, and describes it as a pleasant place in a fertile valley. It is now known as Yambu'a al-Nakhil. See [...] "The Land of Midian (Revisited)." [...] [FN#2] The first quarter of the Cairo caravan is Al-Akabah; the second is the Manhal Salmah (Salmah's place for watering camels); the third is Yambu'; and the fourth Meccah. [FN#3] The Nizam, as Europeans now know, is the regular Turkish infantry. In Al-Hijaz, these troops are not stationed in small towns like Yambu'. At such places a party of Irregular horse, for the purpose of escorting travellers, is deemed sufficient. The Yambu' police seems to consist of the Sharif's sturdy negroes. In Ali Bey's time Yambu' belonged to the Sharif of Meccah, and was garrisoned by him. [FN#4] This, as far as I could learn, is the only tax which the Sultan's government derives from the northern Hijaz; the people declare it to be, as one might expect at this distance from the capital, liable to gross peculation. When the Wahhabis held Yambu', they assessed it, like all other places; for which reason their name is held in the liveliest abhorrence. [FN#5] Civilians usually stick one pistol in the belt; soldiers and fighting men two, or more, with all the necessary concomitants of pouches, turnscrews, and long iron ramrods, which, opening with a screw, disclose a long thin pair of pincers, wherewith fire is put upon the chibuk. [FN#6] The weapons with which nations are to be managed form a curious consideration. The Englishman tamely endures a staff, which would make a Frenchman mad with anger; and a Frenchman respects a sabre, which would fill an Englishman's bosom with civilian spleen. You order the Egyptian to strip and be flogged; he makes no objection to seeing his blood flow in this way; but were a cutting weapon used, his friends would stop at nothing in their fury. [FN#7] In Arabia, generally, the wound is less considered by justice and revenge, than the instrument with which it was inflicted. Sticks and stones are held to be venial weapons: guns and pistols, swords and daggers, are felonious. [FN#8] Europeans inveigh against this article,-which represents the [...] "loup" [...] of Louis XIV.'s time,-for its hideousness and jealous concealment of charms made to be admired. It is, on the contrary, the most coquettish article of woman's attire, excepting, perhaps, the Lisam of Constantinople. It conceals coarse skins, fleshy noses, wide mouths, and vanishing chins, whilst it sets off to best advantage what in these lands is almost always lustrous and liquid-the eye. Who has not remarked this at a masquerade ball? [FN#9] A certain stipend allowed by the Sultan to citizens of the Haramayn (Meccah and Al-Madinah). It will be treated of at length in a future chapter. [FN#10] The Shaykh, or agent of the camels, without whose assistance it would be difficult to hire beasts. He brings the Badawin with him; talks them over to fair terms; sees the [...] "Arbun," [...] or earnest-money, delivered to them; and is answerable for their not failing in their engagement. [FN#11] The not returning [...] "Salam" [...] was a sign on the part of the Badawin that they were out to fight, and not to make friends; and the dromedary riders, who generally travel without much to rob, thought this behaviour a declaration of desperate designs. The Badawin asked if they were Al-Madinah men; because the former do not like, unless when absolutely necessary, to plunder the people of the Holy City. And the Daghistanis said their destination was Bir Abbas, a neighbouring, instead of Yambu', a distant post, because those who travel on a long journey, being supposed to have more funds with them, are more likely to be molested. [FN#12] [...] "Miyan," [...] the Hindustani word for [...] "Sir," [...] is known to the Badawin all over Al-Hijaz; they always address Indian Moslems with this word, which has become contemptuous, on account of the low esteem in which the race is held. [FN#13] That is to say, sneaks and cowards. I was astonished to see our Maghrabi fellow-passengers in the bazar at Yambu' cringing and bowing to us, more like courtiers than Badawin. Such, however, is the effect of a strange place upon Orientals generally. In the Persians such humility was excusable; in no part of Al-Hijaz are they for a moment safe from abuse and blows. [FN#14] The night prayer. [FN#15] [...] "Amm" [...] means literally a paternal uncle. In the Hijaz it is prefixed to the names of respectable men, who may also be addressed [...] "Ya Amm Jamal!" [...] (O Uncle Jamal!) To say [...] "Ya Ammi!" [...] (O my Uncle!) is more familiar, and would generally be used by a superior addressing an inferior. [FN#16] Jizyat properly means the capitation tax levied on Infidels; in this land of intense pride, the Badawin, and even the town-chiefs, apply the opprobrious term to blackmail extorted from travellers, even of their own creed. [FN#17] The Shugduf of Al-Hijaz differs greatly from that used in Syria and other countries. It is composed of two corded cots 5 feet long, slung horizontally, about half-way down, and parallel with the camel's sides. These cots have short legs, and at the halt may be used as bedsteads; the two are connected together by loose ropes, attached to the inner long sides of the framework, and these are thrown over the camel's packsaddle. Thick twigs inserted in the ends and the outer long sides of the framework, are bent over the top, bower-fashion, to support matting, carpets, and any other protection against the sun. There is an opening in this kind of wicker-work in front (towards the camel's head), through which you creep; and a similar one behind creates a draught of wind. Outside, towards the camel's tail, are pockets containing gullehs, or earthenware bottles, of cooled water. Inside, attached to the wickerwork, are large provision pouches, similar to those used in old-fashioned travelling chariots. At the bottom are spread the two beds. The greatest disadvantage of the Shugduf is the difficulty of keeping balance. Two men ride in it, and their weights must be made to tally. Moreover, it is liable to be caught and torn by thorn trees, to be blown off in a gale of wind; and its awkwardness causes the camel repeated falls, which are most likely to smash it. Yet it is not necessarily an uncomfortable machine. Those for sale in the bazar are, of course, worthless, being made of badly seasoned wood. But private litters are sometimes pleasant vehicles, with turned and painted framework, silk cordage, and valuable carpets. The often described [...] "Mahmil" [...] is nothing but a Syrian Shugduf, royally ornamented. [FN#18] [...] " [...] Exquisites." [...] [FN#19] It is the same rule with the Arab, on the road as at home; the more he is dressed the greater is his respectability. For this reason, you see Sharifs and other men of high family, riding or walking in their warm camel's hair robes on the hottest days. Another superstition of the Arabs is this, that thick clothes avert the evil effects of the sun's beams, by keeping out heat. To the kindness of a friend-Thomas Seddon-I owe the admirable sketch of an [...] "Arab Shaykh in his Travelling Dress." [...] [FN#20] Sharifs and other great men sometimes bind a white turband or a Cashmere shawl round the kerchief, to keep it in its place. The Aakal varies in every part of the country. Here it is a twist of dyed wool, there a bit of common rope, three or four feet long. Some of the Arab tribes use a circlet of wood, composed of little round pieces, the size of a shilling, joined side by side, and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The Eastern Arabs wear a large circle of brown wool, almost a turband in itself. In Barbary, they twist brightcoloured cloth round a rope, and adorn it with thick golden thread. [FN#21] Generally written [...] "Thar," [...] the blood-revenge right, acknowledged by law and custom. (See Chapter xxiv. post.) [FN#22] Gold, however, as well as silk, I may be excused for repeating, is a forbidden article of ornament to the Moslem. [FN#23] The silver-hilted dagger is a sign of dignity: [...] "I would silver my dagger," [...] in idiomatic Hijazi, means, [...] "I would raise myself in the world." [...] [FN#24] Niebuhr has accurately described this article. It is still worn in the Madras army, though long discarded from the other presidencies; the main difference between the Indian and the Arab sandal is, that the former has a ring, into which the big toe is inserted, and the latter a thong, which is clasped between the big toe and its neighbour. Both of them are equally uncomfortable, and equally injurious to soldiers, whose legs fight as much as do their arms. They abrade the skin wherever the straps touch, expose the feet to the sun, wind, and rain, and admit thorns and flints to the toes and toe-nails. In Arabia, the traveller may wear, if he pleases, slippers, but they are considered townsman-like and effeminate. They must be of the usual colours, red or yellow. Black shoes, though almost universally worn by the Turks at Cairo and Constantinople, would most probably excite suspicion in Al-Hijaz. [FN#25] The Mizrak, as it is called, is peculiar to certain tribes, as the Karashi and the Lahyami, and some, like the Hudayli near Meccah, make very pretty as well as very useful darts. The head is 15 or 16 inches long, nowhere broader than an inch, and tapering gradually to a fine point; its shape is two shallow prisms joined at their bases, and its socket, round like that of all lances, measures a little less than 2 inches. The lower third of the blade only is adorned with bars, lozenges, and cones of brass let into the iron in zig-zag and other figures. The shaft is of hard pliant wood-I do not know of what tree-well seasoned with grease and use; it is 23 inches long, and strengthened and adorned at distances of half an inch apart by bands of fine brass wire, about one inch and a half long. The heel of the weapon is a blunt spike 14 inches long, used to stick it in the ground, and this, as well as the lower third of the blade, is ornamented with brass work. Being well balanced, the Mizrak is a highly efficient weapon for throwing in hunting, and by its handsome appearance adds not a little to the bearer's dignity. But the stranger must be careful how he so arms himself. Unless he be undistinguishable from a Badawi, by carrying a weapon peculiar to certain clans, he will expose himself to suspicion, or to laughter. And to offend an Arab of Al-Hijaz mortally, you have only to say bluntly, [...] "Sell me thy spear." [...] The proper style of address to the man whose necessities compel him to break through one of his [...] "points d'honneur," [...] is to say, [...] "Give me that javelin, and I will satisfy thee;" [...] after which he will haggle for each copper piece as though you were cheapening a sheep. [FN#26] The Mas'hab is of almond, generally brought from Syria; at the thick end is a kind of crook, formed by cutting off a bit of the larger branch from which the stick grows. This crook is afterwards cut into the shape useful to seize a camel's nose-ring, or a horse's bridle. Arabs of all degrees are fond of carrying these sticks. [It is also called Maghin.] [FN#27] This article, the Silahlik of the Turks, is composed of several oblong pieces of leather cut out to fit the front part of the body; between each fold there is room enough to stick a weapon; a substantial strap fastens it round the waist, and it serves to defend the sash or the shirt from iron mould, and the stains of gunpowder. It is made of all kinds of material, from plain Morocco leather to the richest velvet embroidered with gold. [FN#28] It is as well to have a good pair of Turkish barrels and stocks, fitted up with locks of European manufacture; those made by natives of these countries can never be depended upon. The same will apply to the gun or rifle. Upon the whole, it is more prudent to have flint locks. Copper caps are now sold in the bazars of Meccah and Al-Madinah, where a Colt's [...] "six-shooter" [...] might excite attention for a day; but were the owner in a position to despise notoriety, he might display it everywhere without danger. One of our guards, who was killed on the road, had a double-barrelled English fowling-piece. Still, when doubts must not be aroused, the traveller will do well to avoid, even in the civilised Hijaz, suspicious appearances in his weapons. I carried in a secret pocket a small pistol with a spring dagger, upon which dependence could be placed, and I was careful never to show it, discharging it and loading it always in the dark. Some men wear a little dagger strapped round the leg, below the knee. Its use is this: when the enemy gets you under, he can prevent you bringing your hand up to the weapon in your waist-belt; but before he cuts your throat, you may slip your fingers down to the knee, and persuade him to stop by a stab in the perineum. This knee dagger is required only in very dangerous places. The article I chiefly accused myself of forgetting was a stout English clasp-knife, with a large handle, a blade like an [...] "Arkansas toothpick," [...] and possessing the other useful appliances of picker, fleam, tweezers, lancet, and punch. [FN#29] Called [...] "Habak": these cords are made in great quantities at Cairo, which possesses a special bazar for them, and are exported to all the neighbouring countries, where their price considerably increases. A handsome pistol-cord, with its tassels, costs about 12 shillings in Egypt; at Meccah, or Al-Madinah, the same would fetch upwards of a pound sterling. [FN#30] My diary-book was made up for me by a Cairene; it was a long thin volume fitting into a breast-pocket, where it could be carried without being seen. I began by writing notes in the Arabic character, but as no risk appeared, my journal was afterwards kept in English. More than once, by way of experiment, I showed the writing on a loose slip of paper to my companions, and astonished them with the strange character derived from Solomon and Alexander, the Lord of the Two Horns, which we Afghans still use. For a short trip a pencil suffices; on long journeys ink is necessary; the latter article should be English, not Eastern, which is washed out clean the first time your luggage is thoroughly soaked with rain. The traveller may use either the Persian or the brass Egyptian inkstand; the latter, however, is preferable, being stronger and less likely to break. But, unless he be capable of writing and reading a letter correctly, it would be unadvisable to stick such an article in the waist-belt, as this gives out publicly that he is a scribe. When sketching, the pencil is the best, because the simplest and shortest mode of operation is required. Important lines should afterwards be <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> <b>ink,</b> as [...] "fixing" [...] is impossible on such journeys. For prudence sake, when my sketches were made, I cut up the paper into square pieces, numbered them for future reference, and hid them in the tin canisters that contained my medicines. [FN#31] An accident of this kind happened not long ago, in Hazramaut, to a German traveller who shall be nameless. He had the mortification to see his sketch-book, the labour of months, summarily appropriated and destroyed by the Arabs. I was told by a Hazramaut man at Cairo, and by several at Aden, that the gentleman had at the time a narrow escape with his life; the Badawin wished to put him to death as a spy, sent by the Frank to ensorceler their country, but the Shaykhs forbade bloodshed, and merely deported the offender. Travellers caught sketching are not often treated with such forbearance. [FN#32] All Arabs assert that it pains the loaded camel's feet to stand still, and, certainly, the [...] "fidgettiness" [...] of the animal to start, looks as if he had some reason to prefer walking. [FN#33] It often strains the camel to rise with a full Shugduf on his back, besides which the motion is certain to destroy the vehicle in a few days. Those who are unable to climb up the camel's neck usually carry with them a short ladder. [FN#34] Wassit means, [...] "go in the middle of the road"; Jannib, [...] "keep clear of the sides." [...] These words are fair specimens of how much may be said by two Arabic syllables. Ya hu (O, he) is an address common in Arabia as in Egypt, and Y'al Jammal (O camel-man) is perhaps a little more civil. [FN#35] The rivalry between the Sons of the two Holy Cities extends even to these parts: the Madanis contending for Yambu', the Meccans for Jeddah.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between growth, in vivo extensibility, and tissue {{tension in the}} first 3 internodes of 5, 6, and 7 day-old pea plants (Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska), grown under continuous red light was investigated. The upper 15 millimeters of each internode was <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> <b>ink</b> and its elongation growth measured over the next subsequent 8 hours. In vivo extensibility was measured by stretching living tissue at constant force (creep test) in a custom-built extensiometer. Tissue tension was determined by (a) measuring the rate of expansion of the isolated cortical cylinder after adding water {{and the amount of}} contraction of the epidermis after peeling, and (b) by use of the `split section test. ' A good correlation between rate of elongation growth, in vivo extensibility, and tissue tension was established. The epidermis peeled from the growing third internode of 7 day-old plants and measured immediately showed a plastic extensibility (Epl twice that of peels from nongrowing excised sections. This high Epl-value was lost on incubation of the sections in distilled water, and was subsequently restored by incubating the sections in auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid). We conclude that the in situ growth of the internodes is a function of tissue-tension, which provides the driving force of organ growth, and the extensibility (Epl of the outer epidermal wall, which is in the growing plant in a `loosened' state.

40|$|Background. Nd:YAP laser {{is widely}} used to {{investigate}} the nociceptive and pain systems, generating perpetual and laser-evoked neurophysiological responses. A major procedural concern {{for the use of}} Nd:YAP laser stimuli in experimental research is the risk of skin damage. The absorption of Nd:YAP laser stimuli is greater in darker skin, or in pale skin that has been darkened with ink, prompting some ethics boards to refuse approval to experimenters wishing to track stimulus location by marking the skin with ink. Some research questions, however, require laser stimuli to be delivered at particular locations or within particular zones, a requirement that is very difficult to achieve if marking the skin is not possible. We thoroughly searched the literature for experimental evidence and protocol recommendations for safe delivery of Nd:YAP laser stimuli over marked skin, but found nothing. Methods. We designed an experimental protocol to define safe parameters for the use of Nd:YAP laser stimuli over skin that has been marked with black dots, and used thermal imaging to assess the safety of the procedure at the forearm and the back. Results. Using thermal imaging and repeated laser stimulation to ink-marked skin, we demonstrated that skin temperature did not increase progressively across the course of the experiment, and that the small change in temperature seen at the forearm was reversed during the rest periods between blocks. Furthermore, no participant experienced skin damage due to the procedure. Conclusion. This protocol offers parameters for safe, confident and effective experimentation using repeated Nd:YAP laser on skin <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> <b>ink,</b> thus paving the way for investigations that depend on it...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} compared 4 field {{methods of}} evaluating the relative preference by sheep of 28 clones of saltbush (Atriplex halimus L.). The methods were as follows. 1) Leaf dots (LD) : 8 leaves per shrub were {{marked on the}} lower surface with a small dot using a water-resistant, nontoxic ink. 2) Twig marks (TM) : 2 current-year twigs per shrub were marked with 3 lines using the same ink approximately {{in the middle of}} the basal, median, and apical thirds. 3) Branch length (BL) : 2 branches per shrub were <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> <b>ink</b> at the base of the current year's growth. The twigs were measured from the marked point to the top, before and after sheep browsing. 4) Ocular estimation (OE) : the percentage of the total number of current-year twigs browsed was visually estimated for each shrub. The percentage of use was calculated by counting the residual dots (LD) or marks (TM) after browsing and by calculating the difference between the 2 measures in the BL method. The trial was conducted in August and repeated in November and in both grazing periods 4 observations were made. Highly significant differences among clones were observed. The different methods generally gave similar results for the ranking of the clones, but each method showed a different discriminatory capacity. On the basis of the F ratio, the OE method seemed more efficient, although results were subjective and mainly dependent on the experience and skill of the observer. Among the methods based on the counting or measurement of markers, the discriminatory capacity decreased from LD to BL and TM, but the opposite order was observed for the ease of setting and counting the markers...|$|E

The dye was visualized intraoperatively facilitating wedge resection of the tumor-bearing area with the Endo GIA. Results: The patient had an uneventful surgery and recovery. Complete excision of the tumor was accomplished. Conclusion: The preoperative endoscopic marking of gastric lesions, facilitates the intraoperative localization and resection of these lesions...|$|R

This hole is <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> a Bingo-style <b>ink</b> dauber, which is purposely larger than the hole. The voter then separates the ballot, chooses either the top or the bottom layer to keep as a receipt, and shreds the other layer. The receipt is scanned at the polling station for tabulation.|$|R
30|$|Under general anesthesia, 3  mL of indigocarmine were {{injected}} into the tumor side of the periareolar skin, followed by massage for 30  seconds. A 2  cm incision was made at the site <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> oil <b>ink</b> and the SLN was traced based on the lymphatic vessels dyed in blue. The removed sentinel nodes were immediately submitted to frozen section. After SLNB, total mastectomy was performed. Intraoperative pathological diagnosis showed no lymph node metastases, and axillary lymph node dissection was therefore deemed to be unnecessary. SLNs were fixed in formalin and pathologically examined. Thick tissue sections (2  mm in thickness) were cut from a paraffin block of SLNs. These sections were then stained with hematoxylin-eosin or immunostained with monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin.|$|R

In response, the government {{announced that it would}} start <b>marking</b> customers <b>with</b> indelible <b>ink.</b> This was in addition to other measures proposed to ensure that the exchange transactions are carried out only once by each person.|$|R
30|$|All {{parchment}} specimens (dimensions 0.6  ×  1.2  cm) {{were selected}} from the backbone area, <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> the two <b>ink</b> formulations on the corium face of the parchment according to a scheme described below. For a reliable evaluation of results, reference samples of ink-free parchment regions {{in close proximity to}} the ink areas were analysed in parallel. Due to inhomogeneity in parchment components, the distances of sampled spots for FTIR-ATR spectroscopy between inked and ink-free areas were kept below 6  mm.|$|R

[...] During the run-up to the Afghan parliamentary elections in September 2010, the Taliban intimidated villagers in certain areas from voting. People in the villages would not vote because the Taliban left letters at night warning they will cut off the finger of anyone if they find it <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> the indelible <b>ink</b> used to prevent multiple voting.|$|R
40|$|Extrinsic afferent neurons play an {{essential}} role in both sensation and reflex control of visceral organs, but their specialized morphological peripheral endings have never been functionally identified. Extracellular recordings were made from fine nerve trunks running between the vagus nerve and esophagus of the guinea pig. Mechanoreceptors, which responded to esophageal distension, fired spontaneously, had low thresholds to circumferential stretch, and were slowly adapting. Calibrated von Frey hairs (0. 12 mN) were used to probe the serosal surface at 100 – 200 sites, which were mapped on a video image of the live preparation. Each stretch-sensitive unit had one to three highly localized receptive fields (“hot spots”), which were <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> Indian <b>ink</b> applied on the tip of the von Frey hair. Recorded nerve trunks were then filled anterogradely, using biotinamide in an artificial intracellular solution. Receptive fields were consistently associate...|$|R

30|$|Most {{striking}} about the entries in Tables  3, 4 {{on the one}} hand, and Tables  5, 6 on the other hand, are the numerous differences in the individual entries. If the three tested algorithms were close to the above-mentioned unattainable ideal algorithm [16] and their default settings and internal parameters were optimally chosen by the programmers for the processing of our set of synthetic test images, one would naively expect that their extraction results are {{at least for the}} noise-free images in very good agreement. Obviously, this is not always the case. Results that are obviously incorrect (within any reasonable error bars) are <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> red <b>ink</b> in Tables  3 and 5. Blue markings in these two tables refer to entries that are not obviously incorrect but may appear to be so due to a program’s inability to extract the lattice parameters of a rectangular centered Bravais lattice.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dieulafoy’s lesion is a {{vascular}} malformation, usually of {{the stomach}} but occasionally of the small or large bowel. It is an uncommon, but clinically significant, source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Three cases {{have been reported in}} the literature of laparoscopic gastric wedge resection of these lesions by using intraoperative endoscopic localization. We present the only reported case of preoperative endoscopic localization of a Dieulafoy’s lesion <b>with</b> India <b>ink</b> and an endoscopic clip before laparoscopic resection. Case Report: We present an 82 -year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with 3 episodes of hematemesis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an actively bleeding Dieulafoy’s lesion in the fundus {{of the stomach}} along the greater curvature, which was controlled endoscopically. However, the patient had a recurrent episode of bleeding. Repeat endoscopy was performed and the lesion was tagged with 2 endoscopic clips and <b>marked</b> <b>with</b> India <b>ink.</b> A laparoscopic wedge resection was performed after the India ink was identified in the fundus. The patient did well postoperatively. Conclusion: Preoperative localization of a Dieulafoy’s lesion <b>with</b> India <b>ink</b> and endoscopic clips before laparoscopic wedge resection is a feasible procedure. Therefore, no need exists for intraoperative endoscopy to aid in the localization, as previously reported...|$|R
