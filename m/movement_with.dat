5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, pop-rock largely {{consisted}} of the radio-friendly glam metal bands, who used images derived from the British glam <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied by hard rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing. Bands from this era included many British groups like Def Leppard, as well as heavy metal-influenced American bands Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi and Van Halen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a {{worldwide}} <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define the time {{structure}} of leg movements during sleep occurring with an intermovement interval (onset-to-onset) shorter than 10  s in patients with restless legs syndrome and controls, and to compare it to the structure of <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> intervals of 10 - 90  s or > 90  s. Polysomnographic recordings of 141 untreated patients and 68 age-matched normal controls were analysed. All movements were detected and classified into three categories, separated by intervals of 90  s. The number of movements included in each category was significantly higher in patients than in controls. The <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> an interval of > 90  s occurred steadily during the night, whereas the hourly distribution of <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> intervals of 90  s. The time structure features of the three categories of movements considered in this study were found to be clearly different. This, together with previous observations on the differential effects of dopamine agonists on <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> different intervals, suggests that <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> intervals of 90  s are regulated by neurotransmitter mechanisms different from those modulating <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> an interval of 10 - 90  s...|$|R

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|After the war Morshead {{returned}} to civilian life, becoming the Orient Steam Navigation Company's Australian general manager on 31 December 1947. He continued to receive honours for his military service, including a further mention in despatches in 1947 and the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He {{was president of}} the Bank of New South Wales, the chairman of David Jones, and director of several companies. From 1950 Morshead headed 'The Association', a secret organization similar to the New Guard <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> which he had been involved in the mid-1920s, and which was prepared to oppose communist attempts at subversion. It was quietly disbanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Endtroducing..... {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who praised DJ Shadow's {{approach to}} sampling and the beats he created from samples. It ranked highly on various year-end {{lists of the}} best albums of 1996. The album {{is considered to be}} a landmark work in the instrumental hip hop <b>movement,</b> <b>with</b> DJ Shadow's innovative sampling techniques and arrangements influencing other producers to create similar sample-based works. Endtroducing..... has since appeared in several publications' lists of the decade's greatest albums.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate <b>movement,</b> <b>with</b> myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with Mud Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King in Mud Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E

5|$|However, {{while he}} cares {{for the welfare}} of the people and of his family, Vayne is willing to use any means {{necessary}} to maintain order and retain power. He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E
5|$|I had viewed Hitler and his <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> some skepticism, {{but when}} the {{abolition}} of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees.

It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E

5|$|The Italian commander, Admiral Angelo Iachino, {{intended}} {{to carry out}} a surprise attack on the British Cruiser Squadron in the area (commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell), executing a pincer <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> the battleship Vittorio Veneto. Cunningham though, was aware of Italian naval activity through intercepts of Italian Enigma messages. Although Italian intentions were unclear, Cunningham's staff believed an attack upon British troop convoys was likely and orders were issued to spoil the enemy plan and, if possible, intercept their fleet. Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a game of golf and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul). After sunset, he boarded HMS Warspite and left Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began on}} 12 February. San Martín {{organized}} a pincer <b>movement,</b> <b>with</b> Soler leading the west column and O'Higgins the east one. O'Higgins, eager to avenge the defeat at Rancagua, {{rushed to the}} attack, instead of coordinating with Soler. This gave the royalists a brief advantage. San Martín instructed Soler to rush the attack as well. The combined attack was successful and San Martín's column secured the final victory. The battle ended with 600 royalists dead and 500 prisoners, with only 12 deaths and 120 injuries in the Army of the Andes.|$|E
