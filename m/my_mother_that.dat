2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I could be a star." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When men get excited, {{and their}} passions are once inflamed, {{they will do}} much, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>that</b> they might not dream of, else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps Ruth {{had gone}} to tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> Mysa was lost," [...] Chebron {{suggested}} when Jethro had gone so far in his story.|$|E

6000|$|... ("The {{truth is}} one {{ought to have}} been taught French. Now, I suppose, old Barfoot is talking to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>That's</b> an odd affair to be sure. But I can't see Bonamy down there. Damn London!") for the market carts were lumbering down the street.|$|R
60|$|If <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{suspected}} <b>that</b> I was anticipating marriage, {{and said}} nothing, Nancy Durrett suspected and spoke out.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are found}} out," [...] she said, [...] "I {{will take the}} blame upon myself, and tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> you were acting solely at my request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I {{suffer for}} nothing save the {{opportunity}} to see her. She knows full well what other words I would speak if she were here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mistake, I think," [...] said he. [...] "'Tis {{respect for}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> inspires me." [...] And his green eyes flashed upon the painted hag. She rose {{up a very}} fury.|$|E
60|$|And at this {{there came}} a light into <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> face <b>that</b> never {{altogether}} left it until the end.|$|R
50|$|It's Not <b>My</b> <b>Mothers</b> Fault <b>That</b> I Was Born With Albinism: Some {{would have}} you believe <b>that</b> it's <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> fault <b>that</b> I was born with albinism. In most cases, our mothers are {{abandoned}} by our fathers after giving birth to us, saying it is her fault, that she had an affair with a white man or the ghost of a European. In truth, both <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>my</b> father must carry the albinism gene in order for me to be born with albinism.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. I want no one to-night, no one; {{after that}} you'll look after <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>that's</b> the great thing." [...] He spoke steadily, but his hand trembled {{so that he}} could not light his candle, and Julius was obliged to do it, saying wistfully, [...] "I'll come up the {{first thing in the morning}} and see how you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I {{was going}} to have you to breakfast with me; and I believe she was well {{satisfied}} that I should, for a time, be out of her way." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the woman}} who came along the path was of tall and majestic figure, which should have shown <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I had {{contrived}} to start my train without her this time. But it did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reginald Lind told <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> the {{discovery}} {{was made by}} accident after the marriage, {{and that they were}} all shocked by it. It was he who said that it was Conolly's cousin that you were with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean I can {{not marry}} unless I marry one of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> race. <b>That</b> is <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> wish, {{and the will}} of her relations. You are an American, not of Spanish blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it is unbearable--unbearable for <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and for me, {{and for us}} all. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> thinks <b>that</b> {{some terrible}} thing has {{happened}} to the property; but if so, why should I not be told?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And whither am I to go?" [...] I cried, remembering <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>that</b> Mondolfo--the {{only place}} of safety--was closed {{to me by}} her cruelly pious hands.|$|R
60|$|Amy {{had come}} to us merely as a stop gap, {{explaining}} to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> {{she was about to}} be married and desired only a temporary engagement to bridge over the few weeks between then and the ceremony.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because an English heer is with me," [...] cried Rachel. [...] "Go {{and look}} for his horse and bring a rope, then wait till the mist rises. Also send to tell the pastor and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I am safe." ...|$|E
60|$|I told <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I {{had done}} nothing, {{absolutely}} nothing, but {{attend to the}} wants of my son's people, just as I {{had been used to}} see my grandmother, and my aunt Thistlewood, or any English lady, do at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether would ye {{like to go}} to Pine Point {{settlement}} and stay with <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> or <b>that</b> I should come here and spend the winter with you and Dick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is my--no--his father's kinsman, madam, and {{is known}} to be but a plotter. Oh, surely, he is not in your secrets, madam, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> after <b>that</b> day at Tutbury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{the apron}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> uses, <b>that</b> bit of silk {{will soon be}} spoilt, for the flowers are wet," [...] and David gravely offered her a large checked pinafore.|$|R
6000|$|I tried; {{and this}} time I succeeded. With the image of Mrs. Van Brandt vividly present to my mind, I {{arranged}} the first words of the sentence which was to tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> my [...] "infatuation" [...] was at an end! ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not again}} see <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> day, {{nor did she}} sup with us that evening. I was told by Fra Gervasio that on my account was she in retreat, praying for light and {{guidance}} in the thing that must be determined concerning me.|$|E
60|$|Silas was not greatly {{surprised}} at seeing us. During the day while Hiram and I lay in hiding on Noddle island, {{he had gone}} to my home in search of me, and there learned from <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> I had set out for Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} said so, Nan,' he answered. 'I have simply said I {{was sorry to}} have {{offended}} <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and <b>that</b> is true; I could not sleep under her displeasure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{making a}} pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James, for before I was born <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> vowed <b>that</b> I should go forth with a thank {{offering}} on my eighteenth birthday.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So I thought then, Zinita," [...] he answered; [...] "now I know otherwise. Nada is {{daughter}} to Mopo yonder indeed, {{but he is}} no father to me, though he has been named so, nor {{was the mother of}} Nada <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>That</b> is so, Councillors." ...|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA (peremptorily at Valentine). Get up. (Valentine gets up abjectly.) Now {{let us have}} no false delicacy. Tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> we {{have agreed}} to marry one another. (A silence of stupefaction ensues. Valentine, dumb with panic, looks at them with an obvious impulse to run away.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course no {{one could}} {{convince}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>that</b> her son's [...] "attractions" [...] might not prove sufficiently strong to make his [...] "prospect" [...] a possibility, for to her I {{was not only a}} distinguished author, but a [...] "Good provider," [...] something which outweighed literary attainment in a home like ours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "for if {{my father}} and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> knew <b>that</b> I did such a thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} awfully {{troublesome}} to you, coming over all this way, I am sure. Indeed, money could {{not pay for}} it; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> feels <b>that.</b> It must cut up your time so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Fanny, why did {{you answer}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in <b>that</b> way?" [...] said Lady Meredith. [...] "You {{saw that she was}} vexed, She had other things to vex her besides this about Mr. Robarts." ...|$|R
