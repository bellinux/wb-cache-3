5000|$|Brown's {{research}} {{showed that}} manganese causes the protein to change conformation, {{similar to that}} seen in prion diseases such as BSE. [...] Additionally, his research also showed that animals with BSE and humans with vCJD had elevated levels of manganese in their brains, and that prion protein extracted from their brains retained some of this <b>manganese.</b> <b>Brown</b> agreed with Purdey only in {{as far as the}} potential for manganese to be a risk factor, increasing the likelihood that BSE or another prion disease would occur. Brown supported Purdey in his quest to investigate the potential role of manganese in prion disease and this led to the filming of a program for the BBC in which both Brown and Purdey appeared. While Purdey pursued the notion that environmental manganese was a cause of BSE (something that arguably could never be proven), Brown suggested that a chelation therapy to remove the excess manganese from patients with vCJD could be of benefit. While Brown's more conventional research was very well funded, suchchelation therapy for prion disease was never funded despite support for the idea from a number of sources including Charles, Prince of Wales.|$|E

In the present process fine crystalline powders of doped boehmite, a-alumina or their mixtures from commercial aluminium metal stock in a single step are obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. The boehmite, a alumina oe their mixture in doped forms are obtained by taking dopants like chromium(for ruby or pink alumina), <b>manganese</b> (<b>brown</b> alumina), magnesium (for spinel) {{in the form of}} water soluble salt or aluminium alloys containing the dopant (Al-Mg alloys) along with initial reactants and conducting hydrothermal reaction...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation of 14 medieval stained-glass panels from the Grodziec Collection. The main objective was to investigate the origin, dating, history and previous conservation treatments of the panels. The investigation of glass composition and corrosion products was carried out by means of scanning macro X-ray fluorescence and portable XRF spectrometers. The study revealed that some glasses have a composition characteristic of medieval potash-lime-silicate glass while other pieces could be classified as sodium glass. Surprisingly, the original paint layer of Grodziec panels contained two different types of contour paint. Additionally, corrosion products, such as gypsum, or dark areas caused by <b>manganese</b> <b>browning,</b> were observed. The results were completed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination, which permitted the authors to observe multi-layered glasses and their corrosion phenomena with spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we will show the {{differences}} in the technology of production of the manganese decorated glazes from early black and green Caliphal pottery (10 – 11 th century AD) from Murcia; green and brown Hispano–Moresque productions (13 – 14 th century AD) from Valencia and Catalonia; and <b>manganese</b> <b>brown</b> decorations (17 th century AD) from Barcelona. SEM–EDX and μ-X-ray diffraction performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) have been carried out on polished thin cross sections (about 50 μm thick) of the decorated glazes. Braunite, kentrolite, bustamite and hausmannite have been identified in the brown decorations. Differences and similarities in the nature and microstructure are presented and related to differences in the production process...|$|E
40|$|The {{compounds}} {{responsible for}} the colours and decorations in glass and glazed ceramics include: colouring agents (transition metal ions), pigments (micro-and nano-precipitates of compounds that either do not dissolve or recrystallize in the glassy matrix) and opacifiers (microcrystalline compounds with high light scattering capability). Their composition, structure and range of stability are highly dependent {{not only on the}} composition but also on the procedures followed to obtain them. Chemical composition of the colorants and crystallites may be obtained by means of SEM-EDX and WDX. Synchrotron Radiation micro-X-ray Diffraction has a small beam size adequate (10 to 50 microns footprint size) to obtain the structural information of crystalline compounds and high brilliance, optimal for determining the crystallites even when present in low amounts. In addition, in glass decorations the crystallites often appear forming thin layers (from 10 to 100 micrometers thick) and they show a depth dependent composition and crystal structure. Their nature and distribution across the glass/glazes decorations gives direct information on the technology of production and stability and {{may be related to the}} color and appearance. A selection of glass and glaze coloring agents and decorations are studied by means of SR-micro- XRD and SEM-EDX including: <b>manganese</b> <b>brown,</b> antimony yellow, red copper lusters and cobalt blue. The selection includes Medieval (Islamic, and Hispano Moresque) and renaissance tin glazed ceramics from the 10 th to the 17 th century AD...|$|E
40|$|Britton {{collaborated with}} Norwegian artist Marit Tingleff in this duo, {{to extend the}} {{dialogue}} between their ceramic works, continuing an international rapport. In 2007 Tingleff and Britton {{were part of a}} much larger exhibition END, which had ben coordinated over some years between 7 British and Scandinavian artists. It was shown first in Copenhagen at the Kunstindustrimuseet and then at Bomuldsfabriken Kunsthall, Arendal,Norway. For Unforeseen Events, working out of sight of each other’s researches (hence the title) both were engaged with material risks in making fresh discoveries in form and surface, and an investigation of the breadth of expression achievable with a limited palette of pigment and glaze. Allusions to tableware were common to both, beyond the context of function. Tingleff’s six huge rectangular plates, e. g. 170 x 92 cm, painted with slips and glaze, were wall mounted on shelves. Britton’s fifteen pieces were smaller in scale and greater in formal variety, occupying two expansive tables/plinths. The significance and innovation of this series of pots in the commitment she shows to stretching the idea of the container, was rooted in the following: Ongoing glaze experiments, fluidity, transparency, altering slips underneath. Green and yellow key colours, also a new <b>manganese</b> <b>brown</b> used with yellow, and kinds of white. New variations of formal types: jug, jar,plate, also a channeling double pot form, changed by a cone-section base. Jugs flaring and tapering, forms made by a newly defined curving slab process Plates as platforms, straight-sided ovals, deep hollows; oblong plates with oval centre fields, and exaggerated relief ornaments eg Squirl Scaling up as skill grows with new means of glazing initiated in 2007. A gallery essay by Edmund de Waal was also available online. Reviewed in Ceramic Review, issue 241,Jan/Feb 2010, later published in Norwegian. Pieces from both Britton and Tingleff from Unforeseen Events were illustrated in De Waal’s The Pot Book, Phaidon, 2011...|$|E

50|$|Kutnohorite may be white, {{pale pink}} or light brown. The pink shades {{are due to}} {{increased}} <b>manganese</b> and the <b>brown</b> colours are due to increased iron content. The mineral is translucent with a white to pale pink streak and vitreous to dull luster. It is uniaxial (-) with refractive indices No = 1.710 to 1.727 and Ne = 1.519 to 1.535, similar to dolomite. The ordinary refractive index, No, is high, comparable with spinel (1.719).|$|R
50|$|Black Sea Lowland almost {{completely}} within the south oblast, covering {{half of its}} territory. In Ternivka located meteorite crater. It is 11 km in diameter and the age {{is estimated to be}} 280 ± 10 million years (Permian). The crater is not exposed at the surface. The Dnieper Upland contains a number of minerals including iron, <b>manganese,</b> granite, graphite, <b>brown</b> coal, kaolin etc. Kryvbas is an important economic region, specializing in iron ore mining and the steel industry. It is arguably the main iron ore region of Eastern Europe. Named after the city of Kryvyi Rih, the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk, as well as a small neighbouring part of the Kirovohrad Oblast.|$|R
50|$|The white opaque surface makes {{tin glaze}} a good base for painted {{decoration}}. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly cobalt oxide for blue, copper oxide for green, iron oxide for <b>brown,</b> <b>manganese</b> dioxide for purple-brown and antimony for yellow. Late Italian maiolica blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called istoriato. To these oxides modern potters {{are able to}} add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes fritted. In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were {{not strong enough to}} penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.|$|R
40|$|Pleurotus pulmonarius is {{a species}} of the oyster {{mushroom}} which has become the second most popularly cultivated mushroom in the world. In this study, we show that renewed fruiting from excised stipes {{can be used as}} a simple and rapid in vitro bioassay system to detect fruiting modulators. We used this and conventional cultivation techniques to examine the effects of cadmium, a potential contaminant from industrial sources, calcium, which is an ingredient in mushroom compost, and manganese, which has been claimed to improve the yield of P. ostreatus. All the three metallic salts did not affect sporulation. Calcium chloride addition shortened the time taken for the mushroom to fully cover the cultivation compost and improved yield. Insoluble calcium salts at higher concentrations had a similar though less pronounced effect. The calcium and total amino acid contents of fruit bodies also increased. Compost supplementation with calcium is desirable for cultivation of the oyster mushroom but not indispensable since the straw-based cultivation substrate is itself able to provide the required minerals. By contrast, manganese chloride retarded mycelial growth and decreased yield but increased the total amino acid content in the stipe whilst manganese sulphate did not enhance accumulation of manganese into fruit bodies. Excess <b>manganese</b> induced <b>browning</b> of vegetative tissues. Cadmium ions did not kill the oyster mushroom at 4 ± 5 mm but reduced yield by 50 %. At this concentration cadmium decreased the total amino acid content and affected the amino acid profile but did not affect the form and shape of the fruit bodies. Pleurotus pulmonarius concentrated cadmium to such an extent that consumption of as little as 20 g (d. w.) of the most contaminated samples would exceed the weekly limit tolerated by humans and thus pose a health hazard. Monitoring the heavy metal contents of mushrooms marketed for food is, therefore, advise...|$|R
30|$|Raman spectra {{recorded}} on brown painted areas were rather weak in intensity {{and failed to}} provide any reliable information concerning pigments. However, strong emissions from both manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) were detected by LIBS in the brown paint (Fig.  10 b), and this {{could be interpreted as}} evidence of a mixture of <b>manganese</b> black or <b>brown</b> pigment with red iron oxide. Likewise the detection of chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) in the yellow painted parts of the door frame was critical in obtaining strong evidence for the use of chromium yellow (PbCrO 4) possibly in mixture with yellow ochre (hydrous ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O) as it can be suggested based on the detection of Fe at the same spot. Detection of significant amounts of barium (Ba) by LIBS in the red, brown, light blue and yellow paint domains suggests the presence of barium sulphate, and this was further confirmed on the basis of Raman spectra collected in the yellow painted areas. The dominant presence of zinc (Zn) may be translated as an evidence for the presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) possibly used as an extender in the paint. However the simultaneous presence of barium and zinc might indicate the presence of lithopone, ZnS·BaSO 4. The presence of titanium (Ti), in very low concentration, in the blue and brown areas, but in higher concentration in the red and yellow paint, could be ascribed to impurities present in earth pigments and matrix minerals [39] or to titanium white (TiO 2) probably coming from later painting interventions known to have taken place at the church {{in the beginning of the}} twentieth century CE. Unfortunately, no additional documentation concerning these intervention was found. It is noted, that the presence of TiO 2 was not confirmed by Raman analysis. Aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) were also detected all across the door frame, most likely originating from matrix minerals, while the presence of strontium (Sr) relates to the presence of calcium carbonate.|$|R
