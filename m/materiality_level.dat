40|$|Materiality is a {{fundamental}} auditing concept. The determination and application of materiality {{in the conduct of}} an external audit is regulated by International Standards on Auditing. This paper analysed the benefits and drawbacks of materiality disclosures in Maltese statutory auditing from the perspective of Maltese auditors, whilst measuring and explaining their resistance to such disclosures. A mixed-methods research design was adopted whereby data was collected from Maltese auditors first using a selfadministered questionnaire, followed by semi-structured interviews. This paper concluded that the drawbacks of disclosing materiality in Maltese statutory audit reports greatly outweighed any potential benefits that might be reaped. Maltese auditors generally resisted disclosing <b>materiality</b> <b>levels</b> mainly due to the drawbacks associated with such disclosures. This paper also concluded that materiality disclosures in the audit report should, at present, be avoided in Malta because the local market is not sufficiently mature and knowledgeable to properly understand such disclosures. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{evidence}} concerning the effective use of qualitative materiality factors (QMF) included in the new ISA 450, and its potential consequences from the perspective of Spanish independent auditors and preparers of financial statements. Design/methodology/approach – A specially designed questionnaire was distributed to a sample of both (352) auditors and (121) preparers in Spain. Frequencies and ranking comparisons, Student's t-tests, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyse the data. Findings – Results show that the majority of auditors and preparers that participated in the study agree on the issuance of qualified audit reports when the financial statements contain uncorrected misstatements that are below the <b>materiality</b> <b>levels</b> but are related to QMF included in ISA 450. Furthermore, both groups accept that this situation would have important positive effects on the development and results of current practice in auditing, on the quality of financial statements, and on both users and society. Research limitations/implications – First, as with all mail surveys, there are some limitations associated with individuals' responses. Second, the findings of this paper should be interpreted bearing in mind that the survey was conducted before the new ISA 450 was published in October 2008. Finally, this paper is limited to the Spanish context; thus, the findings may not be applicable elsewhere. Practical implications – The findings of this paper have significant practical implications for auditors, as well as for policy makers, enabling them to better understand the importance of the qualitative side of materiality in auditing judgments. Originality/value – From the perspective of both auditors and preparers, this paper provides evidence about the QMF included in the new ISA 450, effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2009.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} dynamic fabric of experienced space in acousmatic music. The topology of spatial texture is {{a network of}} concepts treating music as a flexible, textural space, which deforms, shapes, and transforms in time. A comprehensive terminology is introduced, along with five fixed-media electroacoustic compositions, which exemplify a manifestation of spatial texture in composition and musical thinking. The theory draws from research on the cross-modality of texture perception, philosophical discourse on embodied meaning, physics, psychology of visual art, and discourse on space in acousmatic music. Several different structural perspectives are discussed, which reveal how spatial texture incorporates lower sound-structural <b>levels,</b> <b>materiality,</b> states and processes, motion, global networks and terrains, and relationships between space and time. Emphasis is put on visual and physical connections with spatiality in the acousmatic experience: cogency in spatial structure and dynamics reinforces links among modalities. The concepts and terminology are intended as a contribution to theory in the acousmatic medium, relevant to composition, analysis, and listening. The music represents an aesthetic orientation which emphasises materiality and morphology in texture, transformative processes, spatial design, and spatiotemporal polyvalence.

Against this backdrop, this introductory essay frames the complex materialities and in/visibilities of code. We argue that code, in its semiotic and technical senses alike, both enables and obscures - in fact, it conveys often through forms of masking and erasure. We thus position code as a negative-yet-generative force, through a study of the politics and aesthetics of redaction. Code emerges as an analytical figure able to diagram forms of connection and tessellation, but also negation and erasure, within material, technological and cultural assemblages...|$|R

Tidigare studier har funnit flertalet bakomliggande faktorer som påverkar denna bedömning. 2011 implementerades ISA i Sverige varför det finns ett intresse att undersöka vad denna standard har haft för påverkan på svenska revisorers väsentlighetsbedömning.   Studiens resultat visar att tre faktorer av de som ingår i studien kan förklara variationen i revisorers väsentlighetsbedömningar. Variablerna kön, chefspress och storlek på revisionsbyrå har i studien ett signifikant samband med variationen i bedömd väsentlighetsnivå. Att dessa olika faktorer har en påverkan på väsentlighetsbedömningen antas förklaras av bland annat olika nivåer av riskbenägenhet och revisionskvalitet.

40|$|The {{financial}} statements represent a comprehensive and standardized document including financial {{information about the}} company. The companies need to publish this document in the Collection of Deeds, and since the documents are submitted to the Collection of Deeds in electronic form and are subsequently freely available, any {{financial statements}} are generally available {{to a wide range}} of potential users. Users of the financial statements can be divided based on their relation to the financial statements and based on level of their knowledge of accounting. The confidence of users in information disclosed in the financial statements is higher, in case the financial statements were subject to audit. The user of the financial statements does not have a possibility of detailed verification of the information presented in it (he cannot inquire the management of the company, inspect the original accounting documents, etc.). In this case, the audit represents ensuring correctness of the information presented in the financial statements and also assurance that the financial statements were subject to the independent verification. These facts enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements and this is also the purpose of an audit as defined by the International Standards on Auditing. In accordance with the International Standards on Auditing the auditor expects that the user of the financial statements has reasonable knowledge of accounting and is willing to study the financial statements with reasonable effort. Auditor performs his testing based on certain <b>materiality</b> <b>level</b> that does not have to agree to the <b>materiality</b> <b>level</b> of the user. The risk represents in this case the situation, when the <b>materiality</b> <b>level</b> of the user is lower than the <b>materiality</b> <b>level</b> determined by the auditor. The user of the financial statements has limited possibilities to verify the information in it, however, he is able to verify the link among information presented in different parts of the financial statements and confront the financial statements with other relevant information available. My dissertation consists from theoretical and practical part. In the theoretical part, there are possible verifications described that can be performed by the user of the financial statements and in the practical part, there are the mentioned procedures applied to financial statements of four domestic companies. The subject of my research was financial statements for the years 2006 to 2009. The aim was not only the identification of the risks in the financial statements from the users' point of view, but also monitoring of the development of financial statements in time. The subject of the dissertation was also the verification of the formal correctness of audit reports issued to the selected financial statements (I am registered as Czech statutory auditor by the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic and therefore I am able to perform this verification). The subject of the dissertation was not the verification of the factual correctness of the audit report, this verification is in principle not possible without possibility to look into the audit file. During analysis of selected financial statements I have identified several areas that represent risk of misstatement in the financial statements from the users' point of view. It related mainly to going concern issues, issues relating to completeness of reserves and provisions and risk of possible overvaluation of finance investments and related receivables to subsidiaries. The user of the financial statements should for his better understanding therefore look for other information relating to the company from freely available resources and perform comparison with financial statements of other companies in the same industry. The risks mentioned above were not sufficiently commented in the notes to the financial statements and that subsequently gives a rise to questions on financial statements users' side and lowers his confidence in information presented in the financial statements. I think that there is a change in the audit approach necessary, it should not be enough just that the financial statements are free from material misstatement; the financial statements should not give a rise to additional questions from their users...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{distinguish}} between aggressive earnings management (aggressive accounting) and financial reporting fraud (fraud) is an essential characteristic for auditors in fulfilling their responsibilities. Yet little is known of how auditors make this distinction in practice. Perhaps due to the ambiguity in defining where aggressive accounting ends and fraud begins, few studies have attempted to investigate {{the distinction between the}} two types of financial manipulation. This current research provides evidence as to how auditors distinguish between aggressive accounting and fraud in practice. Specifically, this study examines which factors auditors invoke in determining whether an identified financial manipulation constitutes aggressive accounting or fraudulent accounting. Findings from interviews with senior auditors suggest these factors include managerial intent, compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, <b>materiality</b> <b>level,</b> and measurement subjectivity. Research findings have the potential to alleviate some of the ambiguity associated with distinguishing between aggressive and fraudulent accounting. As such, this study contributes to the earnings management, financial reporting fraud, and audit judgement research literatures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} an informed Design-to-Robotic-Production (D 2 RP) system for additive manufacturing to achieve performative porosity in architecture at various scales. An extended series of experiments on materiality, fabrication and robotics were designed and carried out resulting in the production of a one-to-one scale prototype. In this context, design materiality has been approached from both digital and physical perspectives. At digital <b>materiality</b> <b>level,</b> a customized computational design framework is implemented for form finding of compression only structures combined with a material distribution optimization method. Moreover, the chained connection between parametric design model and robotic production setup has led to a systematic study of certain aspects of physicality that cannot be fully simulated in the digital medium, which then establish a feedback loop for underrating material behaviors and properties. As a result, the D 2 RP system proposes an alternative method of robotic material deposition to create an informed material architectur...|$|E

40|$|Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 121 {{is a new}} {{standard}} devoted {{to the issue of}} impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment loss occurs when the carrying amount is not expected to be recovered. When SFAS 121 was issued, early adoption was suggested but not required for fiscal years beginning before December 15, 1995. Although there are some similarities, the standard sets some different rules for assets "to be held and used" and assets "to be disposed of" Since the standard does not identify a <b>materiality</b> <b>level,</b> it remains at the discretion of management. This paper first discusses the requirements of SFAS 121. Then a sample of companies is analyzed to determine compliance with the {{new standard}}. A sample of 25 companies was chosen from the CD-ROM Disclosure Software. The sample was analyzed and compared on a list of items to identify relationship between the items and to identify if, how and when companies plan to comply with SFAS 121. Some of the items noted were year ends, early adoption of SFAS 121, type of impairment, discussion in the management representation letter and discussion in the footnotes to the financial statements.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amounts obtained using professionally accepted quantitative benchmarks of audit planning materiality and the size of accounting misstatements corrected by financial statements restatements. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a sample of 136 companies (237 company years) that have restated such financial statements and compare the amounts of the restatements with planning materiality benchmarks (rules of thumb) established to aid auditors in arriving at audit planning levels. Findings – It was found that, depending on the method of analysis selected and the materiality benchmark followed, as high as approximately 62 per cent of the restatements involve income levels less than the planning <b>materiality</b> <b>level.</b> Research limitations/implications – The results lead to questions as to the appropriate relationship between the scope of audit procedures, which is in part determined by these quantitative materiality benchmarks, and subsequent financial statement restatements. Originality/value – The issue addressed in this study is important because if audit planning levels for materiality are in excess of the amounts subsequently restated due to accounting misstatements, this might serve as an explanation for a number of recent restatements. Furthermore, it might suggest the need to consider decreasing acceptable materiality planning levels, thus resulting in a recalibration of the audit process.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this article}} we study whether {{individual}} auditor characteristics (gender, experience and sector expertise) demonstrate associations with type of audit opinion. Methodology: We conduct multinomial regressions on a dataset of 468 Belgian nonprofit organizations (NPOs) using archival data from book year 2006. We control for potential self-selection bias. Findings: Female auditors {{are more likely to}} qualify the audit report than male auditors. Sector specialist auditors are more likely to issue an explanatory paragraph than non-specialists. These findings suggest that female auditors are more risk averse and conservative, which causes them to detect and report more errors. Sector specialists appear to be better able to detect uncertainties, more confident to report them and more concerned about their reputation. NPOs’ resource dependence is related to audit opinion as well. Originality: First, our research setting is fruitful as it is characterized by an audit client market that was new to most Belgian auditors in book year 2006, i. e. the first year of legally required external audit in Belgian NPOs. Consequently, auditors’ decisions (e. g. risk assessment, <b>materiality</b> <b>level)</b> are more likely influenced by personal characteristics than by a standard audit program. Second, auditing research in the nonprofit market is scarce, with determinants of audit opinions being unexplored until now. Third, sector expertise is measured at partner level instead of at audit firm/office level, in a setting (new client market) that logically implies large differences between sector and non-sector specialists. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Osteoporosis as {{a chronic}} disease, {{affecting}} especially women in postmenopausal age, is an important, {{social and economic}} health problem especially of women of today’s world. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the level of knowledge of women in the peri- and postmenopausal period about the prevention of osteoporosis and show the influence of chosen risk factors on the level of this knowledge. Material and methods : A group of 300 women aged 45 - 65, being patients of healthcare centres in Chełm, Lublin and Zamość (Lublin voivodeship, south-eastern Poland) were included in the study. The purposive sampling was used. Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (OKT) 2011 was the research tool. Gathered material was subjected to descriptive and statistical analysis. Tukey’s test, t-student test and variance analysis (ANOVA) were all applied. An accepted p <b>materiality</b> <b>level</b> was < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01. Results : Respondents presented the average level of knowledge about the role of physical activity in the prevention of osteoporosis (M = 13. 93) and a low level of knowledge about well-balanced diet rich in calcium (M = 9. 77). The knowledge about risk factors, screening and treatment remained on the average level (M = 8. 00). An influence of socio-demographic factors on the level of knowledge was shown. Also some behaviours, associated with the lifestyle indeed influenced the level of this knowledge. Conclusions : Professional educational programs on osteoporosis should be implemented in the population of Polish peri- and postmenopausal women...|$|E
