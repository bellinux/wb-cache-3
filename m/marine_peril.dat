40|$|Marine salvage, in principle, is {{a service}} {{rendered}} to assist or save a maritime property in <b>marine</b> <b>peril.</b> Today {{there are many}} improvements in maritime safety in the world. In parallel, decreasing number of marine accidents and the technological changes in ship designs as well as characteristics of cargo and increasing amount of dangerous goods being transported by ships started to cause the characteristics of demand for marine salvage services to change putting the marine salvage industry in operational and financial difficulties. Today, marine salvage is considered as a solution for preventing marine pollution caused by shipping accidents in the maritime industry. Emergency response and pollution prevention has become important elements of marine salvage services. Maritime nations are in continuously working on improving maritime safety for pollution prevention, as the maritime traffic is constantly increasing. Modern salvage approaches such as; government supported ERV (Emergency Response Vessel) systems are in practice in many maritime countries as a solution for pollution prevention as the marine salvage industry is facing an eradication in recent years, due to operational and financial stress caused by expenses of being ready to respond for modern salvage needs on stand by...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} should insureds expect {{compensation}} on interruption to their voyage by loss of possession or free use or disposal {{of their property}} where it remains undamaged? Marine insurance does not compensate for partial losses occasioned by delay. Recent authority (Masefield v Amlin Corporate Member) confirmed an insured could not recover for an actual total loss following capture where pirates would accept ransom then release the property. Property was not an actual total loss even after condemnation by a foreign tribunal (Panamanian Oriental Steamship Corporation v Wright), although condemnation might establish constructive total loss. Where the voyage becomes impossible by detention or embargo, the insured’s right to abandon to insurers for constructive total loss may be unpredictable (eg after one year’s duration in The Bamburi). In each scenario, insurers are excused making prompt payments, and from dealing themselves {{with the consequences of}} the peril. In each the insured is either uncompensated, or at best must wait. These authorities document an evolution; historically, English and American laws allowed the insured to abandon and recover for a total loss while these perils lasted, ignoring ongoing hopes of recovery. This thesis argues that a presumption of total loss still applies to all perils causing loss of possession. This appeared first in Continental treatises and was later applied in English law. No universal test of total loss applies equally to all <b>marine</b> <b>perils.</b> Instead, situations of loss of possession should be governed by peril-specific rules, including the presumption of total loss for perils causing loss of possession...|$|R
40|$|Causation is {{a crucial}} issue in ascertaining whether certain loss or damage is covered in an {{insurance}} policy. Although marine insurance is well-known for investigating the “proximate” cause of loss {{in order to determine}} the insurers’ liability, decisions by English courts are far from reconcilable. The problem has been suggested to be the inference of matters of fact, and consequently, causal connection is deemed as a complex and uncertain issue. In the light of incoherency and uncertainty of law in this respect, the value of this research lies in the effort to conceptualize and develop a set of consistent causation rules in the marine insurance context and to explore how perils themselves would affect the formation and application of causation rules. Essentially, the proximate cause in law should not remain as a mere open question of fact. In order to achieve the merits, this dissertation scrutinises the causation theory itself and also the correlations between the perils involved in the policy. Introduction presents the legal problem of causation in marine insurance law and stresses the importance of setting up coherent and certain rules. The research on the pure causation theory consists of two chapters: Chapter One regarding the test of causation, i. e. the doctrine of proximity; and Chapter Two on concurrent causes. The subsequent three chapters concentrate on identifying the cause of loss from the nature and concepts of different marine risks. Chapter Three introduces <b>marine</b> <b>perils</b> and examines how causation rules apply in the case of a few typical insured and uninsured perils; Chapter Four and Chapter Five are concerned with exclusive researches on inherent vice and seaworthiness respectively. Apart from the substantive analysis on causation, burden of proof is addressed in the last chapter. Finally, the Conclusion provides a summary of the issues and the set of causation rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to compare the rules on causation and incidence of loss from a hull insurance perspective in the Nordic countries. As a consequence of there being underlying differences in how these questions are resolved, it therefore results in an interesting comparison. In addition, {{in light of the}} proposal of a common Marine Insurance Plan for the entire Nordic market a comparison is relevant for the same reasons. In the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan the scope of the insurers liability when covered and uncovered perils have contributed to a loss is based on an apportionment principle, cf. § NMIP 2 - 13. This solution is unique in relation to the corresponding rules in the Nordic Countries, which operate with the dominant cause principle. However, the NMIP was used as a prototype to the revision of the Finnish Marine Hull Conditions (FHC) in the year of 2001. As a result, today the FHC has a corresponding rule of apportionment. Nevertheless, an exception is made to the apportionment principle when the loss is attributed to a combination of <b>marine</b> and war <b>perils.</b> In this case the starting point is the dominant cause principle as well. Another question related to causation arises in cases where a loss is caused by a peril that {{can be traced back to}} a previous insurance period. According to the NMIP § 2 - 11 first subparagraph the liability of the insurer is triggered when the interest insured is struck by an insured peril during the insurance period. The starting point is thus a peril has struck principle which is a different point of departure to the damage principle which the remaining Nordic countries operate with. The approach to the question of causation and incidences of loss differ within the Nordic countries. These differences may provide implications both in changing between the insurance conditions and with an implementation of a common Nordic Marine Insurance Plan. The question to be answered is what the differences really are, their impact and which solution would be best suited for the whole common Nordic marine insurance market. Although an all comprehensive comparison between the Nordic rules of marine insurance would be both interesting and relevant at time, the aim of this work will be limited to compare and analyse the selected sections from a hull insurance perspective. Focus is foremost put on a comparison between the relevant Swedish and Norwegian rules...|$|R
