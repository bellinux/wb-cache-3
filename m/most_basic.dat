Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as Ada, <b>most</b> <b>BASICs</b> (an exception being BBC BASIC), Fortran, SQL and Pascal. There are also languages, such as Haskell, Prolog and Go, {{in which the}} capitalization of an identifier encodes information about its semantics.|$|R

5|$|While {{agreeing on}} <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the {{accident}} investigation, arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes the accident was caused by mistakes made both by air traffic controllers and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed {{on a collision course}} by the air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), {{guarantees the}} right to life and {{the right to}} personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called {{the right to life}} the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E

If a problem is found it re-displays the line, highlighting the text near the error in inverse video. This can make catching syntax errors on the Atari much easier than on other editors; <b>most</b> <b>BASICs</b> will not display the errors until the program is executed.|$|R

5|$|Hopping or jumping is conceptually the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption {{sites on the}} surface lattice. Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites, the number of which depends {{on the nature of}} the surface lattice. Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process. Studies have shown the presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> form of {{language is a}} set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, {{and may be}} used to separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E

5|$|The lower-level {{buildings}} for Humans and Orcs {{have the same}} functions, but different sprites. The Town Hall stores resources and produces units that collect resources and construct buildings. Each Farm provides food for up to four units, and additional units cannot be produced until enough Farms are built. The Barracks produces all non-magical combat units, including melee, ranged, mounted, and siege units. However all except the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> also need assistance from other buildings, some of which can also upgrade units.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> known hydroxides.|$|E
