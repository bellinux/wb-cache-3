5|$|About 1 in 20 meteorites {{consist of}} the unique iron-nickel {{minerals}} taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200kg per capita. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in more-developed countries (7000–14000kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000kg per capita).|$|E

5|$|Like aluminium, copper is {{recyclable}} {{without any}} loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products. In volume, copper {{is the third}} most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35–55kg. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in more-developed countries (140–300kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E

Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament.

5|$|The {{existence}} of China {{was known to}} Roman cartographers, but their understanding of it was less certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD Geography separates the Land of Silk (Serica) {{at the end of}} the overland Silk Road from the land of the Qin (Sinae) reached by sea. The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the Great Gulf (Magnus Sinus) east of the Golden Peninsula (Aurea Chersonesus, Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower Mekong Delta. The Great Gulf served as a combined Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, as Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the Cambodian coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern Libya (Africa). <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> given as unknown lands, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.|$|E
