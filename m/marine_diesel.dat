40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} to enhance the speed control effect of <b>marine</b> <b>diesels.</b> However, <b>marine</b> <b>diesels</b> are typical complex objects; sometimes it is difficult to achieve the control goals of the diesel speed with traditional PID strategy due to its fixed control parameters under all working conditions. In order to improve the speed control effect of <b>marine</b> <b>diesels,</b> the intelligent fuzzy RBF-PID strategy, which is integrated by fuzzy, Radical Basis Function (RBF) network and PID strategies, is presented in the paper. Development of the fuzzy RBF-PID controller is discussed in detail. Finally, the validity of the fuzzy RBF-PID strategy for the speed control of <b>marine</b> <b>diesels</b> is verified by simulation results...|$|R

25|$|A marine {{steam engine}} is a steam engine {{that is used}} to power a ship or boat. This article deals mainly with marine steam engines of the {{reciprocating}} type, which were in use from the inception of the steamboat in the early 19th century to their last years of large-scale manufacture during World War II. Reciprocating steam engines were progressively replaced in marine applications during the 20th century by steam turbines and <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> engines.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline of}} the {{steamship}} began after the World War Two. Many had {{been lost in the}} war, and <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> engine had finally matured as an economical and viable alternative to steam power. The diesel engine has far better thermal efficiency than reciprocating steam engine, and was far easier to control. Diesel engine also requires far less supervision and maintenance than steam engine, and as an internal combustion engine it does not need boilers nor water supply, being therefore more space efficient.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cargo}} {{is carried on}} the main deck, the barges have {{considerable}} tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of heavy fuel oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> oil for the pusher's auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|E
25|$|The real {{purposes}} of the building presented as Beamish Waggon and Iron Works next to Rowley Station is as the Regional Museums Store, completed in 2002, which Beamish shares with Tyne and Wear Museums. This houses, amongst other things, a large <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> engine by William Doxford & Sons of Pallion, Sunderland (1977); and several boats including the Tyne wherry (a traditional local type of lighter) Elswick No. 2 (1930). The store is only open at selected times, and for special tours which can be arranged through the museum; however, a number of viewing windows have been provided for use at other times.|$|E
25|$|The Liberty {{ships were}} the last major {{steamship}} class equipped with reciprocating engine. The last Victory ships had already been equipped with <b>marine</b> <b>diesels,</b> and diesel engine superseded both steamers and windjammers soon after the World War Two. Most steamers were used up to their maximum economical life span, and no commercial ocean-going steamers with reciprocating engines have been built after the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Large {{reversible}} two-cycle <b>marine</b> <b>diesels</b> have {{a minimum}} of three to over ten cylinders. Freight diesel locomotives usually have around 12 to 20 cylinders due to space limitations, as larger cylinders take more space (volume) per kwh, due to the limit on average piston speed of less than 30 ft/sec on engines lasting more than 40,000 hours under full power.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the company {{shifted away from}} {{automobile}} engines and into other markets, including <b>marine</b> <b>diesels,</b> fire pumps, and forklift trucks. In 1946, the ET199 was announced, which the company claimed was the first British-produced forklift truck. The ET199 was designed to carry a 4000 lb load with a 24 in load centre, and with a 9 ft lift height.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, the Swedish navy {{commissioned}} three Gotland-class submarines. On the surface, these {{boats are}} propelled by <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> engines. However, when submerged, {{they use a}} Stirling-driven generator developed by Swedish shipbuilder Kockums to recharge batteries and provide electrical power for propulsion. A supply of liquid oxygen is carried to support burning of diesel fuel to power the engine. Stirling engines are also fitted to the Swedish Södermanland-class submarines, the Archer-class submarines in service in Singapore and, license-built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries for the Japanese Sōryū-class submarines. In a submarine application, the Stirling engine offers {{the advantage of being}} exceptionally quiet when running.|$|E
25|$|For {{electricity}} production the ships have four auxiliary generating sets, Wärtsilä-Vasa 624TS 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving 1,000 kVa Strömberg alternators. One {{of the four}} engines, each with a power output of 810kW at 750 rpm, can also be coupled to a radial compressor to serve the air bubbling system. A fifth engine of the same type is dedicated to drive a second compressor. Instead of heavy fuel oil the auxiliary generating sets run on <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> oil. There's also an emergency diesel generator of Soviet origin that has a power output of 100kW at 1,500 rpm.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} <b>marine</b> <b>diesel</b> power {{was at a}} {{relatively}} early stage of development, and RML considered it unable to increase the two ships' speed to the required level. Lord Essendon therefore recommended steam turbines, and two options for the drive system: either conventional reduction gearing, or the newer turbo-electric transmission that had been pioneered in the USA and successfully applied to US, UK and French ocean liners. Whichever transmission was chosen, the cost of re-engining Asturias and Alcantara was estimated at about £500,000. Lord Essendon also urged RML directors to order a third ship of similar speed to share the route with Asturias and Alcantara.|$|E

50|$|In 1940 the British began buying Macks; {{when the}} US entered the war all {{production}} was for US and Allied militaries. In addition to commercial models Mack also {{designed and built}} {{a large number of}} tactical trucks. Because of their proprietary, rather than common standard, design, many were exported to US allies. Tank transmissions and <b>marine</b> <b>diesels</b> were also manufactured. By {{the end of the war}} Mack had supplied over 32,000 trucks and other components worth over $3,000,000.|$|R

While Queen Mary 2 is the first passenger ship to feature IEP propulsion, the first major passenger vessel to be powered by gas turbines was the Finnish ferry GTS Finnjet in 1977.|$|E
