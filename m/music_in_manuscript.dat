40|$|Ask for a {{definition}} of the musical term “obligato”; receive a different answer from everyone asked. What truth this axiom possesses lies in the multiple meanings acquired by the word during the past four hundred years. The varied definitions that presently circulate—an obligatory musical line, a virtuosic one, a filigree or descant, {{the use of a}} specific instrument, the use of organ pedal, the interaction of solo instrument and voice—all convey this complex legacy. Through analyses of <b>music</b> <b>in</b> <b>manuscript,</b> printed scores, and publishing materials, this dissertation concludes that certain meanings of “obligato” are active at different points in the history of Western musicking. Meanings activated by different instruments and in different genres can indicate the places of those instruments within an expected hierarchy, and can create those genres. ^ This dissertation begins by considering certain in consistencies in the use of obligato terminology: situating scholarly discussion {{of the power of the}} obbligato violin in “Erbarme dich” alongside Sebastian Bach’s own use of the term. Similarly, Guido Adler’s construction of obligate Akkompagnement as a fundamental compositional principle for the Wiener klassische Schule is analyzed alongside his source for the term: a letter of Beethoven, written to a publisher, planning the appearance of the Septet op. 20. The overview undertaken in this section, of the complex publication history of the Septet, leads to a consideration of changing practices and expectations concerning music in print and manuscript. An analysis of obligato terminology at work in Breitkopf music catalogues locates one source of obligato’s multiple meanings: in the collision of the trio and accompanied sonata genres. ^ Aspects of a voice and an instrument interacting often surface in connection with “obbligato. ” This dissertation’s conclusion takes a wide-ranging approach to this phenomenon: analyzing musicologists’s conceptualizing the heard experience of certain arias, musical expectations and structures as embedded in concert practices, and discourses of the supernatural. Thus, a final point of consideration is Rousseau’s récitatif obligé: focusing not as much on the people playing the instruments, as on the instruments themselves replying to—and leading—those who sing. ...|$|E

50|$|Librettists have {{historically}} received less prominent credit than the composer. In some 17th-century operas still being performed, {{the name of}} the librettist was not even recorded.

Realising that a production of the play with his music {{was going to be}} difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to mount, he also arranged the music into a concert suite of eight movements, the Turandot Suite. [...] Some of the <b>music</b> <b>in</b> the <b>manuscripts</b> is also designed for melodramas to be used with the play: each of the three riddles is preceded by enigmatic brass chords; initially Kalaf's replies were meant to be sung, although Busoni eventually dropped this idea.|$|R
50|$|Most of Frye's <b>music</b> survives <b>in</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{from the}} continent, which has {{suggested}} to scholars {{that he spent}} much of his time there; however stylistically his music is closer to that of other English composers (such as John Dunstaple and John Hothby) than to that of the Burgundian School, the most notable contemporary movement on the continent. A reason sometimes given for the survival of his <b>music</b> <b>in</b> continental sources is that the few remaining English 15th-century manuscripts rarely mention the names of composers; therefore there may be a good deal of his music which is simply anonymous. Survival of music from the period in England is sparse because most of it was destroyed during the ransacking of the monasteries carried out between 1536 and 1540 by Henry VIII.|$|R

50|$|The Haridasas {{played a}} crucial role in the growth of Carnatic music, {{influencing}} the composers of Andhra and Tamil Nadu. Tyagaraja’s biography acknowledges the influence of Purandaradasa; this influence is clear in the theme and treatment of several of Tyagaraja's compositions. Tulaja, the Maharashtra Ruler of Tanjore (1729-1735 AD), deals extensively in his Sangitasaramrita with the various musical forms of the Haridasas. He heaps praise on Vyasaraya and Purandaradasa as great composers and trendsetters <b>in</b> <b>music.</b> Numerous <b>manuscripts</b> <b>in</b> Tamil Nadu testify to the great popularity of Haridasa compositions as early as the 18th century. Purandaradasa, in fact was hailed as the father of Karnataka <b>music,</b> first <b>in</b> Tamil Nadu and then in the rest of the country. Though their compositions were imbued with the elements of Carnatic music and composed specifically in that tradition, their compositions have also made their way into the Hindustani music world, thanks mainly to eminent exponents of Hindustani music from northern Karnataka.|$|R

She was taught by Francesco Cavalli (who also taught Barbara Strozzi) by 1654 and wrote in all the major genres of the time, including opera, secular and sacred cantatas, and petit and grand motets. Her work is a combination of French and Italian styles. She uses the virtuosic elements of Italian style of the period, as well as French dance forms. Much of her work is for soprano voice with continuo accompaniment. She wrote an opera called L'Ercole amante (1707), to a libretto by Francesco Buti.|$|R
40|$|When a {{group of}} Ursuline nuns arrived in New Orleans from Rouen in 1727 it {{significantly}} changed the sacred musical landscape in the Louisiana Territory of New France. The women brought with them their commitment to education, a tradition of using <b>music</b> <b>in</b> their worship, and music similar to that performed in the Chapelle Royale of Louis XIV. Before 1727 the practice of sacred <b>music</b> <b>in</b> New Orleans was practical and simple, established by Capuchin priests in 1725 {{with the construction of}} a school and a makeshift church. The construction of the Ursulines' own permanent building in 1734 allowed the nuns to further emphasize their commitment to education through music. After the Ursulines arrived in New Orleans, the first French settlers were from wealthy and noble families that had a need and yearning for homeland familiarity and culture. In 1730 the Ursulines solidified their educational mission in New Orleans by establishing a lay confraternity with {{a group of}} French women colonists that secured a bridge of continuity between the nuns, the religious culture of France, {{and the members of the}} colony. In 1754 the sisters were given a manuscript entitled Nouvelles Poésies spirituelles et morales, copied in Paris in 1736. Now known as the Ursuline Manuscript, the collection contains music by composers active in the reign of Louis XIV. It is not known if the manuscript was prepared specifically for the nuns, but by examining the <b>music</b> <b>in</b> this <b>manuscript</b> [...] which contains well-known instrumental works turned into sacred vocal parodies [...] I will demonstrate that regardless of the copyist's intention, the <b>music</b> <b>in</b> the <b>manuscript</b> filled a need for such a document given the physical and cultural landscape in which the collection found itself. I will also discuss the importance of the manuscript and its place in the study of <b>music</b> history <b>in</b> North America, including a comparison between French and other European musical practices that were maintained in the New World in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries...|$|R

Before the advent of music printing {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century, such distribution is rare, and generally shows the popularity of a piece. This song, included in the Mellon Chansonnier, is the only one securely attributed to Adrien Basin: his others, ascribed simply to 'Basin' in their sources, may have been written by his brother.|$|R
