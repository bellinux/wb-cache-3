40|$|The LHC collimators {{have very}} {{complicated}} mechanical designs including <b>movable</b> <b>jaws</b> made of higly resistive materials, ferrite materials, tiny RF contacts. Since the jaws are moved {{very close to}} the circulating beams their contribution in the overall LHC coupling impedance is dominant, with respect to other machine components. For these reasons accurate simulation of collimators' impedance becomes very important and challenging. Besides, several dedicated tests have been performed to verify correct simulations of lossy dispersive material properties, such as resistive wall and ferrites, benchmarking code results with analytical, semi-analytical and other numerical codes outcomes. Here we describe all the performed numerical tests and discuss the results of LHC collimators' impedances and wake fields calculations.

50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed <b>jaw</b> and one <b>movable</b> <b>jaw</b> (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering scroll chucks. They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R

The basic Saturn I holddown arm constrains the vehicle by clamping it between a fixed support and a <b>movable</b> <b>jaw.</b> The jaw is on a link pinned to rotate sufficiently to release the vehicle. There are three links in the jaw (restraining) system arranged so that with a small force provided by a pneumatic separator mechanism, the large loads of the vehicle can be restrained. Design details discussed are the link system, the separator, adjustments, and the energy absorber. The function of preloading is discussed. The secondary release system is described. Finally, the design differences between the Saturn I and the Saturn V arm are described...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) transmission from the first Hi-Art II tomotherapy machine installed at the Advanced Center for Treatment, Research, and Education in Cancer (ACTREC). The MLC transmission was measured with an A 1 SL ion chamber and the radiographic extended dose range (EDR 2) film in virtual water slabs at 1. 5 -cm depth with a source-to-surface distance of 85 cm. The MLC transmission was measured for 30 s with all leaves open and for 360 s with all leaves closed. The <b>movable</b> <b>jaws</b> were set to the calibration field size of 5 x 40 cm at isocenter. The MLC transmission was found to be 0. 3 &#x 0025; with the ion chamber and 0. 32 &#x 0025; with the film. Thus, the MLC transmission value was found well within the manufacturer tolerance of 0. 5 &#x 0025;.

40|$|Packaging of {{finished}} products in nylon bags either at rural or urban areas requires sealing process. Sealing process requires heat energy {{which can be}} generated by electricity or burning of biomass materials. Generally, rural electrification in Nigeria suffers backwardness while urban electrification is highly unreliable. This makes Nigeria economy unstable as failure directly affects production sectors. Since biofuel is cheap and are readily available, Hence the need {{to design and fabricate}} a sealing machine that can use biofuel (charcoal) as source of energy for its sealing operation. A charcoal fueled sealing machine was designed, fabricated and tested for nylon package sealing for rural use and places without regular supply of electricity. The machine consists of a heat pot made from mild steel sheet, supported by four mild steel angle iron stands. The major operating components for the sealing process are the upper fixed and lower <b>movable</b> <b>jaws.</b> The lower jaw operates through a foot pedal which opens the jaw when depressed and closed with the help of return springs when foot pressure is removed. The jaws can also accommodate nylons up to the length of 300 mm for sealing. The size of the heating rectangular chamber is (0. 09 x 0. 115 x 0. 05) m 3, contained 7. 02 Kg of charcoal, which liberated 82. 27 KJ of heat for sealing. When 24. 23 m 3 of air was allowed to flow into the heating chamber. The lower jaw is easily displaced with small foot force of 0. 028 KN on the operating pedal.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{physically}} based method to automatize the synthesis process of talking heads {{able to perform}} an-imation encoded in a MPEG- 4 FBA stream. Starting from an input triangle mesh, we build the corresponding anatomical face model using techniques already known in literature. The novelty of our method is in using these techniques with the MPEG- 4 FBA specification. The components of the anatomical model are a multi-layered soft tissue representing the facial skin, a muscle map and the underlying bony structure, including a <b>movable</b> <b>jaw.</b> Given a MPEG- 4 Facial Animation Parameter expressing a basic action of the face, we use the facial model to perform this action by contracting the proper muscle group and, eventually, moving the jaw.
