The use of laser and other pulsed light systems for phototherapy and other <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfections</b> are based on spectral characteristics and configuration of the light source used. Here we explore the extent to which two pulsed laser parameters (wavelength and pulse frequency) affect deactivation of two pathogenic bacteria; Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Three pulsed laser wavelengths, 1064 nm and its 2 nd and 3 rd harmonics, were used to irradiate samples of E. coli at approximately same fluence. A 350 nm continuous wave flash lamb, with output configuration close to that of the 3 rd harmonic of the laser, was also used for the purpose of comparison. The result indicates that the log reductions for the laser wavelengths are higher (almost double) that of continuous wave light.

In this effort, the effect of cavitating conditions created by differential pump valve opening and that created by flowing through a cavitating element (orifice plates) on the microbes (zooplankton in seawater) is described. The experimental results are compared with modeling of cavitating conditions that includes cavity dynamics, turbulence generated by individual oscillating cavity, cell wall strength and geometrical & operating parameters of cavitation device. Theoretical model for quantifying the cavitationally generated turbulent shear and extent of <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> has been developed. Experimental results indicated that cavitation and/or turbulent fluid shear dominantly originating from cavitation are effective tools for seawater disinfection as more than 80 % of the Zooplankton present in the seawater were killed. It was also observed that shock waves generated due to cavitation is not the sole cause for zooplankton disruption.

40|$|In this study, {{surface and}} ground water {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of disinfection processes (chlorination, chloramination, ozonation, UV irradiation and hydrogen peroxide) on bacterial regrowth and bioftlm formation in potable water distribution systems using laboratoryscale units. Disinfection was carried out using disinfectant concentrations which were {{as close as possible to}} those used in practise. The parameters that were {{used to evaluate the}} bactericidal effectiveness of each disinfectant were coliform bacteria, heterotrophic plate count and total bacteria. Membrane filter and standard spread plate procedures were used to enumerate coliform and heterotrophic plate count bacteria respectively. The epifluorescence direct count involving DAPI was used to enumerate total bacteria. The scanning electron microscopy technique was used to visualize biofilm formation on stainless steel and cement coupons. The <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> efficacy of all disinfectants was found to be equal in the elimination of coliform bacteria in surface water although recovery of coliforms occurred 24 h after disinfection in all treated water systems with the exception of chloraminated water systems. For the groundwater, all disinfectants were found to remove coliform bacteria within the first hours of disinfection with the exception of hydrogen peroxide. Complete removal of coliform bacteria by hydrogen peroxide occurred only 48 h after disinfection. In surface water systems, more than 99 % (average kill percentage) of heterotrophic bacteria were removed by all the disinfection processes. Chloramination and hydrogen peroxide disinfection, however, resulted in a higher effective disinfection (average 99. 99 %) although a longer period of time (between 24 and 72 h for chloramination and 72 h for hydrogen peroxide) was required to achieve this kill percentage. In groundwater systems, more than 99. 90 % (average kill percentage) heterotrophic bacteria were removed by all the disinfectants with the exception of hydrogen peroxide (99. 88 % average kill percentage). However, ozone was highly effective within the first 2 has shown by the average kill percentage of 99. 999 % of heterotrophic bacteria. These results led to the conclusion that the <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> efficacy was greater when using groundw~ter than when using surface water. The phenomenon of bacterial regrowth was linked to the absence of concentrations of disinfectant residuals. In both water sources, bacterial regrowth occurred earlier in chlorinated, ozonated and UV treated water than in chloraminated and hydrogen peroxide treated water. Significantly higher heterotrophic bacteria counts were noted in chlorine, ozone and UV treated waters than either in chloramine or hydrogen peroxide treated waters. The greater persistence of monochloramine and hydrogen peroxide residuals was found to inhibit bacterial regrowth in both test waters.

It has been demonstrated that the application of ultrasound can be used to control microbial activity although, the ultrasonic power required for complete <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> through the loss of cellular membrane integrity is relatively high. This research investigated the effects of sonication at frequencies of 20, 40 and 580 kHz on the viability of two microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Key to the assessment of the efficiency of ultrasonic decontamination is a method for the measurement of remaining live cells after sonication and this is generally achieved using viable plate count methodology. This technique assesses the number of colony forming units (CFU’s) remaining in the sample but a CFU can be either a single cell or an agglomerate of bacterial cells. An alternative method for estimation of cell viability is flow cytometry which can be used to identify and quantify both viable/dead bacteria and particulate material/cell debris in the liquid bulk following fluorescent staining (Thiozal orange and Propidium iodide). Here we compare the results from viable plate counts with flow cytometry and demonstrate a good correlation between them. The flow cytometry results for E. coli and K. pneumonia indicated a high sensitivity to 20 and 40 kHz frequency with a continuous decrease in the viable cell count and an increase in dead and particulate matter (cell debris) during experiments. In contrast; results using the higher frequency of 580 kHz at different power settings indicated a predominance of de-agglomeration of bacterial clumps rather than cell disruption...|$|E
40|$|Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is {{produced}} naturally by neutrophils and other cells to kill conventional microbes in vivo. Synthetic preparations containing HOCl {{can also be}} effective as microbial disinfectants. Here we have tested whether HOCl can also inactivate prions and other self-propagating protein amyloid seeds. Prions are deadly pathogens that are notoriously difficult to inactivate, and standard <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> protocols are often inadequate. Recommended treatments for prion decontamination include strongly basic (pH ≥~ 12) sodium hypochlorite bleach, ≥ 1 N sodium hydroxide, and/or prolonged autoclaving. These treatments are damaging and/or unsuitable for many clinical, agricultural and environmental applications. We have tested the anti-prion activity of a weakly acidic aqueous formulation of HOCl (BrioHOCl) that poses no apparent hazard to either users or many surfaces. For example, BrioHOCl can be applied directly to skin and mucous membranes and has been aerosolized to treat entire rooms without apparent deleterious effects. Here, we demonstrate that immersion in BrioHOCl can inactivate not only a range of target microbes, including spores of Bacillus subtilis, but also prions in tissue suspensions and on stainless steel. Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays showed that BrioHOCl treatments eliminated all detectable prion seeding activity of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, cervine chronic wasting disease, sheep scrapie and hamster scrapie; these findings indicated reductions of ≥ 103 - to 106 -fold. Transgenic mouse bioassays showed that all detectable hamster-adapted scrapie infectivity in brain homogenates or on steel wires was eliminated, representing reductions of ≥~ 105. 75 -fold and > 104 -fold, respectively. Inactivation of RT-QuIC seeding activity correlated with free chlorine concentration and higher order aggregation or destruction of proteins generally, including prion protein. BrioHOCl treatments had similar effects on amyloids composed of human α-synuclein and a fragment of human tau.

Wastewater characteristics such as suspended solids (SS), turbidity, iron content, transmittance at 254 nm, and dissolved organic carbon were monitored to assess their effect on UV disinfection. Fecal coliforms were used as indicators to measure disinfection performance. UV disinfection was capable of reducing the fecal coliform counts from typical values of 0. 2 - 3 million CFU/ 100 ml (depending on the process and season) to thousands, hundreds or tens per 100 ml, depending on the dose applied, the process used for phosphorus removal, and wastewater quality. High turbidity values yielded higher surviving <b>microbial</b> counts; <b>disinfection</b> effectiveness decreased by 10 % for each NTU of turbidity increase. SS in the wastewater scattered the UV light, leading to dose underestimations and the illusion that higher SS would yield better disinfection effectiveness. A photoreactivation increase of 8. 1 and 11. 7 fold was observed for iron-treated and alum-treated effluents respectively.

These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes.

40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{and zinc}} oxide (ZnO) {{nanoparticles}} are important photocatalysts {{and as such}} have been extensively studied {{for the removal of}} organic compounds from contaminated air and water and for <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Despite much research on the effect of TiO 2 and ZnO nanoparticles on different bacterial species, uncertainties remain about which bacteria are more sensitive to these compounds. Very few studies have directly compared the toxicity of ZnO to TiO 2 under both light and dark conditions. In addition, authors investigating the photocatalytic inactivation of TiO 2 and ZnO nanoparticles on bacteria have failed to investigate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of the nanoparticles, making it difficult to correlate killing action with the generation of ROS. In this study, three types of metal nanoparticle (ZnO < 50 nm, ZnO < 100 nm and TiO 2) have been characterised and ROS production assessed through the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The photocatalytic killing potential of three nanoparticle concentrations (0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 g/L) was then assessed on four representative bacteria: two gram-positive (S. aureus and B. subtilis) and two gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). Results showed that out of the three nanoparticles tested, the TiO 2 nanoparticles generated more ROS than the ZnO nanoparticles, corresponding to a greater photocatalytic inactivation of three of the four species of bacteria examined. The MB decomposition results correlated well with the bacterial inactivation results with higher TiO 2 nanoparticle concentrations leading to greater ROS production and increased loss of cell viability. Although producing less ROS than the TiO 2 nanoparticles under ultraviolet light, the ZnO nanoparticles were toxic to two of the bacterial species even under dark conditions. In this study, no correlation between cell wall type and bacterial inactivation was observed for any of the nanoparticles tested although both gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to ROS production. P. aeruginosa cells were resistant to all types of treatment and highlight a potential limitation to the application of these nanoparticles for water treatment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|Lagrangian {{actinometry}} (LA) {{has shown}} advantages {{as a tool}} for validation of UV reactors, such as ability to measure dose distribution. However, several problems involving dyed microspheres (DMS) used in LA have been identified. First, ambient particles present in some water sources could have similar sizes and fluorescence intensity (FI) with the DMS, and could interfere in flow cytometry analysis. Second, the wavelength-dependent dose responses of DMS need to be examined for validation of polychromatic UV reactors. Third, LA applications of high dose range (more than 200 mJ/cm 2) for inactivation of UV-resistant microorganisms have not been studied. The primary goal of this research is to develop DMS method for validation of “high dose” reactors. ^ A collimated medium-pressure (MP) UV source and bandpass optical filters were used to conduct wavelength-dependent dose-response experiments for three different types of DMS (nominally 6, 10 and 15 µm) over the entire germicidal UV spectrum for a UV dose range of 0 – 450 mJ/cm 2. Internal (microsphere) standards were implemented and applied for wavelength-dependent dose-response samples to calibrate the measurements in flow cytometry. In applying this approach, variations of the instrument optical responses were reduced. Action spectra of three different types of DMS were established. The action spectra of 6 and 10 µm DMS were similar to several microorganisms within the most effective range of wavelengths for a MP UV disinfection system, which supports the ability of prediction of <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> performance using LA. A 3 -LPHO-lamp reactor and an 18 -LPHO-lamp reactor were validated by LA and biodosimetry using three different sizes of DMS, 6, 10 and 15 µm and environmental isolates of Bacillus pumilus spores. Four flow rates were applied for validation of each reactor. There were some significant variations between replicate samples at lower flow rates for the 3 -lamp reactor, possibly due to instabilities of the reactor at low flow rates. The ability to capture these variations is also beneficial to understand the limitation of the reactor. LA and biodosimetry results did not agree with each other for the 18 -lamp-reactor test, possibly due to extrapolation of DMS dose responses, uncertainty in spore dose-response relationship, and sample contamination. ...|$|E
40|$|Ozonation is {{currently}} {{considered as one}} of the most effective <b>microbial</b> <b>disinfection</b> technologies due to its powerful disinfection capacity and reduction in levels of chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBP). However, ozonation of waters containing bromide can produce bromate ion above regulated levels, leading to tradeoffs between microbial and chemical risks. In efforts to meet increasingly stringent drinking water regulations and to be cost-effective, water suppliers are required to optimize ozone dosage. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and flexible tool to accurately describe ozone disinfection processes and contribute to their design and operation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has come into use recently for evaluating disinfection systems. However, the focus of its application has been largely on modelling the hydraulic behaviour of contactors, which is only one component of system design. The significance of this dissertation is that a fully comprehensive three dimensional (3 D) multiphase CFD model has been developed to address all the major components of ozone disinfection processes: contactor hydraulics, ozone mass transfer, ozone decay, and microbial inactivation. The model was validated using full-scale experimental data, including tracer test results and ozone profiles from full-scale ozone contactors in two Canadian drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) : the DesBaillets WTP in Montréal, Quebec and the Mannheim WTP in Kitchener, Ontario. Good agreement was observed between the numerical simulation and experimental data. The CFD model was applied to investigate ozone contactor performance at the DesBaillets WTP. The CFD-predicted flow fields showed that recirculation zones and short circuiting existed in the DesBaillets contactors. The simulation results suggested that additional baffles could be installed to increase the residence time and improve disinfection efficiency. The CFD model was also used to simulate ozone contactor performance at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant before and after installing new liquid oxygen (LOX) ozone generators and removing some diffusers from the system. The modelling results indicated that such changes led to an increase in effective residence time, and therefore an adjustment to operational parameters was required after system modification. Another significant contribution is that, for the first time, the Eulerian and Lagrangian (or particle tracking) approaches, two commonly utilized methods for predicting microbial inactivation efficiency have been compared for the study of ozone disinfection processes. The modelling results of two hypothetical ozone reactors and a full scale contactor suggested that the effective CT values predicted by the Lagriangian approach were slightly lower than those obtained from the Eulerian approach but their differences were within 10 %. Therefore, both approaches can be used to predict ozone disinfection efficiency. For the full scale contactor investigated, the tracer residence time distribution predicted by the Euerlian approach provided a better fit to the experimental results, which indicated that the Eulerian approach might be more suitable for the simulation of chemical tracer performance. The results of this part of work provided important insight in understanding the complex performance of multiphase ozonation systems and played an important role in further improving CFD modelling approaches for full-scale ozone disinfection systems. The third significant contribution of this work is that a CFD model was applied to illustrate the importance of ozone residual monitoring locations and suggest an improved strategy for ozone residual monitoring. For the DesBaillets ozone contactors, the CFD modelling results showed that ozone residuals in the cross section of the outlets of some contactor chambers differed by an order of magnitude. The “optimal” area of monitoring locations however varied at different operational conditions. Therefore, it was suggested that multiple ozone residual sampling points should be installed based on CFD analysis and experimental studies, to provide more accurate indicators to system operators. The CFD model was also used to study the factors affecting the residence time distribution (RTD). The results suggested that the selection of the tracer injection locations as well as tracer sampling locations might affect the RTD prediction or measurement. The CFD-predicted T 10 values at different outlet locations varied by more than 10 % variation. It is therefore recommended that CFD modelling be used to determine tracer test strategy before conducting a full-scale tracer test, and multiple sampling points should be employed during tracer tests, if possible. In addition, a research based on full-scale investigation has also been done to compare the three different CT prediction approaches: CT 10, integrated disinfection design framework (IDDF), and CFD, to determine the most appropriate method for design and operation of ozone systems. The CFD approach yielded more accurate predictions of inactivation efficacy than the other two approaches. The current results also suggested that the differences in the three approaches in CT predictions became smaller at higher contactor T 10 /T ratios conditions as the contactors performed more closely to ideal plug flow reactors. This study has demonstrated that the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is an efficient tool for improving ozone disinfection performance of existing water treatment plants and designing new ozonation systems. The model developed in this study can be used for ozone contactor design, evaluation, and troubleshooting. It can also be used as a virtual experimental tool to optimize ozone contactor behaviour under varying water quality and operational conditions...|$|E

Although drug resistance will likely persist and is to be expected, the overall level can be dramatically decreased with increased attention to antibiotic overuse and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different drug formulations, {{and the use of}} proper hygiene and protective barriers. Implementation of such practices as microbial surveillance and prophylaxis has been shown to result in decreased hospital length of stay, health care costs and mortality due to drug-resistant infections. This review will summarize current progress in preventative techniques aimed at reducing the incidence of infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains. By employing a variety of prevention strategies, including proper personal hygiene, prescreening for carrier status before hospital admission, disinfection of hospital rooms, and careful monitoring of antimicrobial prescribing, marked progress can be achieved in the control of drug-resistant pathogens, which can translate into more effective antimicrobial therapy.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{control of}} {{cross-infection}} is an imperative issue {{when dealing with}} dental impression materials in Dentistry {{and the lack of}} procedures for its control is currently a real problem. The aims of the present study consisted in evaluating the effectiveness of water washing and sodium hypochlorite disinfection in reducing the microbial load of alginate after mouth contact. Materials and methodsThirteen students voluntarily participated in the present study. The inclusion criteria were age between 21 and 24 years, inexistence of smoking habits and systemic and salivary gland pathologies, DMFT index (decay/missing/filled teeth) ≤ 5 and tooth brushing with right hand. For each participant, one impression was taken in alginate from the mandibular arch. These samples were submitted to water wash and sodium hypochlorite disinfection and to subsequent microbiological analysis. Statistical analysis included the analysis of variance for multiple comparisons (one-way ANOVA) followed by Student's t-test. ResultsAfter mouth contact, alginate microbial count increased from 1. 59 ± 2. 79 to 2. 68 × 103 ± 6. 19 × 102 CFU/mm 2. It was verified that after water wash the microbial count decreased to 48. 5 % while after sodium hypochlorite <b>disinfection</b> <b>microbial</b> count decreased to 99. 99 %. ConclusionDental impression materials can act as vectors transmitting a significant amount of microorganisms. Sodium hypochlorite disinfection is an efficient disinfection method for alginate impressions.

40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} decade the use of {{titanium}} dioxide {{has been the focus}} of water purification studies for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. Various studies have shown that TiO 2 photocatalysis is a very efficient process for removal (by mineralization) of a large variety of hazardous chemicals. However, the potential use of this technology for water disinfection has been essentially unexplored. Only a few papers have described the photocatalytic destruction of microbial cells, such as E. coli bacteria, MS 2 bacteriophages and recently B. fragilis phages, D. radiophilus. The mechanism of photocatalysis in the presence of TiO 2 is the enhanced formation of hydroxyl (HO·) radicals, active in oxidation processes. The HO · radicals have a significant effect on chemical oxidation of anthropogenic organic compounds in the environment. Complete mineralization of many organic substances is possible in aqueous systems, when sufficient HO · radical flux can be generated in situ. Various water treatment technologies inherently produce HO · radicals in relatively minuscule quantities (i. e., < 10 – 12 M). Examples of such processes include ozonation, direct photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, and radiolysis. In contrast to the above system, steadystate HO · concentrations of the order of 10 – 9 M can be generated in UV-irradiated aqueous suspensions of immobilised particles of titanium dioxide. The use of TiO 2 for <b>microbial</b> inactivation and <b>disinfection</b> of potable water is suggested, since free radicals such as HO · might act as a strong biocide, because of its hig...|$|R
40|$|Indoor environments, {{where people}} {{spend most of}} their time, are {{characterized}} by a specific microbial community, the indoor microbiome. Most indoor environments are connected to the natural environment by high ventilation, but some habitats are more confined: intensive care units, operating rooms, cleanrooms and the international space station (ISS) are extraordinary living and working areas for humans, with a limited exchange with the environment. The purposes for confinement are different: a patient has to be protected from infections (intensive care unit, operating room), product quality has to be assured (cleanrooms), or confinement is necessary due to extreme, health-threatening outer conditions, as on the ISS. The ISS represents the most secluded man-made habitat, constantly inhabited by humans since November 2000 – and, inevitably, also by microorganisms. All of these man-made confined habitats need to be microbiologically monitored and controlled, by e. g. <b>microbial</b> cleaning and <b>disinfection.</b> However, these measures apply constant selective pressures, which support microbes with resistance capacities against antibiotics or chemical and physical stresses and thus facilitate the rise of survival specialists and multi-resistant strains. In this article, we summarize the available data on the microbiome of aforementioned confined habitats. By comparing the different operating, maintenance and monitoring procedures as well as microbial communities therein, we emphasize the importance to properly understand the effects of confinement on the microbial diversity, the possible risks represented by some of these microorganisms and by the evolution of (antibiotic) resistances in such environments - and the need to reassess the current hygiene standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary concern}} {{associated}} with water reuse practices {{is the public}} health risk caused by the potential exposure to microbial contaminants, such as pathogenic protozoa, bacteria and viruses. The detection and removal of microbial pathogens is therefore of great importance to ensure the reclaimed water is “safe” for the intended end uses. This research studied the microbial pathogen removal in three different water reuse schemes. In the first study, a rapid direct virus detection method based on Accuri C 6 flow cytometry (FCM) was developed to quantify the virus removal rate in a water reclamation plant using microfiltration-reverse osmosis (MF-RO) process for indirect potable reuse water production. This new method, in combination with online total organic carbon and nanoparticle analysis, has {{shown to be a}} viable way for online monitoring of high-pressure RO membrane integrity and the potential breakthrough of viral particles. In the second study, the effectiveness of microbial pathogen removal by constructed stormwater wetlands (CSW) in the U. S. and Australia was investigated using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and 454 -pyrosequcing techniques. The results showed that the two US CSW and one of the three Australian CSW had good performance in terms of indicator bacteria removal during dry weather flow. The treated stormwater can meet the recreational water quality criteria/guidelines. No Cryptosporidium was detected in any of the CSW, while Adenovirus were present at all sites. Human specific HF 183 Bacteroides were only found in Australian sites indicating the potential contamination from sewage ingression. The microbial community analysis showed a clear increase of Cyanobacteria in the outflow of CSW with better performance. The water residence time was determined as a critical factor affecting the efficacy of microbial pathogen removal or inactivation. In the last study, pathogen removal efficiency was investigated in a solar-powered mobile toilet system for decentralized wastewater treatment. The wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) uses solar energy to generate oxidants via electrochemical (EC) reaction for of <b>microbial</b> pathogen <b>disinfection.</b> The results showed 5 log 10 reductions of bacteria (E. coli and Enterococcus) and viruses (coliphage MS 2 and adenovirus) were achieved within 1 h reaction at applied cell voltage of + 4 V. The dominating role of free reactive chlorine generated in situ during EC disinfection process was verified using laboratory model waters. The formation of organic disinfection byproducts trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAA 5) during EC treatment were found to increase with the rise of applied cell voltage. The EC treated toilet wastewater is suitable for many non-potable reuse applications (e. g., toilet flushing and irrigation) with significantly reduced microbial infection risk. As {{there is no need for}} supporting chemicals, the WEC system can be developed into commercial viable, self-sufficient, solar-powered mobile toilets for decentralized wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|Microbes {{survive for}} an {{extended}} period of time on fomites. With new strains of pathogens constantly emerging, it is important to understand their survival and spread and to evaluate the efficiency of new disinfection methods. The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of pathogens on fomites, and evaluate different disinfection methods (household bleach and steam vapor). Fomites were sampled in a variety of environments for the presence of pathogens including methicillin intermediate- and resistant- Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Penecillium brevi-compactum, Alternaria alternata and novel H 1 N 1 influenza A. Samples were assayed using both cultural and genetic techniques to determine the <b>microbial</b> occurrence. In <b>disinfection</b> studies, samples were collected before and after disinfectant application. Steam vapor was effective at reducing microbial occurrence by> 90 % with a minimal contact time of 10 - 20 seconds on hospital fomites. The material and shape of the surface had an effect on the reduction rate, due to access of the disinfecting agent. In addition, low levels of initial contamination limited the reduction rate. Many surfaces had a starting contamination level of less than 3 log 10 and after disinfection the contamination levels, in 69 % of the samples, were at or near the limit of detection. This suggests a higher reduction is feasible. Household bleach reduced the presence of mold spores and mycelium by > 99 % on gypsum-wall board. Reduction rates were influenced by the growth stage of mold, with the mycelium requiring additional disinfectant application to achieve the 99 % reduction rate. Novel H 1 N 1 influenza A was not recovered on any surfaces in day care facilities and elementary schools. This is consistent with previous studies looking at H 1 N 1 influenza occurrence in similar environments, though it is different from H 3 N 2 influenza A studies. Survival differences among varying influenza strains are expected to have an impact on pathogen spread and human health risks. Differences can be quantitatively evaluated and used to develop more advanced risk assessment models. Steam vapor and household bleach are effective at reducing risks of pathogens in the environment and are critical interventions in an overall strategy to minimize exposure and prevent disease...|$|R
40|$|Plasma is {{a growing}} field of non-thermal {{processing}} research for <b>microbial</b> inactivation and <b>disinfection</b> of food and food contact surfaces. An extensive {{review of the literature}} revealed that plasma can be generated from many forms of electromagnetic waves ranging from DC to microwaves under vacuum or atmospheric conditions. Part of this review catalogued a wide variety of techniques for plasma generation to serve as a reference source on this new processing technology. The thesis set out to investigate microwave cool plasma equipment design to establish a simulation model, using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio software, to assist in fabrication and further modification of laboratory and larger scale prototype low pressure microwave plasma devices. Also the effects of operational conditions with these equipment designs were determined by measuring plasma density using a Langmuir probe and surface temperatures by fibre optic methods, at defined coordinates within treatment chambers of the devices. These results were used to confirm the simulation data. Using defined conditions, investigations were conducted on the inactivation of vegetative cells of bacterial food pathogens, Salmonella and Listeria and spores of food spoilage bacteria Geobacillus and Bacillus using low temperature plasma. The temperature ranges of the surface to be sterilised were determined to be less than 45 degrees C. The thesis attempted to determine the mechanism of plasma inactivation by excluding the exposure of charged particles (using charged surfaces to attract or repel plasma particles) and UV radiation (using a quartz filter) and measuring inactivation of bacterial spores, in the presence and absence of these modifying treatments. Given the design configuration of equipment and operational conditions the investigations determined that UVC was the factor responsible for microbial inactivation effects. Other species such as electrons, ions, radicals and also the other ranges of UV (UVA and UVB) appeared to play no part in the process of microbial inactivation in the relatively short time periods investigated, where UVC acted to inactivate microorganisms. Microbial inactivation effects of up to ~ 4 log reduction (as determined by viable count) were achieved for bacterial spores using both the laboratory scale and one metre plasma units. The presence of added organic load of dried milk solids to spore preparations moderated the inactivating effects of plasma. Nonetheless an approximately 2 log inactivation of Salmonella and Listeria adsorbed to the surfaces of almonds could still be achieved in a period of 60 s exposure. The work conducted in the thesis provides the first steps towards scaling up the design configuration of the one metre plasma unit to provide an array that can expose a larger area to plasma treatment...|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{disinfection}} using UV irradiation as {{a primary}} disinfectant and free chlorine or monochloramine as a secondary disinfectant was investigated in this study, to determine the synergistic effects on <b>microbial</b> inactivation and <b>disinfection</b> by-products (DBP) formation. Microbial inactivation kinetics was investigated using MS 2 bacteriophage as the surrogate, and trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation was measured. Residual consumption during sequential exposures was also investigated. Two types of synergistic effects were observed in microbial inactivation. UV pre-treatment or co-treatment in the primary disinfection stage with either low-pressure (LP) or medium-pressure (MP) UV irradiation resulted in the enhancement {{in the rate of}} secondary inactivation when either free chlorine or monochloramine was used. The secondary inactivation rates were 1. 28 - 2. 74 (free chlorine) and 2 - 5 (monochloramine) times faster than those data obtained without pre-UV or co-UV irradiation. The enhancement was also found to increase with increasing UV dose. A synergistic effect in MS 2 coliphage inactivation was also observed by simultaneous exposure to both disinfectants during the primary disinfection stage. The gross kill under such simultaneous exposure were 0. 04 - 2. 38 (chlorine) and 0. 63 - 2. 7 (monochloramine) log larger than the sum of log inactivation achieved by each of the two disinfectants at the same doses. Similar trends were observed when using different UV sources (LP and MP lamps) and different secondary disinfectants (free chlorine or monochloramine). In DBP formation, DBP formation potential (DBPFP) and changes in UV absorbance spectra were also measured. In all cases, UV pre-irradiation led to an increase in free chlorine consumption but a beneficial decrease in monochloramine consumption. While rapid decomposition of both chlorine and monochloramine were observed under co-exposure with UV irradiation. Exposure to LPUV irradiation in all approaches induced substantial changes in humic acid composition and increased the time-dependent DBP formation compared to sole chlorination or monochloramination, with highest DBP formation in co-exposure approaches. However, only the NH 2 CI/MPUV approach resulted in a similar manner as LPUV, while other approaches under exposure to MPUV irradiation generally reduced the DBP formation instead. The yields of DBPs were higher using free chlorine compared to monochloramine in all cases. DBPFP generally followed the similar manner as time-dependent DBP formation in all cases, with unexpected low DBPFP in HOCI/MPUV and MPUV/NH 2 CI approaches. In addition, coagulated humic acid solutions resulted in reduction in DBP formation in all sequential approaches compared to that of raw humic acid solutions using MPUV irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Swimming {{and aquatic}} {{activities}} are popular among all age {{group in the}} United State, but these activities are also associated with health risks for the participants by exposure to <b>microbial</b> pathogens and <b>disinfection</b> byproducts (DPBs). <b>Microbial</b> pathogens can be controlled through water-treatment methods, including Filtration and chlorination. However, less {{is known about the}} effects of these processes on DBP dynamic. Many studies have indicated, in general terms, that DPBs in pools are formed form reactions between free chlorine and precursor chemicals that are introduced to pools by swimmers via human fluids (sweat and urine). However, relatively little information is available in the literature to characterize the behavior of volatile DBPs in the gas and liquid phases under this condition. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has emerged as a secondary disinfectant, as well as a process that can alter water and air chemistry in pools. UV-based treatment is commonly used in treatment of swimming pool water, almost always in conjunction with chlorination. The motivations for inclusion of UV in these settings include the ability to inactivate some chlorine-resistant microbes and the ability to reduce the concentration of inorganic chloramines by photolysis. However, conflicting results {{have been reported in the}} literature regarding the effects of UV-based treatment on DBPs formation. This appears to be particularly true when organic-N compounds are present as DBP precursors. However, the mechanisms behind these UV effects are not well defined. Therefore, this study includes two major goals: 1) to define the behavior of volatile DBPs and their precursors in an indoor, chlorinated swimming pool under a heavy use condition, and 2) to define the effects of the combined use of UV/chlorine on DBP formation from organic-N precursors. For field experiments, liquid- and gas-phase quality monitoring was conducted in several indoor, chlorinated swimming pool facilities to evaluate the dynamic behavior of volatile DBPs in swimming pool area under a heavy use condition. To examine UV-induced effects, UV irradiation and chlorination experiments were conducted with a series of organic-N compounds that are representative of those introduced to swimming pool via human sweat and urine. In field experiments, swimmer activity was identified to adversely affect air and water quality by promotion of the liquid 2 ̆ 6 Dot;gas phase transfer and introduction of DBP precursors. Air quality had a strong correlation with the bather number; gas-phase NCl 3 concentration increased with swimmer activity. Liquid-phase concentrations of several volatile DBPs showed a diurnal pattern where near-surface concentration deceased during periods of pool use (day time) and recovered during period of inactivity. This behavior was believed to be associated with the promotion of liquid 2 ̆ 6 Dot;gas phase transfer by swimmer activity (decreasing in daytime) and the recirculation pattern of the pool (overnight). Additionally, a dynamic pattern of behavior of volatile DBPs was observed in near-surface water during a 3 -hour swimming practice section. Vertical stratification of the water column was also observed. In laboratory experiments, volatile DBP formation from nitrous DBP precursors was enhanced with co-exposure of UV irradiation and chlorination (CH 3 NCl 2 from creatinine, CNCl for L-arginine, L-histidine and glycine); free chlorine consumption increased when UV irradiation was involved. In addition, inorganic chloramine re-formation was observed in post-chlorination of UV-irradiated samples. Dichloromethylamine (CH 3 NCl 2) was indentified to be UV sensitive, and the photolysis of CH 3 NCl 2 resulted in cyanogen chloride (CNCl) formation. Similarly, CNCl formation was also detected from photolysis of chlorinated guanidine or imidazole compounds. Collectively, UV-irradiation appears to promote N-Cl bond cleavage among chlorinated precursor moieties and resulting in formation of DBPs or intermediates that are more susceptible to chlorination. The results of this work have allowed for understanding the influences of swimmer behavior on water or air quality, and for definition of a mechanism of DBP formation from the combined application of chlorine and UV. The results of field experiments suggest that changes in pool operations and swimmer hygiene habits could improve air and water qualities in swimming pool facilities. The laboratory results of this work have implications with respect to the application of chlorine and UV for water treatment in swimming pool facilities, and in other settings where these two forms of treatment may be used together, including reuse applications and UV/chlorine-based advanced oxidation processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{swimming}} {{is known}} to be beneficial in terms of cardiovascular health, as well as some forms of rehabilitation, swimming is also known to present risks to human health, largely in the form of exposure to <b>microbial</b> pathogens and <b>disinfection</b> byproducts (DBPs). Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for swimming pools. The two primary goals of applying chlorine in water treatment are inactivation of microbial pathogens and oxidation of soluble organic compounds. However, important drawbacks of swimming pool chlorination include limited efficacy against some microbial pathogens, particularly Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia, and the formation of potentially harmful DBPs. Acute and chronic human health problems associated with exposure to DBPs in swimming pools have been identified. ^ In recent years, combined UV/chlorine treatment has been applied with increasing frequency to swimming pool water because UV irradiation {{is known to}} be effective for inactivation of some chlorine-resistant microbial pathogens (e. g., C. parvum and G. lamblia), and {{it has the potential to}} promote photodecay of some disinfection by-products (DBPs) (e. g., inorganic chloramines). However, it has also been reported in the literature that UV-based treatment has the potential to promote formation of some DBPs (e. g., CNCl and CNCHCl 2). Promotion of these and other reactions also results in increases of free chlorine consumption rates. Because some residual chlorine compounds and DBPs are volatile, their presence in pools implies a potential to influence air quality in the vicinity of pools, especially for indoor pool facilities. Hence, UV irradiation has the potential to alter water and air chemistry in indoor pools. To date, observations of the effects of UV-based treatment on water chemistry in the presence of residual chlorine and DBP precursors in swimming pools have been largely anecdotal and incomplete. In addition, there are uncertainties about the UV source type (i. e., low-pressure [LP] or medium-pressure [MP] Hg lamps) to use as a secondary swimming pool water treatment process. ^ This study was conducted to further examine this issue by exploring water and air chemistry in a chlorinated indoor swimming pool under three different operating conditions: conventional chlorination (1 st year) which served as a control, chlorination augmented by MP UV irradiation (2 nd year), and chlorination augmented by LP UV irradiation (3 rd year). The UV systems were installed in an existing recirculation system as a secondary disinfectant. Water samples were collected from the pool five days per week during the academic year and once per week during summer for measurement of pH, temperature, total alkalinity, free and combined chlorine, eleven volatile DBPs, and urea concentration. In addition, for observation of air quality in the target indoor pool, measurements of gas-phase NCl 3 concentration and corrosion rates of four metal alloys were conducted. The aim of this study was to examine formation and degradation of volatile DBPs, so as to improve our understanding of the changes in water and air chemistry that will result from UV irradiation of chlorinated swimming pool water. ^ After installation of MP UV, the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr 2 Cl) increased, whereas the concentrations of dichloromethylamine (CH 3 NCl 2), monochloramine (NH 2 Cl), dichloramine (NHCl 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), bromoform (CHBr 3) and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) decreased. LP UV irradiation also decreased CHCl 3 (more efficiently than MP UV) and CNBr concentrations; while CHBr 3, CHBr 2 Cl concentrations were increased compare to the control year. The cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and trichloramine (NCl 3) concentrations observed in the first year and after inclusion of both UV sources (MP and LP UV) of the study were not statistically significantly different. In addition, changes in the concentrations of DCAN, CH 3 NCl 2, NH 2 Cl, and NHCl 2 were statistically insignificant after inclusion of LP UV, as compared to the control year. ^ A large fraction of the existing literature regarding swimming pool air quality has focused on trichloramine (NCl 3). For this work, gas-phase NCl 3 was analyzed by an air sparging-DPD/KI method. The results showed that gas-phase NCl 3 concentration depends on the bather loading and liquid-phase NCl 3 concentration. However, an apparent “negative” concentration of gas-phase NCl 3 was observed after inclusion of UV sources as a secondary water treatment, which cannot be interpreted literally, and appears to be attributable to a source of interference in the assay. Thus, this study indicates a limitation of this analytical method for measuring trichloramine in the gas-phase by applying combined UV/ chlorine water treatment in indoor pools. ^ Among four different corrosion coupons (carbon steel, galvanized, aluminum, and 304 -stainless steel) which were installed in different locations of the target swimming pool, carbon steel had the highest corrosion rate. After installation of UV sources, the corrosion rates of these metal alloys changed, as compared to the control year; particularly after inclusion of LP UV as a secondary water treatment, the corrosion rate for all metal alloys increased significantly, which again confirmed that UV irradiation would alter water and air chemistry in indoor pools. ^ Urea is the dominant organic-N compound in human urine and sweat, and {{is known to be}} one of the important precursors for producing NCl 3 in swimming pools. Results of daily measurements of urea indicated a link between bather load and urea concentration in the pool. Urea concentration was unaffected by UV-based treatment. ^ Collectively, these results imply an overall improvement in water quality as a result of the inclusion of the both UV systems; and MP UV was more efficient than LP UV for reducing most of the eleven volatile DBPs concentration in this pool. However, a need exists to standardize the application of UV systems in recreational water settings. ^ The results of this study are also expected to benefit UV/chlorine applications in other water treatment settings, such as treatment of drinking water, wastewater, or in water reuse facilities. ...|$|R
