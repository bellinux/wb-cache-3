5|$|In 2002, {{through the}} 86th Amendment Act, Article 21(A) was incorporated. It <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to primary {{education}} {{part of the}} right to freedom, stating that the State would provide free and compulsory education to children from six to fourteen years of age. Six years after an amendment was made in the Indian Constitution, the union cabinet cleared the Right to Education Bill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello braked earlier which forced him {{to make contact with}} teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the battle}} was an Israeli victory, the {{casualties}} sustained would surround Sharon with controversy. In particular, Sharon was criticized for ordering the attack on Jebel Heitan without authorization, and not realizing that with the Israeli Air Force controlling the skies, his men were in not such danger from the Egyptian tanks as he believed. Dayan himself maintained that Sharon was correct to order the attack without orders, and that under the circumstances, Sharon <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision; instead he criticized Sharon for his tactics of attacking the Egyptians head-on, which Dayan claimed led to unnecessary casualties.|$|E

25|$|Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally {{is still}} in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s {{apparently}} glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choices and considers how things might have been ("The Road You Didn't Take"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) ("In Buddy’s Eyes"). But it is clear that Sally {{is still in}} love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.|$|E
25|$|Portland was mediocre in {{the first}} half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs {{approached}} and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49–33 win–loss record. While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game. O'Neal doubted for a while if he had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.|$|E
25|$|The sensational {{incident}} {{of the track}} events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100m and 200m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt {{that she had been}} overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choice saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.|$|E

25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils {{down some of the}} hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision in not trying to save him.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E

500|$|Villanova coach Jay Wright {{considered}} redshirting Hilliard in {{his freshman}} season, but Wright {{decided against it}} after a rash of injuries to his players. He had 13 points in back-to-back games against Penn and Missouri in December 2011. As a freshman, Hilliard averaged 4.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 18.1 minutes per game in 29 games and shot 29.2 percent from behind the 3-point arc. During the season, {{he reached out to}} his family and friends to see if he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> decision to come to Villanova.
