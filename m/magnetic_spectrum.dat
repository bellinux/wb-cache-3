Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the luminescence of diamonds with negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) vs. applied magnetic field (<b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum)</b> was studied. A narrow line in zero magnetic field was discovered. The properties of this line are considerably {{different from those of}} other narrow <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> lines. Its magnitude is weakly dependent of the orientation of the single-crystal sample to the external magnetic field. This line is also observed in a powdered sample.

40|$|One type {{of order}} that has been {{observed}} to compete with superconductivity in cuprates involves alternating charge and antiferromagnetic stripes. Recent neutron scattering studies indicate that the magnetic excitation spectrum of a stripe-ordered sample {{is very similar to}} that observed in superconducting samples. In fact, it now appears {{that there may be a}} universal <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the cuprates. One likely implication of this universal spectrum is that stripes of a dynamic form are present in the superconducting samples. On cooling through the superconducting transition temperature, a gap opens in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and the weight lost at low energy piles up above the gap; the transition temperature is correlated with the size of the spin gap. Depending on the magnitude of the spin gap with respect to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the enhanced magnetic scattering at low temperature can be either commensurate or incommensurate.

There are no changes in the magnetic energy spectrum at large lengthscales but in the Kolmogorov regime we do find a difference. Our numerical results show that the Gaussian peak in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> becomes negatively skewed. The negatively skewed peak can be fitted with a beta distribution. Analytically one can relate the non-Gaussianity of the distribution to the temperature dependent vorticity term.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the universality of magnetic turbulence in space plasmas we analyze seven time periods in the free solar wind of different origin, slow or fast, and under different plasma conditions. The orientation of magnetic field to the flow velocity was always quasi-perpendicular. Unique combination of three instruments on Cluster spacecraft which operate in different frequency ranges give us the possibility to resolve spectra up to 300 Hz. We show that spectra measured under different plasma conditions have a similar shape. Such a quasi-universal spectrum consists of three parts: two power laws and an exponential domain. At MHD scales, Kolmogorov's law ∼ k^- 5 / 3 is found. At scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, a k^- 2. 8 law is observed. At scales kρ_e∼ (0. 1 - 1), where ρ_e is the electron gyroradius, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> follows an exponential law (-k^ 1 / 2), indicating the onset of dissipation.

40|$|Superconductivity in layered {{copper oxide}} {{compounds}} emerges when charge carriers {{are added to}} antiferromagnetically ordered CuO 2 layers. The carriers destroy the antiferromagnetic order, but strong spin fluctuations persist throughout the superconducting phase and are intimately linked to superconductivity. Neutron scattering measurements of spin fluctuations in hole doped copper oxides have revealed an unusual hour glass feature in the momentum resolved <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> that is present {{in a wide range}} of superconducting and non superconducting materials. There is no widely accepted explanation for this feature. One possibility is that it derives from a pattern of alternating spin and charge stripes 16, and this idea is supported by measurements on stripe ordered La 1. 875 Ba 0. 125 CuO 4. Many copper oxides without stripe order, however, also exhibit an hour glass spectrum. Here we report the observation of an hour glass <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> in a hole doped antiferromagnet from outside the family of superconducting copper oxides.

The 220 MHz proton <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>spectrum</b> {{of this small}} enzyme (about 15, 000 daltons) consists of several distinct resonance peaks that provide a sensitive nonperturbing probe of its conformational state. Comparison of catalytically active enzyme with preparations denatured in 6 M urea demonstrates dramatically the overall contribution of secondary and tertiary structure to its proton <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>spectra.</b> More subtle differences existing among several catalytically active enzyme forms may also be readily differentiated by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, e. g., the spectra of the ligand-free enzyme and forms containing stoichiometric amounts of tightly bound folate and dihydrofolate, each obtained separately by affinity chromatography, are easily identified.
