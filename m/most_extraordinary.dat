25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> woman (in art) that I have {{encountered}} in my life. It {{was as if}} she had diamonds in her bones and in her interior light struggled to come out through the pores of her skin.|$|E
25|$|Centered along Twentieth Street at Illinois Street, {{the site}} {{contains}} the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{example of an}} historic industrial village still extant in the West. The first locomotive, typewriter, printing press, cable car equipment, the famous battleship Oregon and steel for many of San Francisco's 19th century buildings came from the Potrero.|$|E
25|$|From Britannia comes an {{indication}} of the prosperity which freedom from taxes could bring. No sooner were the ravages of the enemy checked, than the island was deluged with a <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> plenty of all things, greater than was before known, and with it grew up every kind of luxury and licentiousness.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{describing}} the brief, brilliant, <b>most</b> [...] <b>extraordinary</b> campaigns of this chivalric and [...] picturesque commander Mr. Henty {{is in his}} element, [...] and the boy who does not follow the animated and [...] graphic narrative with rapture must sadly lack [...] spirit and pluck."--Civil Service Gazette.|$|R
50|$|According to the author, {{the book}} is a {{practical}} atlas of the characteristics that <b>most</b> define <b>extraordinary</b> leaders and their underlying psychological mechanisms. It was designed as a mirror to help executives think about how they approach leadership and gain insights that can enable them to grow and develop.|$|R
25|$|My object {{has been}} to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) {{striking}} passages of history, as they did of history & mythology. You will find all this very unlike Shakespeare; and {{so much the better}} in one sense, for I look upon him to be the worst of models, though the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> of writers.|$|E
25|$|Outside Lisbon, {{the church}} and chapter house of the Convent of the Order of Christ at Tomar (designed by Diogo de Arruda) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic {{sculptured}} organic and twisted rope forms, {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> achievements of the Manueline style.|$|E
25|$|The tale {{was first}} {{published}} as “The <b>Most</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> Thing” in an English translation by Horace Scudder in the United States in The Riverside Magazine for Young People in September 1870. The Danish original appeared in Denmark in the journal Nyt Dansk Maanedsskrift a month later in October 1870. The tale was reprinted in Denmark on 30 March 1872 and again on 20 December 1874 in collections of Andersen‘s tales.|$|E
50|$|<b>Most</b> of <b>extraordinary</b> {{examples}} of Montenegrin conduct during its long history {{can be traced}} to the code. Its importance is also reflected in the generally very low level of religiousness in the Montenegrin population. It is probably fair to say that the ethical beliefs of Montenegrins more closely match those of Stoicism than those of Christianity.|$|R
5000|$|In 1846 he {{patented}} {{the cold}} cure process for vulcanizing rubber, called by Thomas Hancock [...] "one of the <b>most</b> valuable and <b>extraordinary</b> discoveries of the age".|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to his own experience on the whaling ship Acushnet, two actual events served as the genesis for Melville's tale. One was {{the sinking of the}} Nantucket ship Essex in 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200km) from the western coast of South America. First mate Owen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821 Narrative of the <b>Most</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Pabst (June 11, 1826 – July 15, 1910) was a German-born American cabinetmaker of the Victorian Era. He is {{credited}} {{with some of the}} <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> custom interiors and hand-crafted furniture in the United States. Sometimes working in collaboration with architect Frank Furness (1839–1912), he made pieces in the Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Modern Gothic, and Colonial Revival styles. Examples of his work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.|$|E
25|$|In Müllerian mimicry an {{advantage}} is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, {{especially when the}} predator has a good memory for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide some of the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> examples of mimicry, and Müller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, {{and all of them}} wrote about it.|$|E

50|$|The Special Crime Investigation Department 007 {{is widely}} {{known by the}} others to have a weird and {{troublesome}} members. But this department actually includes the <b>most</b> capable and <b>extraordinary</b> investigators.|$|R
60|$|To {{close the}} whole, your Lordships shall how hear read an extract from a <b>most</b> curious and <b>extraordinary</b> letter, sent by {{him to the}} Court of Directors, preparatory to his return to England.|$|R
25|$|In 1802 {{she left}} Drury Lane and {{subsequently}} appeared {{from time to}} time on the stage of the rival establishment, Covent Garden. It was there, on 29 June 1812, that she gave perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> farewell performance in theatre history. She was playing her most famous role, Lady Macbeth, and the audience refused to allow the play to continue {{after the end of the}} sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her own clothes and character — whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily one of the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in}} the ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{claim by}} the VVS’s Il-2s is that, {{over a period}} of four hours, they {{destroyed}} 240 tanks and in the process virtually wiped out the 17th Panzer Division. On 1 July, the 17th Panzer Division had only one tank battalion (the II./Pz Rgt 39), with 67 tanks, 173 less than claimed destroyed by the VVS. The 17th Panzer Division was not even in the main attack sector, but further south with the 1st Panzer Army's 24th Panzer Corps. The 17th Panzer did not register any abnormal losses due to aircraft in the summer of 1943, and retreated westwards with Army Group South later in the year, still intact.|$|E
60|$|Tom nodded {{with great}} significance, and, {{falling into a}} state of deeper perplexity than before, {{observed}} that this was the <b>most</b> unaccountable and <b>extraordinary</b> circumstance he had ever heard of in his life.|$|R
5000|$|In this short, Sindbad the Sailor (presumably Bluto {{playing a}} [...] "role") proclaims himself, in song, {{to be the}} {{greatest}} sailor, adventurer and lover in the world and [...] "the <b>most</b> remarkable, <b>extraordinary</b> fellow," [...] a claim that is inadvertently challenged by Popeye as he innocently sings his usual song while sailing by within earshot of Sindbad's island with Olive Oyl and J. Wellington Wimpy on board. Sindbad orders his huge roc, to kidnap Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl, and wreck Popeye's ship, forcing him and Wimpy to swim to shore. Sinbad relishes making Olive his trophy wife, which is interrupted by Popeye's arrival. Sinbad then challenges the one-eyed sailor to a series of obstacles to prove his greatness, including fighting the roc, a two-headed giant named Boola (an apparent parody reference to The Three Stooges), and Sindbad himself. Popeye makes short work of the bird and the giant, but Sindbad almost gets the best of him until Popeye produces his can of spinach, which gives him the power to soundly defeat Sindbad and proclaim himself [...] "the <b>most</b> remarkable, <b>extraordinary</b> fella." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the last}} {{function}} that remained to be tested--and so by long odds the <b>most</b> amazing and <b>extraordinary</b> invention ever born of the brain of man stands completed and perfect. Livy is down stairs celebrating.|$|R
25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{episodes in}} Survival’s history {{took place in}} 1982 {{on the island of}} South Georgia when {{film-maker}} Cindy Buxton (a daughter of Aubrey) and assistant Annie Price were caught up in the Falklands War. The women were filming penguins when the island was invaded, and although Argentine troops never reached their remote location in St Andrew’s Bay, the pair were cut off for almost a month until being rescued by a helicopter from HMS Endurance. Cindy and Annie, who had flown a union jack on a makeshift flagpole at their camp, found a heroes’ welcome awaiting them when they returned to the UK. Their adventures were featured alongside the wildlife in a one-hour film Stranded on South Georgia and they subsequently recounted their experiences in a book Survival: South Atlantic. The programme was re-titled King Penguin: Stranded Beyond the Falklands in the US where it was narrated by Orson Welles and received an Emmy Award nomination in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to appreciate and admire {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> buildings that the world has ever seen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, stop {{where you}} are," [...] said the skipper. [...] "I can stand it better by daylight. It’s the <b>most</b> {{wonderful}} and <b>extraordinary</b> thing I’ve ever seen. Do {{you mean to}} say you can’t see anything, Sam?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{acknowledgements}} for the book, Symons says: [...] "For {{the past}} twenty years, I've been collecting weird and wonderful facts, which I've been storing on bits of paper and, more recently, on my computer. Every few years I'll use some {{of it in a}} book or a newspaper series, but it's always been my ambition {{to be able to put}} together the <b>most</b> fascinating, <b>extraordinary</b> facts I had-or could find-in one volume." ...|$|R
50|$|Mr. Francis Talents, {{an ancient}} Fellow of Magdalen Colledge in Cambridge, {{and a good}} Schollar, a godly, blameless Divine, <b>most</b> eminent for <b>extraordinary</b> Prudence, and moderation, and peaceableness towards all, who in our Wars lived at Saumours in France and is now there again.|$|R

500|$|The {{historian}} Lizanne Henderson {{described the}} events surrounding {{the case of the}} Pittenweem witches as [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and truly horrific outbursts of witch persecution". It was the last significant spate of witch hunting in Fife.|$|E
500|$|Grant and Sumner {{were often}} {{at odds with}} each other on matters of foreign policy and {{political}} patronage. Sumner followed his own foreign policy and detested Grant's practice of nepotism in making political appointments. [...] Historian, Mary L. Hinsdale, described the Grant Administration as [...] "a <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> array of departures from the normal course" [...] and a [...] "military" [...] rule, in close connection with a select Republican Senatorial group." ...|$|E
50|$|The highest {{award of}} the Royal Astronomical Society is its Gold Medal, {{which can be}} awarded for any purpose but <b>most</b> {{frequently}} recognises <b>extraordinary</b> lifetime achievement. Among the recipients best known {{to the general public}} are Albert Einstein in 1926, and Stephen Hawking in 1985.|$|R
60|$|No sooner did the one eye of {{the little}} gentleman in black light upon the object than a <b>most</b> {{singular}} and <b>extraordinary</b> convulsion appeared to seize upon him.

5000|$|In 1872, the Shah {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Baron Julius de Reuter, which George Nathaniel Curzon (who {{was one of the greatest}} statesmen of his day) called [...] "The <b>most</b> complete and <b>extraordinary</b> surrender of the entire industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has ever been dreamed of".|$|R
