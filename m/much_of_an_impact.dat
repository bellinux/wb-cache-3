Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact.</b> While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact.</b> One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E

Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, with the chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar confirming Yuvraj was fit.

25|$|In August, the Ottoman military, {{led by the}} Army of Islam, {{launched}} a new assault against the frontline positions, which were primarily manned by Armenians.

In the first week of September, a joint Ottoman-Azerbaijani force composed of 15,000 men advanced without much resistance toward Baku and by September 13, had reached the suburbs of the city; meanwhile, Baku's Muslim population prepared to welcome the entry of the Ottoman army. The remaining Armenian troops were too ill-prepared to halt the advance and Dunsterville refused to retain his force any longer.

25|$|The {{population}} of Minas Gerais {{is the result}} of an intense mixture of peoples, particularly between Black Africans and Portuguese. In colonial Minas Gerais, the population was divided in five different categories: Whites, mostly Portuguese; Africans, who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin (for example Francisca Benguela would refer to Benguela); Crioulos (Black people born in Brazil, usually to both African parents); Mulattoes (people of mixed Black and White ancestry, usually born to a Black mother and a Portuguese father) and Cabras (people of mixed ancestry, usually with high degree of Amerindian admixture). Blacks and Mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization. By the 19th century, however, whites were already the largest single group in the Minas Gerais population. Taking the population as a whole (all groups included), European genes account {{for the majority of the}} Minas Gerais genetic heritage, which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved African population and lower reproductive rate of African slaves (the vast majority of them were males, among other reasons for their lower reproductive success) The Amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the European colonists and they did not have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> either, especially in Minas Gerais, where European presence and colonization was massive.|$|E
25|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Maynard {{was brought}} up {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales where he first joined Glamorgan. His career started in fine fashion when he hit a century on his debut in 1985, hitting three {{consecutive}} sixes to reach the 100 and he became the youngest-ever player to score 1,000 runs for the country in 1986. The 54 centuries he scored for Glamorgan during his playing career is also a record - the most any player has scored for the club. These displays of skill did not go unnoticed by the England selectors and he earned a call-up against the West Indies at the Oval in 1988. He was picked again in 1989 but then ran foul of the cricketing authorities by agreeing to go with Mike Gatting, on the controversial rebel tour of South Africa when that country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid. He later justified his decision by saying that he was desperate for a taste of international cricket having just been dropped from the England team. Nevertheless, his conduct led to a three-year Test ban, but he was eventually granted a recall for the Ashes series in 1993 after he had hit a century for Glamorgan against the Australians, but he failed to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> with the bat.|$|E
25|$|Mascis took Cosloy up on {{his offer}} to release an album and Dinosaur {{recorded}} their debut album for $500 at a home studio in the woods outside Northampton, Massachusetts. Their debut album, Dinosaur, was released in 1985. The music was extremely eclectic and revealed a combination of musical styles that was very unusual, especially for the mid-1980s: the speed of hardcore punk, Crazy Horse-style garage rock, slower and monolithic Black Sabbath-style metal riffs, folk rock, twangy country-rock and the dour moods of gothic music. On the band's later albums, these elements would often be combined into single songs, but on the debut album, each individual song is different stylistically. All of this was delivered with the extreme level of volume and distortion that would {{become part of the}} band's signature style. Mascis wrote all of the songs. Some of the singing was done by Mascis in his trademark nasal drawl (often compared to singer Neil Young), but the majority of the lead vocals were by Lou Barlow. Mascis would sing most or all of the lead vocals on all of their subsequent releases. The album did not make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> commercially or critically: it sold only about 1,500 copies in its first year and was largely ignored by the majority of the music press.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aggregate <b>impact,</b> Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|R
