50|$|The {{steaming}} function {{works very}} well for foods like vegetables, potatoes and fish, while convection or combination (convection plus steam) heat is suitable for roasting, braising and baking. One disadvantage of convection heat is that foods tend to dry out more quickly; depending on the product, it may also require very long cooking times. Meanwhile, steaming alone does not get foods crispy enough. Combining convection and steam heat utilizes the advantages provided by each cooking method, yielding tender meat with a crisp outer crust. Users also have complete control over the cooking environment, as the devices allow <b>manual</b> <b>regulation</b> of both temperature and humidity within the cooking chamber.|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{influence}} {{of change in}} quality of superheated steam temperature regulations on service life of super-heater metal. А dependence between metal service life and dispersion value for different steel grades has been determined in the paper. Numerical values pertaining to increase of super-heater metal service life in case of transferring from <b>manual</b> <b>regulation</b> to standard system of automatic regulation (SAR) have been determined and in case of transferring from standard SAR to improved SAR.

40|$|A {{multiple}} model adaptive predictive controller {{is designed}} to regulate mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in critical care subjects using inotropic and vasoactive drugs. The algorithm uses a multiple model adaptive approach in a model predictive control framework to account for inter- and intra-patient variability and explicitly handle drug rate constraints. The controller is evaluated on canines that were pharmacologically altered to exhibit symptoms of hypertension and depressed cardiac output. I. INTRODUCTION Critical care physicians maintain certain patient state variables within acceptable operating ranges by infusing several drugs and/or intravenous fluids. Constant monitoring and <b>manual</b> <b>regulation</b> of the physiological variables can be tedious. Hence, it is desirable to have an automated system to perform such tasks.

The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was registered every 10 and 30 sec during the first 150 min after open heart surgery in 20 patients (group 1 : computer regulation) and in ten patients (group 2 : <b>manual</b> <b>regulation).</b> The results (16, 343 and 2, 912 data points in groups 1 and 2, respectively), were then analyzed in four time frames and five pressure ranges to indicate clinical efficacy.

To realize topology discovery on tactical internet which own special architecture and communication model because of the router-switch which was the unique key equipment of tactical internet made by special institute, a distributed topology discovery method was proposed based on Agent. It depended on cooperation of two topology discoveries: topology discovery in management domain and topology discovery in whole network.

40|$|Abstract The present paper {{described}} the latency {{and accuracy of}} compensatory response of finger grip force during a <b>manual</b> <b>regulation</b> of tone pitch as a basic study for behavioral and neuroscientific researches on the auditory-motor integration. In the experiment, the task of subject was to regulate the fundamental frequency (F 0) of tone by his/her {{thumb and index finger}} pressing a force sensor. The F 0 was 523. 25 Hz（C 5 ）when the measured force was 5 N, and was changed 100 cents up if the force increased 1 N. While the subject regulated and kept a target F 0 at 466. 16 ， 523. 25 or 587. 33 Hz (Bb 4 ， C 5 or D 5), the tone F 0 was unexpectedly shifted upward or downward by 100 cents. The compensatory change of finger force for the F 0 shifts was measured. As results, the compensatory response with latency of 150 ~ 300 ms was observed. The latency was gradually reduced from 283. 8 to 208. 8 ms in the shift-up condition and 288. 6 to 163. 1 ms in the shift-down condition during the experiment lasting about ninety minutes. The F 0 error of the compensatory response was also reduced from 47. 9 to 32. 6 cents and from 44. 1 to 23. 9 cents, respectively, with progression of sessions. The observed latency approximately corresponded to the latency of the voluntary response observed in the vocal F 0 control, but not to that of th...|$|E

5000|$|As a commander, Harmar was a stern martinet who {{was much}} {{influenced}} by Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben's <b>manual</b> <b>Regulations</b> for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, {{better known as}} the Blue Book for the Prussian-style training of American troops. The American historian William Guthman noted: [...] "Steuben's manual was aimed at combatting British and Hessian forces - not the backwoods guerilla fighting of the highly skilled American Indian warriors the regiment would eventually fight. Short-sightedness {{on the part of the}} military was the reason that no preparatory training in guerrilla warfare was ever imposed on the Army... no federal unit under Harmar or St. Clair was ever instructed in the frontiersmen's method of war". Harmar doggedly insisted on Prussian-style training designed for the clash of regular forces in Central Europe, not the frontier style of irregular warfare in the forests of the Old Northwest that his men required. The former Prussian officer Steuben held only a divisional command in the Continental Army, but as the chief trainer of the Continental Army, he had introduced Prussian drill and discipline into the American Army, and thanks to Steuben's training, the Continental Army became a formidable force. It is very unlikely that the Continental Army would have won the Revolutionary War without Steuben's training, and as a result, Steuben was greatly admired by many American officers. One of those officers was Harmar, who at the time of his death in 1813, was still insisting to anyone who would listen that all that was needed for victory was to follow the precepts laid down in Steuben's Blue Book.|$|R
40|$|Professor Kenneth Davis {{has long}} {{advocated}} that police manuals {{should be viewed}} as interpretative administrative rules, which would guide police in their daily activities. He argued that police departments should not fear adopting interpretative rules because such rules would not be binding; therefore, the department would not be subject to tort liability if an officer violated such a rule. In Peterson v. City of Long Beach, a police officer violated the police manual when he shot and killed a non-violent fleeing suspect. The California Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Frank Newman, cited Professor Davis and his call for police administrative rulemaking. Justice Newman, however, ignored Davis 2 ̆ 7 s view that the manual represented nonbinding interpretative rules. Instead, Newman held that the police <b>manual</b> is a <b>regulation</b> of a public entity and the violation of its rules by a police officer carries a rebuttable presumption of negligence. The result of Peterson is that police departments in California are now subject to tort liability when an officer violates the provisions of the department 2 ̆ 7 s own manual. Justice Newman had an opportunity to incorporate Davis 2 ̆ 7 s view and introduce California police departments to administrative rulemaking.
