25|$|Cloud {{computing}} addresses {{two major}} ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and resource consumption. Virtualization, Dynamic provisioning environment, <b>multi-tenancy,</b> green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up {{to a great}} extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud. One common example includes Online shopping that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel {{to reach out to}} the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.|$|E
500|$|Windows Server 2012, {{along with}} Windows 8, {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Hyper-V, as presented at the Microsoft BUILD event. Many new features have been added to Hyper-V, including network virtualization, <b>multi-tenancy,</b> storage resource pools, cross-premises connectivity, and cloud backup. Additionally, many of the former restrictions on resource consumption have been greatly lifted. Each virtual machine in this version of Hyper-V can access up to 64 virtual processors, up to 1 terabyte of memory, and up to 64 terabytes of virtual disk space per virtual hard disk (using a new [...]vhdx format). Up to 1024 virtual machines can be active per host, and up to 8000 can be active per failover cluster. SLAT is a required processor feature for Hyper-V on Windows 8, while for Windows Server 2012 it is only required for the supplementary RemoteFX role.|$|E

50|$|Use {{of native}} <b>multi-tenancy</b> is the {{preferred}} method for high-performance database computing with Clusterpoint software vs operating system level virtualization or software containerization for safe <b>multi-tenancy.</b> OS-level virtualization may decrease available network bandwidth and computing resource, creating also unexpected bottlenecks at storage I/O level, {{that could result in}} increased application latencies. Database virtualization can be best use for prototyping and development where operational performance guarantees and low latency are not the first priority.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, in {{contrast}} to the <b>multi-tenancy</b> approaches to SaaS, a virtual appliance can also be deployed on-premises for customers that need local network access to the running application, or have security requirements that a third-party hosting model does not meet. The underlying virtualization technology also allows for rapid movement of virtual appliances instances between physical execution environments. Traditional approaches to SaaS fix the application in place on the hosted infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|Since 2008, Jack Li {{and other}} {{developers}} at AthenaSource have been developing {{quite a number}} of cloud SaaS applications for their clients. Initially, they tried many popular frameworks but gave up all of them due to performance issues and painful configurations. Naturally, they started to build a new framework that supports <b>multi-tenancy</b> natively. This was version 1.0 of Athena Framework. This framework was released open source under the LGPL license in Mar 2011.|$|E
5000|$|MaaS360 was {{originally}} {{started with a}} cloud option or an on-premise solution. Since IBM MaaS 360 is uses a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. The software is residing on IBM's Bluemix cloud platform. It has <b>multi-tenancy</b> allowing {{for all types of}} businesses and organizations to use the software from their web based login portal. MaaS 260 has a [...] "cloud" [...] extender plugin allowing a corporate Active Directory server to integrate all of a user's normal login credentials.|$|E
50|$|Athena Framework is an {{enterprise}} object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that employs metadata as mapping configuration. It simplifies Java web application development {{by removing the}} requirement of manual mapping and manual database schema updating. In addition to features like Java object persistence, powerful EJBQL querying execution and comprehensive code generation, Athena has built-in support for <b>multi-tenancy</b> which enables developers to build cloud applications easily. Athena can be easily integrated with other libraries like Struts or Spring to provide full stacks of service.|$|E
50|$|The ASP {{model is}} often {{compared}} with Software as a Service (SaaS), {{but while the}} latter typically delivers a generic service at scale to many users, the former typically involved delivering a service to {{a small number of}} users (often using separate single-tenant instances). This meant that the many benefits of <b>multi-tenancy</b> (cost sharing, economies of scale, etc.) were not accessible to ASP providers, and their services were more comparable to in-house hosting than to true multi-tenant SaaS solutions like Salesforce.com.|$|E
