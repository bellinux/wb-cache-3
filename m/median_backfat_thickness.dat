40|$|The work {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> change, during sow´s lactation, on their subsequent litter characteristics. The reproduction potential of 478 sows of two genotypes was assessed. The genotypes were 50 Large White (LWD) sows and 428 crossbreeds Large White x Landrace (LWD x L) sows. The <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> decline was examined in accordance to P 2, <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> in sows during lactation namely 1 day before planned parturition as well as weaning. From the obtained results it can be stated that the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> decline level during lactation has a small influence on the number of total born piglets. In contrast, the number of piglets born alive increased when <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> rate increased. With a moderate <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> decline, the average birthweight piglets gradually increased. However, the opposite trend was shown for the average weight at weaning. The <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> decline level during sow´s lactation influences their farrowing interval. Animals with a lower increase of the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> subsequently showed a shorter farrowing interval (148. 99, respectively 151. 86 days), as well as a shorter weaning – estrus interval...|$|R

40|$|Background: Meat quality {{involves}} many traits, such as marbling, tenderness, juiciness, and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> all {{of which}} require attention from livestock producers. <b>Backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> improvement by means of traditional selection techniques in Canchim beef cattle has been challenging due to its low heritability, and it is measured late in an animal?s life. Therefore, the implementation of new methodologies for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> are an important strategy for genetic improvement of carcass and meat quality. Results: The set of SNPs identified by the random forest approach explained as much as 50 % of the deregressed estimated breeding value (dEBV) variance associated with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> and a small set of 5 SNPs were able to explain 34 % of the dEBV for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness.</b> Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fat-related traits {{were found in the}} surrounding areas of the SNPs, as well as many genes with roles in lipid metabolism. Conclusions: These results provided {{a better understanding of the}} backfat deposition and regulation pathways, and can be considered a starting point for future implementation of a genomic selection program for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> in Canchim beef cattle. 201...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of pork carcass <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> on the dissection efficiency of four primal cuts (ham, loin, shoulder, belly), including correlation coefficients. The research material consisted of 80 pork carcasses. <b>Backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> (mm) was measured on cold half-carcasses using a vernier caliper at 6 points: at the first cervical vertebra (atlas), over shoulder at the thickest point, on the back, at the beginning, center, end of the gluteus medius muscle (CI, CII, CIII). On the basis of the average <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> measurements from 6 points were separated into two experimental groups: I (< 25 mm); II (≥ 25 mm). Detailed dissection of the elements was performed to define mass (g) : total, intermuscular fat, bones and lean meat. The significant effect of fat thickness on intermuscular fat content regardless of the cut was noted. Correlations between the average <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> of 6 points and the total weight of the four main elements were calculated. In addition, the correlation coefficients were compared between the dissection elements and the average <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> of 6 and 5 points. Higher <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> determined the increase in the total mass of loin, shoulder and belly. A statistically proven correlation was shown between the average <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> and the total mass of the analysed elements (r= 0. 293). When comparing the correlation coefficients of a different number of measurements a specific tendency was observed. Positive correlation coefficients were slightly higher for an average of 5 points of <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> and negative correlation coefficients were slightly higher for an average of 6 points. Statistical differences between groups were recorded at the same level for the same parameters (P≤ 0. 001 and 0. 01 <P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} delta {{belongs to}} the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. It is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene (PPARD) has been assigned to a region on porcine chromosome 7, which harbours a quantitative trait locus for backfat. Thus, PPARD is considered a functional and positional candidate gene for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to test this candidate gene hypothesis in a cross of breeds that were highly divergent in lipid deposition characteristics. Results Screening for genetic variation in porcine PPARD revealed only silent mutations. Nevertheless, significant associations between PPARD haplotypes and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> were observed in the F 2 generation of the Mangalitsa × Piétrain cross as well as a commercial German Landrace population. Haplotype 5 is associated with increased backfat in F 2 Mangalitsa × Piétrain pigs, whereas haplotype 4 is associated with lower <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> in the German Landrace population. Haplotype 4 and 5 carry the same alleles at all but one SNP. Interestingly, the opposite effects of PPARD haplotypes 4 and 5 on <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> are reflected by opposite effects of these two haplotypes on PPAR-δ mRNA levels. Haplotype 4 significantly increases PPAR-δ mRNA levels, whereas haplotype 5 decreases mRNA levels of PPAR-δ. Conclusion This study provides evidence for an association between PPARD and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness.</b> The association is substantiated by mRNA quantification. Further studies are required to clarify, whether the observed associations are caused by PPARD or are the result of linkage disequilibrium with a causal variant in a neighbouring gene. </p...|$|R

Analysis was performed in six discrete and overlapping generations on <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> loin eye area and litter size (number born alive and dead); litter size was the primary trait of emphasis in the selection scheme. Phenotypic correlations adjusted for different environmental effects were estimated along with heritability for the traits considered. Phenotypic correlation between <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> and loin eye area was moderate and showed a negative trend in both parental and Composite populations. Correlations between litter size and loin eye area or <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> were not consistent; litter size had, where significant, a moderate negative association with loin eye area.

Association analyses were performed using a statistical model that included genotype, sex, and batch as fixed effects, sire and error as random effects. The T 2411 C SNP was associated with skinless and fatless boston shoulder weight (BSW), <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> at last rib, 6. 5 cm from the midline (P 2), skinless and fatless picnic shoulder weight, and sirloin weight (SLW). The T 3266 G mutation was associated with slaughter age, bacon weight, BSW, midline <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> between last and last but one lumbar vertebra, midline <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> at last rib, P 2 and rib weight. Phenotypic associations were also performed by combining genotypes for both SNPs. Associations with P 2, carcass yield, total boston shoulder weight, and SLW were observed. The results obtained demonstrate that the SNPs analyzed have potential to be explored as markers for carcass composition in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{ultrasound}} data of <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> longissimus thoracis muscle depth and longissimus thoracis muscle area {{were obtained from}} 210 Piétrain pigs (98 gilts and 112 barrows) using the Pie Medical Scanner 200 equipped with an animal science probe (ASP- 18) and frequency of 3. 5 MHz. They were fed ad libitum and slaughtered at {{an average age of}} 213 days for an average weight of 101 kg. The day before slaughter, four longitudinal and transverse images were taken on the level of the last rib and the tenth rib from each animal. The repeatability of ultrasound last rib backfat (ULRBF) measurements was similar to that of tenth rib backfat (UTRBF) (t = 0. 87). Ultrasound last rib longissimus thoracis muscle depth (ULRMD) and area (ULRMA) measurements were more repeatable than those corresponding to the tenth rib. The best correlation between carcass lean percentage estimated by the Fat Lean Meter (CGM lean) and ultrasound carcass measurements was obtained with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> (r = - 0. 51). The correlation between CGM lean percentage and ULRMD and between CGM lean percentage and ULRMA were higher than those between CGM lean percentage and UTRMD and between CGM lean percentage and UTRMArespectively. When the CGM lean percentage was predicted from ultrasound <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the accuracy of the regression equation was the same regardless of the probing site (last or tenth rib). On the other hand, when longissimus thoracis muscle measurements (depth and area) are included together with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> in prediction equations, the last rib was more accuracy. Therefore, the last rib site can serve as the probing site for CGM lean percentage prediction...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the PIT 1 gene in several pig populations and the chromosomal region near PIT 1 in some pig populations has been significantly associated with fatness and growth on pig chromosome 13. To confirm these previous results and to clarify the role of the PIT 1 gene in controlling pig fatness and growth, this research project was focused on studying the chromosomal region close to the PIT 1 gene. The ISU Chinese x U. S. pig families were used and the traits analyzed were birth weight, 21 -day weight, 42 -day weight, longissimus muscle area, <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> at several locations, meat color, marbling and firmness on the carcass, and growth rate for selected time periods. The total number of F 2 pigs used ranged from 241 to 330. Significant evidence of a genetic marker for first rib <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> was detected approximately 20 centimorgans (cM) from the PIT 1 gene. Evidence of a genetic marker for birth weight was detected at the estimated PIT 1 position. These results confirmed the previous published research on pig chromosome 13 for the birth weight but suggest that other genes in the region may be partly responsible for the earlier results on the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|R
40|$|In an {{experimental}} cross between Meishan and Dutch Large White and Landrace lines, 619 F(2) animals {{and their parents}} were typed for molecular markers covering the entire porcine genome. Associations were studied between these markers and two fatness traits: intramuscular fat content and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness.</b> Association analyses were performed using interval mapping by regression under two genetic models: (1) an outbred line-cross model where the founder lines were assumed to be fixed for different QTL alleles; and (2) a half-sib model where a unique allele substitution effect was fitted {{within each of the}} 19 half-sib families. Both approaches revealed for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> a highly significant QTL on chromosome 7 and suggestive evidence for a QTL at chromosome 2. Furthermore, suggestive QTL affecting <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> were detected on chromosomes 1 and 6 under the line-cross model. For intramuscular fat content the line-cross approach showed suggestive evidence for QTL on chromosomes 2, 4, and 6, whereas the half-sib analysis showed suggestive linkage for chromosomes 4 and 7. The nature of the QTL effects and assumptions underlying both models could explain discrepancies between the findings under the two models.

Among the 596 animals analyzed, 493 (82. 72 %) were characterized as NN and 103 (17. 28 %) as Nn. With respect to carcass traits, Nn animals presented higher (p < 0. 05) right half carcass weight, left half carcass weight, loin depth and loin eye area, and lower shoulder <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> between last and next to last but one lumbar vertebrae and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> after last rib at 6. 5 cm from the midline compared to NN animals. Nn animals also showed (p < 0. 05) higher values {{for most of the}} cut yields, indicating higher cutting yields for animals carrying the n allele and lower values for bacon depth, confirming lower fat deposition in carcass. In addition, Nn animals presented (p < 0. 05) lower values for the performance trait weight at 105 days of age. These results indicate that animals carrying the PSS gene generate leaner carcasses, higher cut yields, and that the effects of the gene can be observed even in divergent crosses...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the semen quality of Pietrain boars originating from Belgian AI centers and to correlate these results with their meat quality traits. Freshly diluted semen doses from 140 boars originating from 10 artificial insemination (AI) centers were used and stored for five days at 17 degrees C. Motility was assessed daily using a computer assisted semen analyzer (Hamilton-Thorne), while morphology and concentration were assessed on the day of semen collection (Day 0) by eosin-nigrosin staining and the Burker counting chamber, respectively. These data were correlated with the lean meat percentage, loin eye depth and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> using linear mixed models taking into account the clustering of boars within each AI center and the daily measurements for each semen dose. The mean values (+/- SD) on Day 0 were: motility 79. 7 +/- 8. 2 %, live sperm 91. 5 +/- 4. 3 %, live normal sperm 83. 6 +/- 7. 4 %, and concentration 29. 0 +/- 10. 6 (x 10 (6) sperm/mL). The average five-day motility across all AI centers was 77. 7 +/- 8. 9 %. None of the assessed semen quality traits were associated with lean meat percentage. Motility and progressive motility on Day 0 were positively associated with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> (P < 0. 05), while no overall negative associations were elucidated between the latter semen quality traits and loin eye depth. The percentages of live and normal live sperm were not correlated with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> nor loin eye depth. To conclude, selection of terminal Belgian Pietrain boars for reduced <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> might negatively influence semen motility, whereas selection for increased lean meat percentage and loin eye depth would not necessarily compromise semen quality traits...|$|R
40|$|Data (n = 1, 746) {{collected}} from 1985 through 1995 on Korean Native Cattle by the National Livestock Research Institute of Korea {{were used to}} estimate genetic parameters for marbling score, dressing percentage, and longissimus muscle area, with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> slaughter age, or slaughter weight as covariates. Estimates were obtained with REML. Model 1 included animal genetic and residual random effects. Model 2 was extended to include an uncorrelated random effect of the dam. Model 3 was based on Model 1 but also included sire × region × year-season interaction effects. Model 4 combined Models 2 and 3. All models included fixed effects for region × year-season and age of dam × sex combinations. From single-trait analyses, estimates of heritability with covariates to adjust for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> slaughter age, and slaughter weight from Model 4 were, respectively,. 10,. 08, and. 01 for marbling score;. 09,. 12, and. 16 for dressing percentage; and. 18,. 17, and. 24 for longissimus muscle area. From three-trait analyses, estimates of genetic correlations between marbling score and dressing percentage, marbling score and longissimus muscle area, and dressing percentage and longissimus muscle area were, respec-tively, −. 99,. 20, and −. 11 with <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> as covariate; −. 88,. 47, and. 01 with slaughter age as covariate; and −. 03,. 39, and. 91 with slaughter weight as covariate. Results {{of this study suggest}} that choice of covariate (<b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> slaughter age, or slaughter weight) for the model seems to be important for carcass traits for Korean Native Cattle. Including sire × region × year-season interaction effects in the model for marbling score and dressing percentage may be important because whether sire × region × year-season interaction effects were in the model affected estimates of other variance components for the three carcass traits. Whether the maternal effect was in the model had little effect on estimates of other parameters. With <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> and slaughter age end points, selection for increasing marbling score would be expected to result in decreasing dressing percentage for Korean Native Cattle. With slaughter weight as a covariate for end point, increased longissimus muscle area would be associated with increased dressing percentage, and increased marbling score would be related to increased longissimus muscle area. The differences in estimates associated with choice of end point, however, need further study...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the evidence of post-parturient disorders and backfat loss during lactation in sows raised in tropical areas in relation to their <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> before farrowing and postpartum intravenous supportive treatment. <b>Backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured using A-mode ultrasonography at farrowing and weaning (25. 5 ± 1. 4 d) in 70 sows. The sows were divided into three groups according to <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> before farrowing, i. e., 15. 0 to 20. 0 mm (n = 21), 20. 5 to 25. 0 mm (n = 35), > 25. 0 mm (n = 14) and were categorized into two groups according to the postpartum supportive treatment, i. e., control (n = 31) and treatment (n = 39). After farrowing, the sows in treatment group received the same medications as in control sows. Furthermore an intravenous supportive treatment with amino acids and vitamins was administered in treatment groups. Rectal temperature and clinical signs of the sows including vaginal discharge, udder problems and appetite were determined at d 0, 1, 2 and 3 of parturition. It was found that, on average, the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> was 22. 4 ± 3. 9 mm at farrowing and 19. 9 ± 2. 9 mm at weaning. The backfat loss and the relative backfat loss during the lactation period were 2. 6 mm and 10. 6 %, respectively. The sows with a backfat of 15. 0 to 20. 0 mm before farrowing lost less backfat than those with a backfat of 20. 5 to 25. 0 mm and > 25. 0 mm (p 10 % during lactation were higher in sows with a backfat of > 25. 0 mm before farrowing (85. 7 %) than sows with a backfat of 15. 0 to 20. 0 mm before farrowing (35. 0 %) (p = 0. 008). The percentage of sows with a reduced appetite on d 1 (90. 3 % vs 71. 8 %, p = 0. 018) and d 2 (61. 3 % versus 33. 3 %, p = 0. 005) postpartum in the treatment group was lower than the control group. In conclusion, the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> of sows at farrowing influenced backfat loss during lactation under hot and humid climates.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 588 pigs {{representing}} six genetic lines {{were included in}} this study. These lines were selected to represent {{a wide range of}} biological types for appetite, rate and composition of gain, and meat quality traits. Each line was fed four different diets differing in lysine content. Barrows and gilts were used in the experiment, and pigs were randomly assigned to come off test at one of three weights (113. 6, 131. 8, or 150 kg). Rates of increase in weight, <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> and longissimus muscle area were essentially linear. Genetic type and diet influenced (P 3 ̆c. 05) rates of change in weight, <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness,</b> and longissimus muscle area and 10 th rib fat depth, carcass longissimus muscle area, and dressing percentage. Genetic type × diet interactions were significant for weight change and 10 th rib fat. As off-test-weight class increased fat and longissimus muscle area increased in linear fashion. In general, interactions associated with diet resulted from feeding the diet lowest in lysine. There was little evidence of genetic type × diet interactions. If those interactions that tested significant are real, they are a result of extremes in both genetic type (high fatness) and lysine level (low). Slaughtering pigs at heavier weights results in no change in rate of gain over the feeding period and linear increases in longissimus muscle area and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Beef quality {{measurement}} is {{a complex}} task with high economic impact. There is high interest in obtaining an automatic quality parameters estimation in live cattle or post mortem. In this paper {{we set out to}} obtain beef quality estimates from the analysis of ultrasound (in vivo) and color images (post mortem), with the measurement of various parameters related to tenderness and amount of meat: rib eye area, percentage of intramuscular fat and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> or subcutaneous fat. Proposal: An algorithm based on curve evolution is implemented to calculate the rib eye area. The <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> is estimated from the profile of distances between two curves that limit the steak and the rib eye, previously detected. A model base in Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained to estimate the intramuscular fat percentage. A series of features extracted on a region of interest, previously detected in both ultrasound and color images, were proposed. In all cases, a complete evaluation was performed with different databases including: color and ultrasound images acquired by a beef industry expert, intramuscular fat estimation obtained by an expert using a commercial software, and chemical analysis. Conclusions: The proposed algorithms show good results to calculate the rib eye area and the <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> measure and profile.

40|$|<b>Backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> {{is a good}} {{predictor}} of carcass lean content, an economically important trait, and a main breeding target in pig improvement. In this study, the candidate genes and genomic regions associated with the tenth rib <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> trait were identified in two independent pig populations, using a genome-wide association study of porcine 60 K SNP genotype data applying the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) statistical method. For each population, 30 most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and SNP annotation implemented using Sus scrofa Build 10. 2. In the first population, 25 significant SNPs were distributed on seven chromosomes, and SNPs on SSC 1 and SSC 7 showed great significance for fat deposition. The most significant SNP (ALGA 0006623) was located on SSC 1, upstream of the MC 4 R gene. In the second population, 27 significant SNPs were recognized by annotation, and 12 SNPs on SSC 12 were related to fat deposition. Two haplotype blocks, M 1 GA 0016251 -MARC 0075799 and ALGA 0065251 -MARC 0014203 -M 1 GA 0016298 -ALGA 0065308, were detected in significant regions where the PIPNC 1 and GH 1 genes were identified as contributing to fat metabolism.

40|$|Title of the paper: Body {{condition}} and metabolic stability as basis of high milk yield, reproductive performance, and general health in dairy cows The target {{of this study}} was to describe the interactions between body {{condition and}} various descriptors of yield and fertility. It was aimed to identify an optimal conditional range to be used in herd management which combines high milk yield with acceptable fertility traits and general health. For this purpose, <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured by ultrasound at 46111 dairy cows on 78 different farms and was subsequently related to production variables. Negative energy balance is getting more intense and prolonged with increasing milk yield. However a conditional nadir below 10 mm leads to decreased milk production. To reach a high production level without an increasing incidence of health disorders, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> on herd average. Lower value only lead to negligibly higher milk yield but cause a distinctively higher risk of fertility problems and culling. High herd yields do not have to be at expense of reproduction performance and can be achieved without extreme body condition losses. An efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility, which commonly is combined with increasing milk yield. It is suggested a standard curve for <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> throughout lactation to be used in dairy herd management...|$|R

In experiment I, Landrace gilts were fed ad libitum, from 10 weeks of age to puberty, diets containing either 2800 (LE), 3400 (ME) and 3900 (HE) Kcal DE/kg. Age at puberty was delayed in gilts fed LE and ME. <b>Backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> was significantly reduced in LE and ME groups. Puberty onset was more determined by age and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> than by weight. In experiment II, all gilts that had shown normal heat within 240 days of age, were inseminated on the second estrus and given the same diet as received during their growing period. Feed was restricted to 2. 0 kg per day during gestation and was provided ad libitum in lactation. Gilts in LE and ME gained less weight and backfat during gestation than gilts in HE group. Gilts gaining more weight and backfat during gestation, with a resulting higher body weight and <b>backfat</b> <b>thickness</b> at parturition, lost more in lactation. Incidence of anoestrus after weaning was higher in the LE and HE groups. In experiment III, multiparous Landrace-Yorkshire sows from two herds were used. An extended weaning to remating interval and reduced number of piglets weaned was observed in first and second parity sows. Lower reproductive performance in one herd was related to an excessive loss of backfat in lactation and a low backfat level at weaning...|$|R
