500|$|The Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust, {{established}} by Meher Baba in 1959, maintains his tomb and pilgrimage facilities, {{as well as}} a free school and dispensary, a cataract clinic, and a veterinary clinic. The Trust follows the charter left for it by Meher Baba in his lifetime, but does not act as spiritual authority over groups. Likewise, the Trust does not engage in propaganda, promote creeds or dogmas, or seek converts. Baba discouraged evangelizing, stating, [...] "I need no propaganda or publicity." [...] Rather, he encouraged his followers to [...] "let your life itself be <b>my</b> <b>message</b> of love and truth to others" [...] and to [...] "spread <b>my</b> <b>message</b> of Love and Truth as far and wide as possible". Followers of Meher Baba have no established rituals. Many do, however, perform practices of choice such as pujas, aartis, prayers, music, plays, viewing films of Baba and so forth, but the choice is personal. The primary focus for followers is living a life Meher Baba would approve of, for example, refraining from the use of psychedelic drugs, including marijuana, and trying to remember God with love.|$|E
500|$|... "Paper or Plastic" [...] is a two-minute, fifty-five second pop song, which {{features}} a [...] "mid-tempo groove". Unlike her previous material from her 2014 EP Opulence, Candy does not rap during the song and instead sings the verses. Mike Wass of Idolator felt that Candy was making a conscious move away from [...] "the twisted white-girl rap" [...] present in her past songs [...] "Opulence" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Fuck Right Now". Wass also called the track [...] "unusually restrained" [...] for the artist. According to Nylon's Yasmeen Gharnit, [...] "Paper or Plastic" [...] revolves around issues relating to [...] "commercialism, superficiality, and selling out". A writer from Hungertv.com viewed the song as focusing on [...] "the capitalist agenda and societal exclusion". When responding to criticism regarding her change in musical style, Candy said: [...] "hatever I have to do [...] garner a larger, broader audience to spread <b>my</b> <b>message</b> on a larger scale, I stand for women, I stand for freedom. For love and self-preservation." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be as big a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and <b>my</b> <b>message.</b> We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish {{a little girl in}} the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was <b>my</b> <b>message</b> in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance." [...] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolises [...] "innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{the following day}} with The Times, Megrahi vowed to present new evidence before he died which would exonerate him of any involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.

There was a miscarriage of justice ... <b>my</b> <b>message</b> to the British and Scottish communities is that I will put out the evidence {{and ask them to}} be the jury".|$|E

2500|$|After Action Reports of {{the patrol}} {{were met with}} {{positive}} reviews, General Abrams formally approved the operation. The success of the operation was more valuable than just {{the destruction of the}} enemy, because it allowed Colonel Barrow to request that continued operations in Laos be approved. His reasoning for continued operations was the presence of the enemy in the area was a threat to his troops. Barrow noted, [...] "I put a final comment on <b>my</b> <b>message,</b> which said, quote, [...] "Put another way, my forces should not be here if ground interdiction of Route 922 not authorized." [...] The message finally reached General Abrams via General Stilwell, who had adopted the Colonel's recommendation.

2500|$|In a 1914 {{interview}} Weber declared: [...] "In {{moving pictures}} I have found my life's work. I find at once {{an outlet for}} my emotions and my ideals. I can preach to my heart's content, and {{with the opportunity to}} write the play, act the leading role, and direct the entire production, if <b>my</b> <b>message</b> fails to reach someone, I can blame only myself." [...] As many of Weber's films focused on a moral topic, she [...] "was often mistaken as a Christian fundamentalist, but she was more of a libertarian, opposing censorship and the death penalty and championing birth control. The need for a strong, loving and nurturing home was clearly promoted as well and if there was a single maxim that underlay each film it was that selfishness and egocentricity erode the individual and community".|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?"

However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey <b>my</b> <b>message</b> to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you think he will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E

2500|$|A further {{decision}} on sending more troops {{came after the}} administration completed a broader review of Afghanistan policy. On 27 March 2009, Obama announced after an intense 60-day White House policy review, in which military commanders and diplomats, regional governments, partners, Nato allies, NGOs and aid organisations were consulted, a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. [...] "So I want the American {{people to understand that}} we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That is the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, <b>my</b> <b>message</b> is the same: we will defeat you," [...] Obama said. For this purpose Obama announced that he plans to further bolster American forces in Afghanistan, increase aid to Pakistan, and set strict standards – like levels of violence and casualties in Afghanistan, Pakistani attacks against insurgents and accounting for U.S. aid – for measuring progress in fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban in both countries. Part of his strategy was the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops – beyond the additional 17,000 he authorized in February—to work as trainers and advisers to the Afghan army and police. The move was accompanied by a [...] "surge" [...] in US civilians to Afghanistan to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. In addition to the renewed focus on Afghanistan, the Obama administration was to step up pressure on Pakistan to tackle the al-Qaida and Taliban safe havens in the tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan. US military and civilian aid was to be increased. The last element of the policy was to try to engage Afghanistan's regional neighbours, including Russia and Iran, in helping to pacify Afghanistan.|$|E
