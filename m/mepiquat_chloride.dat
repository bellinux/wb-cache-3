40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe water stress tolerance in cotton seeds, when <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> is used as seed treatment. Increasing drought resistance of cotton seedlings by accelerating root growth is an important practical implication. The study was conducted on effects of <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> (1, 1 -dimetheyl peperidinum chloride) on drought resistance of cotton seedling. The cotton seeds were soaked for night in mepequat chloride solution i. e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ml L - 1. Water stress was given after thirty days after sowing, for nine days and data were collected for root length, shoot length, fresh weight and dry weight. Firstly, <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> seed treated plants were well irrigated and subjected to severe stress. It indicated that petiol length and shoot length decreased, while root length, fresh weight and dry weight increased with high concentration of <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride.</b> Cotton seeds treated with high dose of <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> may elongate the days taken to emerge first true leaves.

Plant height and number of total main stem nodes were different among row spacing and <b>Mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> application. The height was highest in plots where no application of <b>Mepiquat</b> <b>chloride.</b> Cotton grown in narrow row spacing (20 and 50 cm) had higher seed cotton yield than 75 cm row spacing, but reduce Ginning Out Turn (GOT) percentage in narrow row spacing negating any increase in seed cotton yield. In general reduced row spacing and <b>Mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> application did not lower fiber quality.

In an experiment carriedout in a greenhouse, soybean plants were cultivated (Glycine max (L.) Merrill cv.

It {{is expected that}} the closer the rainfall to spraying time, the higher the product loss and the higher the amount of product to be reapplied to reach the desired growth rate. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of time between rainfall and application of either <b>mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> or chlormequat chloride to cotton on plant growth, as well as, estimate the need for PGR reapplication. Cotton was grown in 12 -L pots with soil in a greenhouse. PGRs were applied forty days after seedling emergence, when 50 % of plants had one pinhead square. Rainfall was simulated 1, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h after spraying. Plant height was measured just before PGR application and then at 3 -d intervals for 30 d. At harvest, the number of reproductive branches and structures were counted before dry matter phytomass determination. Both growth regulators reduced cotton dry matter yields regardless of rainfall interval. PGRs controlled excessive plant growth; however, their efficiency was reduced as the time elapsed until rainfall was shorter. Product losses were detected after all rainfall intervals, which, in field conditions would require PGR reapplication. <b>Mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> rates to be reapplied after rain were on average 17 % higher than chlormequat chloride rates...|$|E

To maximize the utilization {{and distribution of}} nutrients in the crops, plant growth regulator (PGR) is needed to optimize the cotton production.

The experiment was conducted in Mojomulyo village, Tambakromo District, Pati, Central Java, from May to October 2011. The research was arranged in a Split Plot Design with three replications. The main plots were three lines/varieties of cotton: 99022 / 1; 99023 / 5 and Kanesia 13. The subplots were sixdose of combination of N fertilizer with PGR namely (1) N 90 + mepiquat chloride; (2) N 90 + pachlobutrasol; (3) N 90 without PGR; (4) N 120 + mepiquat chloride; (5) N 120 + pachlobutrasol; and (6) N 120 without PGR.

In this experiment, cotton plants were grown in growth chambers to study the response to MC as affected by temperature and to determine if an increase in dose could overcome the temperature effects. <b>Mepiquat</b> <b>chloride</b> was applied at rates of 0, 15 and 30 g ai ha- 1 at the pinhead square stage. Plants were then grown under three temperature regimes: 25 / 15 °C, 32 / 22 °C, and 39 / 29 °C (day/night temperatures) for 51 days. Higher temperatures increased plant height, reproductive branches, fruit number, fruit abscission, and photosynthesis per unit area, but decreased leaf area and chlorophyll. The largest effect of MC on plant height was observed when the daily temperature was 32 °C, with nights of 22 °C, which was also best for plant growth. High temperatures not only decreased the effectiveness of MC on plant height control, but also caused lower dry matter and fruit number per plant. Low temperatures (25 / 15 ºC) decreased cotton growth and fruit retention, but a higher concentration of MC was required per unit of growth reduction as compared with 32 / 22 ºC.
