Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk.

In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs in a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E

He {{is said to have been}} a firm but fair man, who had a great love for the Crystal Palace, and soon set about restoring the deteriorating building. The restoration not only brought visitors back, but also meant that the Palace started to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> profit once more.

25|$|Alternatives: In the 1960s, it was fashionable for {{men as well}} {{as women}} to wear scarves with a suit in a tied knot either inside a shirt as an Ascot or under the collar as would be worn like a tie. This style began to fade by the mid-1970s and came back in the 1990s mainly for women. It did however <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{comeback}} by 2005 and some famous stars wear them. Although some wore scarves back in the 1960s, ties were still preferred among business workers.|$|E
25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.|$|E

25|$|Chona {{was widely}} {{respected}} in Zambia {{as a good}} administrator and as Kaunda's loyal lieutenant. He contributed immensely to the organization of UNIP and to Zambia's struggle for independence. Although {{his role in the}} establishment of a one-party state in Zambia was controversial, he shrewdly produced a report on the subject that, in some respects, stood the test of time. He seemed to lack personal ambition and did not enrich himself through political office. His deep interest in Tonga culture, language and history led him to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> contribution to Tonga literature: his Chitonga novel, Kabuca Uleta Tunji, was awarded the Margaret Wrong medal in 1956.

O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages {{of those who had}} fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. He would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.|$|E
25|$|Julie Talma, born Louise-Julie Careau (8 January 1756 – 5 May 1805), was a French dancer at the Paris Opera {{who became}} a courtesan {{in the years before}} the French Revolution. She had three sons by three {{different}} fathers. She used the gifts from her protectors to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> fortune in real estate speculation. She married the well-known tragic actor François-Joseph Talma a few days before giving birth to twin sons. Her husband was unfaithful and ruined her. They separated and eventually divorced. Julie Talma was charming, intelligent, strong-willed, rational and a firm republican. She held an influential salon before and during the revolution and at the start of Napoleon's rise to power, and became a close friend of Benjamin Constant. Their lengthy correspondence has been preserved.|$|E

25|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{were developed}} to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. They inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing {{to a few}} hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E
25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E

500|$|Universal {{agreed to}} greenlight Radioland Murders if Lucas would [...] "update" [...] the script. The Huyck/Katz script {{contained}} parodies of old-time radio {{that the general}} public in the 1970s would likely acknowledge. Universal reasoned that the script {{would have to be}} modified in an attempt to accustom audiences from the MTV Generation. Based on Ron Howard's recommendation, Lucas hired Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn (known for their work on Moonlighting) to [...] "update" [...] the screenplay. The shooting script was prepared by Lucas, who combined his favorite elements of the Reno/Osborn draft with the original Huyck/Katz script from the 1970s. Lucas then hired Mel Smith to direct, who recommended Brian Benben for the lead role. Lucas specifically choose Smith because he believed the British comedian/filmmaker could handle Radioland Murders form of slapstick comedy and dark humor. Universal was adamant that the ensemble cast be filled with then-popular TV stars of the early 1990s.
