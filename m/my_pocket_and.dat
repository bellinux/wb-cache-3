25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Swift solely penned [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] in {{the summer}} of 2008 and stored it away for a while. After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine's Day, Swift offered the song to the film {{producers}} for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album. [...] "When this movie opportunity came about, I reached back into <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told The Tennessean. [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] was released as a single from the Valentine's Day soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the iTunes Store. The single was re-released on February 15, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|I had 75l. in <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> four {{slabs of}} chocolate, but the compass and the map {{which might have}} guided me, the opium tablets and meat {{lozenges}} which should have sustained me, were in my friend's pockets in the State Model Schools [...]|$|E

60|$|Now, I’m {{not like}} that. I can’t sit still and see another man slaving and working. I {{want to get}} up and superintend, and walk round with my hands in <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> tell him what to do. It is my {{energetic}} nature. I can’t help it.|$|R
500|$|... "They {{would not}} let me open it without searching <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> depriving me of pen, ink, and paper; {{and at the same}} time two prelati kept me in {{constant}} conversation in Latin, and if I looked at a passage too long, they would snatch the book out of my hand".|$|R
2500|$|The 1993 song [...] "Practice Lookin' Hard", by E40, has {{a chorus}} and a concept {{built around the}} lyric [...] "I got a mirror in <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> I {{practice}} lookin' hard", from The Coup's 1993 song [...] "Not Yet Free". Boots Riley performs the vocal in the E40 song, and performs in the video alongside Tupac Shakur and E40.|$|E
2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, The Tonic, {{a member}} of Christian hip hop group The Cross Movement, criticized the Tunnel Rats in an interview, accusing the group of placing more {{importance}} on musical credibility than sharing the Gospel. Fans of The Cross Movement also criticized The Tunnel Rats, claiming {{that they did not}} distinguish themselves enough from aggressive, secular West Coast rappers. In response to the accusations, Tunnel Rats released Tunnel Vision, which featured a raw, turbulent sound which, according to Imade Nibokun in LA Weekly, [...] "was a musical middle finger to anyone who found their battle-rap bravado sinful." [...] Nibokun cited in particular the song [...] "T.R.'z", which criticizes Christian rappers with sub-par musical ability, where Dax Reynosa aggressively opens with the rapped line [...] "I pull a pistol out <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> I cock it".|$|E
60|$|Here Captain Good {{nodded his}} head vigorously to himself. The ship gave a big roll just then, so that the looking-glass, which was fixed {{opposite}} us to starboard, was for a moment nearly over our heads, and as I was sitting with my hands in <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> staring upwards, I could see him nodding like anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I frisked <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> {{commenced}} to dribble {{a stream}} of halves and quarters into Thomas's hat. The information was of the pile-driver system of news, and it telescoped my intellects for a while. While I was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside, and suffering disturbances internally, I was saying, idiotically and pleasantly: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} contain myself. I started {{up from my}} seat--looked round on the company with fiery indignation--thrust both my hands into <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> strode {{up to one of}} the windows, as though I would have walked through it. I stopped short; looked out upon the {{landscape}} without distinguishing a feature of it; and felt my gorge rising almost to suffocation.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the war had}} {{finished}} and Sumich returned to Croatia he found a [...] "flourishing faith". [...] "They had broken free from communism and the church was free". [...] "Everyone had rosaries in their pockets." [...] Sumich found himself [...] "practising as a Catholic {{for the first time}} in my life, as distinct from just going to Sunday Mass. He wanted to know more about the Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, and you are the first one to chuck the towel in when the going gets tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite". He was accepted by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and went to their formation house, [...] the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, but he did most of his studies in Denton, Nebraska at Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary [...] where he was ordained deacon in [...] March 2008.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he said. [...] "I {{stood like}} a stuffed calf. She just looked back once, you know, and stood smiling like and crying--I {{could see the}} shine of her eyes--and then she was gone, and there was all these little fellows bustling about me, {{stuffing}} <b>my</b> 'ands <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> {{the back of my}} collar and everywhere with gold." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} gold, slipped {{it with an}} {{indifferent}} air into <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> then refolded <b>my</b> arms across my breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--I {{wanted to}} see little Mary again, and two worthy old gentlemen beside, you see. However, those Russians are generous enough. They filled <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> heaped me with presents; that {{bracelet}} among them. What's more, Mary, I've been introduced to old Nick himself, and can testify, from personal experience, to the correctness of Shakspeare's opinion that the prince of darkness is a gentleman." ...|$|R
60|$|Doubling up the newspaper, I thrust it into <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> sped swiftly {{out of the}} patio.|$|E

60|$|He {{made such}} a noise that the {{landlord}} wot was waiting for 'is money, asked 'im wot he meant by it, and, arter he 'ad explained, I'm blest if the landlord didn't advise him to search me.

60|$|It {{was five}} in the morning, and four {{thousand}} feet above the sea; and I had to bury my hands in <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> trot. People were trooping out to the labours of the field by twos and threes, and all turned round to stare upon the stranger. I had seen them coming back last night, I saw them going afield again; {{and there was the}} life of Bouchet in a nutshell.|$|R
60|$|My hand closed {{suddenly}} upon it, {{and again}} I looked searchingly around. There {{was not a}} soul in sight. I slipped the ring into <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> {{moved back to the}} white railings. I leaned against them, and, taking a pipe <b>and</b> tobacco from <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> began to smoke.|$|R
6000|$|I hastily {{snatched}} {{the book from}} <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> commenced to search for dialogues dealing with the great food question. There were none! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{crumpled}} up {{the letter}} in <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> forgot it the moment after, in the all-absorbing interest of my coming interview with Rachel.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, {{and she looked}} at me. Then I took the double-barrelled pistol out of <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> gave it to her.|$|E

60|$|But the ten {{thousand}} francs crackled pleasantly in <b>my</b> breast <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> when I finally took leave of Monsieur Aristide Fournier and his charming wife, I was an exceedingly happy man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{folded up}} the paper flat, put it into <b>my</b> inside <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> went to Rufe's room. He was nearly dressed, and was feeding the pig {{the rest of the}} milk and some apple-peelings.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. I put my hand in <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> drew out the empty envelope.|$|E
60|$|And in one {{of these}} raving fits I drew my {{revolver}} from <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> fired into the quiet night. Three times I fired it.|$|E

60|$|I drew it from <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> Guest came <b>and</b> {{looked over}} my shoulder. Half-way {{down the list}} {{he pointed to a}} name.|$|R
60|$|I {{thrust the}} {{telegram}} into <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> finished the rubber. Soon afterwards I cut {{out and took}} a hansom round to Claridge's Hotel. I found my brother in and expecting to hear from me.|$|R
