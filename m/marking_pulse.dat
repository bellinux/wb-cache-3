40|$|Cardiovascular and {{respiratory}} changes resulting from systematic {{stimulation of the}} hippocampal formation of the monkey were recorded. Stimulation of the anterior portion of the hippocampus resulted in a marked depression or cessation of respiratory excursions, but without apparent changes in respiratory rate. Respiratory changes were minimal to absent when posterior regions of the hippocampus were activated. Anterior hippocampal stimulation resulted in an initial depression of blood pressure accompanied by a small drop in pulse rate, followed by a rise in blood pressure which lasted throughout the period of stimulation and then gradually returned to former levels. The duration of the rise in blood pressure following cessation of stimulation was directly correlated with hippocampal activity. Posterior hippocampal stimulation did not show the secondary rise in pressure, only the depression. <b>Marked</b> <b>pulse</b> changes occurred only when the hippocampal gyrus was secondarily activated or stimulated directly. The neuron pathways which mediated these responses fall into two general groups, the fornix system and a hippocampotemporal system or both.

40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{value in the}} {{indirect}} determination of the blood pressure the sounds at the brachial artery provide other valuable clinical information. Their value in blood pressure determination in auricular fibrillation generally {{has been found to}} be limited. By using a simple technic involving the counting of the brachial-artery-sound deficit, a satisfactory, repeatable method of blood pressure estimation is achieved in such patients with <b>marked</b> <b>pulse</b> rate irregularities. Other information, including a rough estimation of left ventricular stroke output, pulse wave force and velocity, are also appraised by analysis of these bruits. ASIDE from their common use for estimation of the blood pressure level,' the Korotkoff sounds also provide other useful clinical information. Thus, the intensity and duration of the sounds provide an appraisal of the volume of blood flowing through the artery under the cuff. 2 A cali-brated contour of the upstroke of the pulse wave, as well as an estimate of the celerity of its transmission rate, can also be established. 3 The present study provides evidence that the time of onset of the sounds during the cardiac cycle is related to the diastolic filling time. In auricular fibrillation the determination of the incidence of the sounds at various cuff pressure levels permits a satisfactory measure of the blood pressure level despite irregularities of the pulse.

METHODS: We evaluated 160 diabetic patients, divided into four groups of 20 men and 20 women according to age (G 1, 20 - 30 years old; G 2, 31 - 40 years old; G 3, 41 - 50 years old; and G 4, 51 - 60 years old), and 160 non-diabetic matched control subjects. Each subject underwent a 3 min posture test (standing-squatting-standing) with continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure and heart rate by a Finapres device. Overall values throughout the test, baseline levels in initial standing position and squatting-induced changes in pulse pressure, heart rate and the pulse pressure x heart rate product were compared between diabetic patients and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: In the standing position, a greater increase in pulse pressure and lower reduction in heart rate with age led to a significantly higher pulse pressure x heart rate product in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. In the squatting position, a more <b>marked</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure increase {{in the absence of}} appropriate reduction in heart rate resulted in a greater rise in the pulse pressure x heart rate product in diabetic patients than in healthy subjects. No major differences were noted between the sexes, {{with the exception of a}} stronger relationship between pulse pressure and age in the female population with diabetes. Squatting-derived indices of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy were also noted with increasing age in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The marked increase in the pulse pressure x heart rate product ('pulsatile stress') according to age, combined with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, may contribute to the higher cardiovascular risk of patients with Type 1 diabetes.

40|$|The morpho-tectonic and {{sedimentary}} {{evolution of}} the Mercure intramontane basin (Calabria- Lucania boundary, southern Apennines) has been assessed through facies analysis, morphostratigraphy and geomorphological correlation with adjacent areas. The Mercure basin, {{one of the most}} active seismogenic zones of the southern Apennines, is a favorable area for reconstructing the main stages of landscape {{evolution of the}} axial zone because of its capability to record changes in base level during the Quaternary. In addition, the presence of both erosional and depositional palaeosurfaces is a useful marker for reconstructing tectonic and morphogenetic events, and hence to detect the role played by tectonics and climate in its genesis, evolution and extinction. The present study identifies the key role of tectonics and denudation, combined with highfrequency floods, as mechanisms controlling alluvial sedimentation in the study area. During endorheic conditions, denudational processes driven by pulses of extensional deformation of he basin margin caused strong alluvial inputs that resulted in the development of alluvial fans. Alluvial facies are mainly characterized by turbulent, subaerial, hyperconcentrated flood flows deposited during the glacial, semi-arid conditions of MIS 14. The retrogradational stacking pattern of the alluvial system indicates decreasing rates of tectonic activity along with declining river gradients. The Mercure coalescing alluvial fans were inundated by lake transgression during MIS 13 in response to (i) abrupt tectonic subsidence at the basin margins and (ii) large decrease of coarse sediment supply due to the interplay among climate, tectonics and catchment size changes. In this regard, it is suggested that tectonic control on the drainage network along with climate and long-term slope evolution may have caused <b>marked</b> <b>pulses</b> in sediment supply, thus influencing the arrangement of facies associations in the sedimentary succession. In addition, the study points out that the main tectonic landforms developed during each period of the landscape evolution well correspond with some active fault segments...|$|R

PPD and its response to CTZ were not altered by prior depletion of the releasable vesicle pool but were blocked by lowering external calcium concentration, while raising external calcium enhanced PPD. We conclude that {{a major component of}} PPD at the endbulb is due to a novel, transient depression of release, which is dependent on the level of presynaptic calcium entry and is CTZ sensitive...|$|R

40|$|New thermo-mechanical {{models of}} mantle {{lithosphere}} removal {{from beneath the}} southern Sierra Nevada, California, predict a complex spatio – temporal pattern of vertical surface displacements. We evaluate these models by using (U-Th) /He thermochronometry, together with other paleothermometry estimates, to investigate such topographic transients. We target sediments from the Kern Arch, a fan-shaped uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western flank of the southern Sierra. Kern Arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth. Detrital apatite (U-Th) /He ages from Oligo-Miocene sandstones collected in Kern Arch well cores indicate post-depositional heating to temperatures beyond those corresponding with their present burial depths. When integrated with available geologic and stratigraphic constraints, temperature – time modeling of thermochronometry data suggests partial He loss from apatites at temperatures of 70 ° – 90 °C, followed by exhumation to present burial temperatures of 35 ° – 60 °C since ca. 6 Ma. Assuming a regional late Cenozoic geothermal gradient of 25 °C/km, our results imply 1. 0 – 1. 6 km of rapid (~ 0. 4 mm/yr) burial and subsequent exhumation of southeastern San Joaquin sediments in latest Miocene - Quaternary time. Subtle differences in the maximum temperatures achieved in various wells may reflect differing degrees of tectonic subsidence and sedimentation {{as a function of}} distance from the range front. Our results are consistent with estimates of surface subsidence and uplift from Sierran delamination models, which predict a minimum of 0. 8 km of subsidence in regions presently associated with mantle lithosphere at depth, and a minimum of 0. 6 km of surface uplift in regions where delamination has recently occurred. We attribute the <b>marked</b> <b>pulse</b> of tectonic subsidence in the San Joaquin Basin to viscous coupling between the lower crust and a downwelling mass in the delaminating slab.

40|$|Lacustrine {{deposits}} form {{most of the}} sedimentary record accumulated {{throughout the}} Miocene {{in the northern part}} of the Teruel Graben, a landlocked basin situated in NE Spain. Three main stratigraphic units (Units I–III) spanning Late Vallesian to Late Turolian in age, are distinguished in the area. The two former units comprise mainly carbonate lacustrine deposits that were deposited in a palustrine or a more permanent but shallow lacustrine setting, the latter being related mainly to periods of lake expansion under more humid and cooler climatic conditions. In contrast, deposition of Unit III, characterised by gypsiferous lacustrine sediments in central parts of the basin, reflects the influence of source rocks of evaporitic nature (Upper Triassic formations) that were emplaced by diapiric uplift in the eastern margin during the Middle Turolian. Carbonate lake sediments belonging to Units I and II consist of four main lithofacies associations: (a) distal–alluvial lake margin deposits; (b) lacustrine carbonates and pedogenically modified lacustrine carbonates; (c) carbonate fill channels; and (d) organic-rich marlstone and carbonate (marshes). Lithofacies association (a) shows typically a sequential arrangement formed, from bottom to top, of red mudstone, carbonate palaeosols and biomicrite beds (sequence type 1 a). These sequences are interpreted as a result of slow but continuous aggradation of the floodplain areas and subsequent rise of the water table, probably reflecting equilibrium between subsidence and sedimentation. Lithofacies association (b) consisting of biomicrite beds passing upward into palaeosols (sequence type 1 b) is thought to be caused by <b>marked</b> <b>pulses</b> of tectonic subsidence that created the accommodation space required for fast development of a carbonate lake. Carbonate fill channels, showing erosive lower surfaces dig out on previous channels, marsh deposits and/or lacustrine carbonates, exhibit well-developed prismatic structure at their bed tops. The sequential arrangement suggests similar tectonic constrains than the envisaged for lithofacies 1 b. The comparison of depositional styles of the lake systems with the palaeoclimatic evolutionary pattern of the basin throughout the Miocene indicates that the combined effect of tectonism, climate and source rock played a major role in the stratigraphic framework of the basin during this period...|$|R

We target Tertiary strata from the Kern arch, a crescent-shaped active uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western flank of the southern Sierra Nevada. Kern arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth.

By constraining the late Cenozoic geothermal gradient to ∼ 25 °C/km, our results imply 1. 0 – 1. 6 km of rapid (∼ 0. 4 mm/yr) subsidence and sedimentation, and then subsequent uplift and exhumation of southeastern San Joaquin Basin strata in latest Miocene–Quaternary time.

Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, <b>marks,</b> or <b>pulses,</b> in on off keying and are commonly known as [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs".

No significant differences were found in microbial fluxes between 1000 and 4700 m depth, but both the bacterial biomass flux and the frequency of dividing bacteria increased with depth, suggesting that organic matter turnover and conversion into bacterial biomass increased in the deeper traps. The structure of microbial assemblages displayed clear changes with increasing depth; the ratios of bacteria to both flagellates and cyanobacteria increased up to 4 -fold between 1000 and 4700 m, showing a marked increase in bacterial dominance in the deeper layers of the water column.

Two {{of the reasons for}} the relat-ively less accurate performance of liquid scintillation counters are considered in more detail: the problems created by the <b>marked</b> rise in <b>pulse</b> rates at low pulse heights and the relative inefficiency with which scintilla-tions due to low energy electrons are converted into detectable signals. Accurate results have been realised by extrapolating plots of countrates taken as function of discriminator levels but only for emitters with end point energies above about 200 keV. Besides, extrapolation procedures are as yet unsupported by accepted models of the liquid scintillation detection process. However, more recently introduced methods are making it possible to count the activities even of 14 C and 3 H with accuracies comparable to those attained in internal gas proportional counters, i. e. about ± 1 per cent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cyanogenic glycosides {{are found}} in many native and {{naturalized}} plants throughout North Amer-ica. The glycosides themselves are not toxic, but they yield hydrogen cyanide (hydrocyanic or prussic acid) when they are hydrolyzed by b-glycosidases, either {{as a result of}} injury to the plant cells or by microbial action in the rumen. Hydrogen cyanide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Cyanide ion binds with iron in cytochrome oxidase, interfering with cellular respiration. The clinical effects are peracute, often resulting in death less than 1 hour after ingestion. This study describes a case that resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in a herd of goats after exposure to California holly (Heteromeles arbutifolia). Acute poisonings by plants containing cyanogenic glycosides are infrequently reported in goats. This is largely because of their browsing habits, which limit the amount of any 1 plant that is ingested. It is also likely that cases of acute death in goats are not eval-uated and go undiagnosed. Goats have been used as experimental models for chronic cyanide ingestion; 10 therefore, their response to repeated subtoxic expo-sures has been well described. A clinical case of acute morbidity and mortality in a herd of goats after inges-tion of Heteromeles arbutifolia is presented. A backyard herd of 60 goats was maintained long-term on a diet consisting mostly of squash and cactus, and free access to a mineral block. In February 2002, after pruning what were believed to be olive trees, a neighbor donated the clippings that were subsequently fed to the goat herd. The clippings were later identified as H. arbutifolia. Within 4 hours of feeding, 3 animals died, and 7 were moribund. The affected animals were tachycardic and had <b>marked</b> jugular <b>pulses.</b> Mucous membranes were pale pink. No treatment was institut-ed in the affected, surviving goats. Field necropsies revealed multifocal hemorrhages in lungs and heart and congestion of the gastrointestinal tract. Kidney, lung, and liver were examined histologically from 3 animals. In addition, heart and abomasum were ex-amined from 2 of 3 animals and small intestine fro...|$|R
30|$|Ternary {{coatings}} Fe-Co-W with an {{iron content}} of 40 – 55  at.%, cobalt 39 – 44  at.%, and tungsten 4 – 12  at.% and Fe-Co-Mo {{with an iron}} content of 40 – 55  at.%, cobalt 39 – 44  at.%, and tungsten 4 – 12  at.% were obtained by galvanostatic and pulse electrolysis on the mild steel substrate from iron(III) citrate-based electrolyte. The influence of electrolysis mode and parameters on composition of deposited alloys was studied. The competing reduction of iron and tungsten in Fe-Co-W coatings {{as well as the}} competitive deposition of iron and cobalt in Fe-Co-Mo coatings at various current densities were defined. Simultaneously, the alloy enrichment with molybdenum is more <b>marked</b> at a <b>pulse</b> mode. Atomic force microscope analysis of the Fe-Co-W alloy coating morphology and surface topography indicates their globular structure with spherical grains in the range of 2.5 – 3.5  μm. The surface of Fe-Co-Mo is characterized by parts of a globular structure with an average conglomerate size of 0.3 – 0.5  μm and singly located cone-shaped hills with a base diameter of 3  μm. Sites with a developed surface were detected within the same scan area which topography is identical to the crystal lattice of cobalt with the crystalline conglomerate sizes in the range of 0.2 – 1.75  μm.|$|R
40|$|Frequent blood {{sampling}} from males rats {{was used to}} study hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation during arthritis and its association with diminished responses to acute psychological stress. In control rats, corticosterone release occurred {{in a series of}} 13 t 1 pulses per 24 h. Induction of arthritis by Mycobacterium-adjuvant injection initially increased the rate of hormone release within each pulse and, by day 14 postinjection, when hind-paw in¯ammation was established, caused a <b>marked</b> increase in <b>pulse</b> frequency to 22 t 1 per 24 h leading directly to elevated circulating corticosterone levels. In both control and adjuvant-treated rats, there was a marked response to a 10 -min noise stress when the stimulus coincided with a rising or interpulse phase of the endogenous corticosterone rhythm. However, when the noise stress coincided with a falling phase of this rhythm, the response was greatly diminished. Since corticosterone pulse frequency was markedly increased and hence interpulse interval decreased by day 14, there was an increased probability of the noise stress occurring during the nonstress responsive falling phase of the corticosterone secretory cycle. As a result, the group mean response to noise stress was signi®cantly smaller in the arthritic than the controls (70. 2 t 9. 2 versus 107. 8 t 13. 0 ng/ml, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{eclogite}} facies Zermatt-Saas ophiolite in the Western Alps {{includes a}} composite chaotic unit exposed in the Lake Miserin area, {{in the southern}} Aosta Valley region. The chaotic unit {{is characterized by a}} block-in-matrix texture consisting of ultramafic clasts and blocks embedded within a carbonate matrix. This unit overlies massive serpentinite and ophicarbonate rocks and is unconformably overlain by layered calcschist. Despite the effects of subduction and collision-related deformation and metamorphism, the internal stratigraphy and architecture of the chaotic unit are recognizable and are attributed to different types of mass transport processes in the Jurassic Ligurian-Piedmont Ocean. This finding represents an exceptional record of the preorogenic history of the Alpine ophiolites, <b>marked</b> by different <b>pulses</b> of extensional tectonics responsible for the rough seafloor topography characterized by structural highs exposed to submarine erosion. The Jurassic tectonostratigraphic setting envisioned is comparable to that observed in present-day magma-poor slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, characterized by mantle exposure along fault scarps that trigger mass transport deposits and turbiditic sedimentation. Our preorogenic reconstruction is significant in an eclogitized collisional orogenic belt in which chaotic rock units may be confused with the exclusive product of subduction-related tectonics, thus obscuring the record of an important preorogenic history. © 2017 Geological Society of America...|$|R
