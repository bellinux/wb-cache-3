6000|$|The {{working of}} metals and {{agriculture}} {{have been the}} two great agents in this revolution. For the poet it is gold and silver, but for the philosopher it is iron and corn, that have civilised men and undone the human race. It {{is easy to see}} how the latter of the two arts was suggested to men by watching the reproducing processes of vegetation. It is less easy to be sure how they discovered <b>metal,</b> <b>saw</b> its uses, and invented means of smelting it, for nature had taken extreme precautions to hide the fatal secret. It was probably the operation of some volcano which first suggested the idea of fusing ore. From the fact of land being cultivated its division followed, and therefore the institution of property in its full shape. From property arose civil society. [...] "The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, could think of saying, This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. How many crimes, wars, murders, miseries, and horrors would not have been spared to the human race by one who, plucking up the stakes, or filling in the trench, should have called out to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you forget that the earth belongs to no one, and that its fruits are for all."[188] ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a sawing machine, such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric reciprocating saws. These machines differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and saw by rapidly reciprocating a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of <b>metal</b> <b>sawing</b> is an important economic factor. The mechanics of <b>metal</b> <b>sawing</b> with traditional machines have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of reciprocating sawing. Research was undertaken to describe <b>metal</b> <b>sawing</b> with reciprocating saws by the application of metal cutting mechanics. Cutting rates of metals with a reciprocating saw are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the saw, the reciprocating speed of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the cutting rate of metals with a reciprocating saw. Particular attention was placed on the sawing rates of steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for reciprocating sawing rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw blade teeth was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and reciprocating speed on cutting rates of steel. Results of analytical predictions from the newly developed sawing model and empirical data compared reasonably well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Stone cutting {{industry}} {{is one of}} the major environmental pollutants in Palestine. The pollution process starts by mining rocks from quarries and transporting them to stone cutting plants distributed around the West Bank. The mining and transporting process is usually associated with different types of pollution such as air, noise and soil contamination. In stone cutting plants, rock blocks are cut into different sizes and shapes. The cutting and shaping process is accomplished by using <b>metal</b> <b>saws</b> which need a tremendous amount of cooling water. The cooling water is discharged out of the plant as highly viscous material referred to as stone slurry waste. The stone slurry waste poses a serious environmental hazard.

40|$|This {{research}} {{involves the}} analysis of artifacts from two sites in southwestern Saskatchewan with the primary focus on {{the analysis of}} precontact/protohistoric pottery. The Antelope Creek site (EeOc- 2) {{is located on the}} South Saskatchewan River at the mouth of Antelope Creek, and the Miry Creek site (EeOc- 5) is approximately 15 km upstream at the mouth of Miry Creek. These artifacts, which are part of the Heron collection, provided a valuable source of information about the regional archaeology of southwestern Saskatchewan. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of each of the Antelope Creek and Miry Creek site vessels will allow for future comparisons between the ceramics from these and other sites. The Antelope Creek site contains artifacts diagnostic of the Middle Precontact to Historic periods. Pottery consistent with Besant, Avonlea, Old Women's, and Mortlach assemblages has been identified. Bone and lithic tools typical of habitation sites were present, and several unique artifacts including an incised tablet and smoking pipes were also recovered. The Miry Creek site collection contains Mortlach and Old Women's cultural materials and a sparse quantity of Avonlea, Besant, and Middle Precontact period projectile points. Numerous artifacts relating to the fur trade and homestead eras are also present. AMS dates on food residue from two Mortlach vessels suggest the Mortlach component dates to the Protohistoric period.

The influences of notch shape (radial, rectangular, or angular-shaped and variety of thicknesses), pre-cracking method, chip removing or non-chip removing, and the contact or non-contact methods on the results obtained in fracture toughness tests were investigated. The results were analyzed by two methods, quantitatively and qualitatively, by comparing the obtained Kc results and studying the SEM and optical microscopy images, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} different conditions of a produced pre-crack including; geometry of pre-crack due to geometry of tools, residual stress due to pre-crack creation, heat affected zone, damage of crack tip, and producing crazing around the crack tip could affect the fracture toughness. The maximum difference resulted from different pre-cracking methods was equal to 0. 24 MPa. m 0. 5 and the lowest value of fracture toughness Kc, 2. 53 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the scoring method but the highest value, 2. 77 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the <b>metal</b> slitting <b>saw</b> method.
