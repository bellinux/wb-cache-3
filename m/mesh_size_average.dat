P. Bandyopadhyay, University of North Dakota, and Dr. R. Ohmori, of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RINEN), Tokyo, Japan, from June through August, 1994. Dr. Ohmori pioneered the novel ELID grinding technology which incorporates electrolytically enhanced, in-process dressing of metal bonded superabrasive wheels. The principle of ELID grinding technology is discussed in the report as will its application for rough grinding and precision grinding. Two types of silicon nitride based ceramics (Kyocerals Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }, and Eaton`s SRBSN) were ground under various conditions with ELID methods.

40|$|The {{result of}} 2 -dimensional Gaussian lattice fit to a speckle {{intensity}} pattern {{based on a}} linear model that includes nearest-neighbor interactions is presented. We also include a Monte Carlo simulation of the same spatial speckle pattern that takes the nearest-neighbor interactions into account. These nearest-neighbor interactions lead to a spatial variance structure on the lattice. The resulting spatial pattern fluctuates in value from point to point in a manner characteristic of a stationary stochastic process. The value at a lattice point in the simulation is interpreted as an inten-sity level and the difference in values in neighboring cells produces a fluctuating intensity pattern on the lattice.
