5000|$|After the Congress, deaf {{education}} in America changed. Manualists, those who advocated for sign language usage, were effectively [...] "kicked out" [...] {{and replaced with}} teachers who used the pure oral method. Deaf teachers {{were removed from the}} profession and replaced with hearing ones. Most schools switched to the oral method or were created as oral schools in the first place, and few manual schools remained in existence. The work of deaf educators in the oralist schools, who were mostly women, was to prepare the deaf children for life in the hearing world, which required them to learn English, speech, and lipreading. All students that were sent to the oral schools were forced to use the oral method, and oralist schools restricted the deaf students' use of American Sign Language (ASL) in class and in public. Students in pure oral programs were not allowed to sign in class and were also forbidden to sign in dormitories. Students caught signing were punished, but students continued to learn sign from each other anyway. One type of punishment used on deaf students was to force them to wear white gloves that were tied together to prevent them from using signs. Those who were not successful under the oral method after several years were transferred to <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> and considered [...] "oral failures" [...] who would never know anything or {{be able to make it}} in the world.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Twelve {{countries}} {{were compared with}} respect to occupational class differences in ischemic heart disease mortality {{in order to identify}} factors that are associated with smaller or larger mortality differences. METHODS: Data on mortality by occupational class among men aged 30 to 64 years were obtained from national longitudinal or cross-sectional studies for the 1980 s. A common occupational class scheme was applied to most countries. Potential effects of the main data problems were evaluated quantitatively. RESULTS: A north-south contrast existed within Europe. In England and Wales, Ireland, and Nordic countries, <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> had higher mortality rates than nonmanual classes. In France, Switzerland, and Mediterranean countries, <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> had mortality rates as low as, or lower than, those among nonmanual classes. Compared with Northern Europe, mortality differences in the United States were smaller (among men aged 30 - 44 years) or about as large (among men aged 45 - 64 years). CONCLUSIONS: The results underline the highly variable nature of socioeconomic inequalities in ischemic heart disease mortality. These inequalities appear to be highly sensitive to social gradients in behavioral risk factors. These risk factor gradients are determined by cultural as well as socioeconomic development...|$|E

40|$|Self-rated health (SRH) predicts future mortality. Individuals in {{different}} social classes with similar physical health status {{may have different}} reference levels and criteria against which they judge their health, therefore the SRH-mortality relationship may vary according to social class. We {{examine the relationship between}} SRH and mortality by occupational social class in a prospective study of 22, 457 men and women aged 39 - 79 years, without prevalent disease, living in the general community in Norfolk, United Kingdom, recruited using general practice age-sex registers in 1993 - 1997 and followed up for an average of 10 years. As expected, SRH was related to subsequent mortality. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for mortality for those with poor compared to those with excellent SRH was 4. 35 (95 % confidence interval 3. 38 - 5. 59, P< 0. 001). The prevalence of poor or moderate SRH was higher in manual than in non-manual classes. However, SRH was similarly related to mortality in manual and non-manual classes: when non-manual classes are compared with <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> for each category of SRH, the 95 % confidence intervals for the mortality hazard ratios overlap.

40|$|Background: Understanding {{how common}} mental {{disorders}} such as anxiety and depression vary with socio-economic circumstances as people age can help to identify key intervention points. However, much research treats these conditions as a single disorder when they differ significantly {{in terms of their}} disease burden. This paper examines the socio-economic pattern of anxiety and depression separately and longitudinally to develop a better understanding of their disease burden for key social groups at different ages. Method: The Twenty- 07 Study has followed 4510 respondents from three cohorts in the West of Scotland for 20 years and 3846 respondents had valid data for these analyses. Hierarchical repeated-measures models were used to investigate the relationship between age, social class and the prevalence of anxiety and depression over time measured as scores of 8 or more out of 21 on the relevant subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Social class differences in anxiety and depression widened with age. For anxiety there was a nonlinear decrease in prevalence with age, decreasing more slowly for those from <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> compared to non-manual, whereas for depression there was a non-linear increase in prevalence with age, increasing more quickly for those from <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> compared to non-manual. This relationship is robust to cohort, period and attrition effects. Conclusions: The more burdensome disorder of depression occurs more frequently at ages where socio-economic inequalities in mental health are greatest, representing a ‘double jeopardy’ for older people from a manual class...|$|E

There {{are reasons to}} expect that these differences are relatively small in southern European countries or in Nordic welfare states. This report therefore presents an international overview of socioeconomic differences in stroke mortality. METHODS: Unpublished data on mortality by occupational class were obtained from national longitudinal studies or cross-sectional studies. The data refer to deaths among men aged 30 to 64 years in the 1980 s. A common occupational class scheme was applied to most countries. The mortality difference between <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> and nonmanual classes was measured in relative terms (by rate ratios) and in absolute terms (by rate differences). RESULTS: In all countries, <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> had higher stroke mortality rates than nonmanual classes. This difference was relatively large in England and Wales, Ireland, and Finland and relatively small in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and Spain.

In most countries, inequalities were much larger for stroke mortality than for ischemic heart disease mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic differences in stroke mortality are a problem common to all countries studied. There are probably large variations, however, in the contribution that different risk factors, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, make to the stroke mortality excess of lower socioeconomic groups.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the association between occupational class and subsequent disability pension among middle-aged men and women, and to what extent work-related factors accounted for the association. Methods: A subsample (N = 7031) of the population-based Hordaland Health Study (HUSK) conducted in 1997 - 99, provided self-reported information on health and work-related factors, and were grouped in four strata by Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocareros occupational class scheme. The authors obtained follow-up data on disability pension by linking the health survey to national registries of benefit (FD-trygd). They employed Cox regression analysis and adjusted for gender, health (medical conditions, mental health, self-perceived health, somatic symptoms) and workrelated factors (working hours, years in current occupation, physical demands, job demands, job control). Results: A strong gradient in disability pension by occupational class was found. In the fully adjusted model the risk (hazard ratio) ranged from 1. 41 (95 % CI 0. 84 to 2. 33) in the routine non-manual class, 1. 87 (95 % CI 1. 07 to 3. 27) in the skilled <b>manual</b> <b>class</b> and 2. 12 (95 % CI 1. 14 to 3. 95) in the unskilled <b>manual</b> <b>class,</b> employing the administrator and professional class as reference.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{quantify}} {{the contribution of}} different causes of death and age groups for trends in life expectancy for two major social classes.  DESIGN AND SETTING—Prospective study of mortality in Finland among all over 35  year old men and women. Baseline social class (manual/non-manual) was from the 1970,  1975,  1980,  1985  and 1990  census records, and follow up was by computerised record linkage to death certificates for 1971 - 1995.  MAIN RESULTS—From the early 1970 s to the early 1990 s life expectancy at age 35  increased by about five and four years among Finnish men and women respectively, with largest gains among 55 - 74 year old men and 65 - 84 year old women. Life expectancy increase was 5. 1  years among non-manual and 3. 8  years among manual men; corresponding figures for women were 3. 6  and 3. 0  years. In the 1980 s, when differences in life expectancy increased most rapidly, decline in cardiovascular disease mortality was more rapid in the non-manual than the <b>manual</b> <b>class.</b> Furthermore, increasing mortality for alcohol associated causes, "other diseases", and accidents and violence were most prominent in the <b>manual</b> <b>class.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Explanations of increasing social inequalities in mortality {{that are based on}} one underlying factor are difficult to reconcile with the variability in the cause specific trends in social inequalities in mortality. The contribution of older ages to social inequalities in mortality should be more widely recognised.    Keywords: life expectancy; social clas...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{social class}} differences in infant mortality in Sweden in the mid- 1980 s and to compare their magnitude {{with that of}} those found in England and Wales. DESIGN [...] Analysis of risk of infant death by social class in aggregated routine data for the mid- 1980 s, which included the linkage of Swedish births to the 1985 census. SETTING [...] Sweden and England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] All live births in Sweden (1985 - 6) and England and Wales (1983 - 5) and corresponding infant deaths were analysed. The Swedish data were coded to the British registrar general's social class schema. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Risk {{of death in the}} neonatal and postneonatal period. RESULTS [...] Taking the non-manual classes as the reference group, in the neonatal period in Sweden the manual social classes had a relative risk for mortality of 1. 20 (95 % confidence interval 1. 02 to 1. 43) and those not classified into a social class a relative risk of 1. 08 (0. 88 to 1. 33). In the postneonatal period the equivalent relative risks were 1. 38 (1. 08 to 1. 77) for <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> and 2. 14 (1. 65 to 2. 79) for the residual; these are similar to those for England and Wales (1. 43 (1. 36 to 1. 51) for <b>manual</b> <b>classes,</b> 2. 62 (2. 45 to 2. 81) for the residual). CONCLUSIONS [...] The existence of an equitable health care system and a strong social welfare policy in Sweden has not eliminated inequalities in post-neonatal mortality. Furthermore, the very low risk of infant death in the Swedish non-manual group (4. 8 / 1000 live births) represents a target towards which public health interventions should aim. If this rate prevailed in England and Wales, 63 % of postneonatal deaths would be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Background: Women {{experience}} poorer health {{than men}} despite their longer life expectancy, {{due to a}} higher prevalence of non-fatal chronic illnesses. This paper aims to explore whether the unequal gender distribution of roles and resources can account for inequalities in general self-rated health (SRH) by gender, across social classes, in a Southern European population. Methods: Cross-sectional study of residents in Catalonia aged 25 – 64, {{using data from the}} 2006 population living conditions survey (n= 5, 817). Poisson regression models were used to calculate the fair/poor SRH prevalence ratio (PR) by gender and to estimate the contribution of variables assessing several dimensions of living conditions as the reduction in the PR after their inclusion in the model. Analyses were stratified by social class (non-manual and manual). Results: SRH was poorer for women among both non-manual (PR 1. 39, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 1. 76) and manual social classes (PR 1. 36, 95 % CI 1. 20 – 1. 56). Adjustment for individual income alone eliminated the association between sex and SRH, especially among <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> (PR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 85 – 1. 19; among non-manual 1. 19, 0. 92 – 1. 54). The association was also reduced when adjusting by employment conditions among <b>manual</b> <b>classes,</b> and household material and economic situation, time in household chores and residential environment among non-manual classes. Discussion: Gender inequalities in individual income appear to contribute largely to women's poorer health. Individual income may indicate the availability of economic resources, but also the history of access to the labour market and potentially the degree of independence and power within the household. Policies to facilitate women's labour market participation, to close the gender pay gap, or to raise non-contributory pensions may be helpful to improve women's health...|$|E

40|$|Cross-sectional {{analyses}} of adult lifespan variation have found an inverse association between socioeconomic position and lifespan variation, but the trends by social class are unknown. We investigated trends in lifespan variation over four decades (1971 – 2010) by occupational social <b>class</b> (<b>manual,</b> lower nonmanual, upper nonmanual, other) using Finnish register data.

Although life expectancy increased in all classes, lifespan variation was stable among manual workers and decreased only among nonmanual classes. These differences were caused by early-adult mortality: older-age lifespan variation declined for all the classes, but variation in early-adult mortality increased for all classes except the highest.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine social inequalities in health as people age using longitudinal data from the West of Scotland Twenty- 07 Study to investigate the effect of selective mortality, the timing of the SES measure and cohort on the inequality patterns. Methods The Twenty- 07 Study has followed three cohorts, born around 1932, 1952 and 1972, from 1987 / 8 to 2007 / 8; 4, 510 respondents were interviewed at baseline and, at the most recent follow-up, 2, 604 were interviewed and 674 had died. Hierarchical repeated-measures models were estimated for self-assessed health status, with and without mortality, with baseline or time-varying social class, sex and cohort. Results Social inequalities in health emerge around the age of 30 after which they widen until the early 60 s and then begin to narrow, converging around the age of 75. This pattern is a result of those in <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> reporting poor health at younger ages, with the gap narrowing as the health of those in non-manual classes declines at older ages. However, employing a more proximal measure of SES reduces inequalities in middle age so that convergence of inequalities is not apparent in old age.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} how modernization processes influenced social openness in Hungarian municipalities between 1870 and 1950. Our {{focus is}} on relative occupational mobility, which reflects the underlying pattern of inequalities in attaining class positions. We derive hypotheses from the 'theory of industrialization' on the association between social fluidity and modernization processes. We test these for a late-industrializing country, Hungary. A large-scale historical micro-data set, spanning the period 1870 - 1950 is used to construct 633 mobility tables based on marriage cohorts within 62 municipalities. We specify parsimonious association models to estimate social fluidity from each mobility table, and test our hypotheses in a subsequent step, using multivariate regression analyses with cohort-and-municipality-based indicators of modernization processes. We use a stronger explanatory design than previous studies by including fixed effects to control for stable historical municipal characteristics. We find that increasing educational opportunities led {{to a decline in}} nonagrarian manual and nonmanual class rigidities, and that industrialization decreased class rigidities of the nonmanual classes. Agrarian class reproduction was unaffected by modernization. Modernization processes explain most of the temporal variation in the social fluidity of <b>manual</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|E

40|$|Data {{from the}} Cancer Research Campaign trial for early breast cancer {{have been used}} to study the effect of social class and weight on {{prognosis}} after primary treatment either by a simple mastectomy plus post-operative radiotherapy or by a simple mastectomy followed by a watch policy. There were 2455 patients for whom both social class could be determined and weight was recorded. These patients presented in clinical stages I and II and were recruited between June 1970 and April 1975. The cut-off date for the analysis was 31 December 1991. When the survival curves of patients in <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> were compared with those in non-manual classes, there was a tendency for the latter to do better, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 12). By contrast, there was a highly significant difference (P = 0. 002) in survival favouring patients weighing {{less than or equal to}} 60 kg compared with those weighing greater than 60 kg. The difference was confined to post-menopausal patients and was still highly significant when included in a multivariate analysis with social class, age, tumour size, clinical stage and tumour grade. The effect of weight was to increase the mortality due to breast cancer rather than other causes...|$|E
40|$|Male cancer patients' {{use of a}} {{national}} cancer information service, their requests and key predictors of these over the period April 1996 to March 1998 are presented, in comparison with women. The most frequent requests of 411 prostate, 162 male and 217 female colorectal cancer patients were similar: site-specific information, emotional support, publications, specific therapies. Research or clinical trials (P< 0. 05), diet and nutrition (P< 0. 001) requests differed between men with prostate and colorectal cancers; complementary therapies (P< 0. 05), prognosis (P< 0. 05) requests differed {{between male and female}} colorectal cancer patients. Among prostate cancer patients, employed men aged 60 + were more likely to need emotional support than retired men aged 70 +; men < 59 years old were more likely to request publications, but less likely to enquire about specific therapies than others. Among male colorectal cancer patients, employed men were less likely to request site-specific information, but more likely to need emotional support than retired men; patients from geographical areas other than Thames were more likely to request publications; patients from <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> were less likely to enquire about specific therapies than those from non-manual classes. The complexity of information and support seeking behaviour is demonstrated; no pattern was found among men or in comparison with women. Further research is needed to enable development of services that are appropriate to individual needs and concerns...|$|E
40|$|Social class – a {{classification}} of occupations – {{is a well-known}} concept. It is widely used by social analysts to measure the degree of inequality in society. This works in two ways. First, mobility analysts can compare the class of parents (typically fathers) to that of their children. Is society becoming more open? Second, it {{is used as a}} ‘gold standard ’ against which other measures can be compared. For instance, has the health of <b>manual</b> <b>classes</b> risen relative to that of non-manual classes? Many social scientists, primarily economists, have no interest in class at all, preferring measures of income as a basis for understanding inequality. Many sociologists are critical too. These critics have a wide variety of reasons for concern, but in the main these are that society is too complex to be reduced to a few small groupings. Other factors such as gender, ethnicity, but also consumption and lifestyle are more important. Even those who believe that class is useful wrangle over whether particular classifications are up to the job. The analysis in this paper is {{based on the idea that}} classes are useful but are more mixed and fragmented than sociological theory allows. Each class contains such a wide range in terms of earnings that a significant proportion of one class might earn less than th...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—The {{prevalence}} of respiratory symptoms {{has been found}} in some studies to vary with social class. One explanation of this link may be the effect of exposure to cigarette smoke. To investigate this, the relation between social class, smoking and respiratory symptoms was explored in a population based survey.  DESIGN—A cross sectional survey using a validated questionnaire.  SETTING—Two general practices in Staffordshire, United Kingdom.  PATIENTS—A random sample of 4237  patients aged 16  and over from two general practices in Staffordshire were mailed a questionnaire enquiring about respiratory symptoms and their severity.  MAIN RESULTS—The severity of respiratory symptoms increased with increasing exposure to cigarette smoke and was greater among <b>manual</b> social <b>classes.</b> Current smokers (odds ratio (OR)  =  2. 9,  95 % confidence limits (CI) 2. 3,  3. 6), past smokers (OR =  1. 5,  95 % CI 1. 2,  1. 8) and passive smokers (OR =  1. 4,  95 % CI 1. 0,  1. 8) {{were more likely to report}} the more severe respiratory symptoms compared with non-smokers. Responders from social class V (OR =  2. 4,  95 % CI 1. 3,  4. 4) were more likely to report the more severe respiratory symptoms compared with social class I, as were responders from social classes IIIM (OR =  1. 3,  95 % CI 0. 9,  1. 9) and IV (OR =  1. 4,  95 % CI 0. 9,  2. 1). These effects were independent of each other.  CONCLUSIONS—This study has shown that social class is linked to the severity of respiratory symptoms, independently of smoking. Although the need to reduce and quit smoking in <b>manual</b> <b>class</b> households remains a crucial preventive issue, other mechanisms by which social class differences may influence symptom occurrence and severity need to be explored.    Keywords: social class; smoking; respiratory symptom...|$|R
40|$|Aim To examine {{cardiovascular}} {{mortality of}} African migrants in Portugal {{in relation to}} socio-economic status. Method Data from death registrations, 1998 – 2002, and the 2001 Census were used to derive standardized death rates by country of birth and occupational class/marital status. Results Compared with native Portuguese, African migrants had higher mortality for all causes, circulatory disease, coronary heart disease and stroke. There was considerable heterogeneity among Africans with Cape Verdeans having higher mortality than Angolans or Mozambiquans. Class differences in mortality were generally greater for African than for Portuguese men. Although the coronary heart disease mortality rate among Africans in a <b>manual</b> <b>class</b> was twice that of those in a nonmanual class, there was no class difference for Portuguese men. Marital status was associated with 2 – 3 -fold differences in mortality rates in both Africans and Portuguese. A larger proportion of Africans were not married which accounted {{for some of the}} excess mortality. Conclusion Adverse cardiovascular mortality experience of African migrants is associated with socio-environmental factors. Investigating how best to achieve risk reduction in Africans should be a public health priority in Portugal...|$|R
