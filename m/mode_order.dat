50|$|A common {{example of}} {{longitudinal}} modes are the light wavelengths {{produced by a}} laser. In the simplest case, the laser's optical cavity is formed by two opposed plane (flat) mirrors surrounding the gain medium (a plane-parallel or Fabry-Pérot cavity). The allowed modes of the cavity are those where the mirror separation distance L is equal to an exact multiple of half the wavelength, λ:where q is an integer known as the <b>mode</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{second factor}} to {{determine}} a laser's emission frequencies is the optical cavity (or resonant cavity) of the laser. In the simplest case, this consists of two plane (flat) mirrors facing each other, surrounding the gain medium of the laser (this arrangement {{is known as a}} Fabry-Pérot cavity). Since light is a wave, when bouncing between the mirrors of the cavity, the light will constructively and destructively interfere with itself, leading to the formation of standing waves or modes between the mirrors. These standing waves form a discrete set of frequencies, known as the longitudinal modes of the cavity. These modes are the only frequencies of light which are self-regenerating and allowed to oscillate by the resonant cavity; all other frequencies of light are suppressed by destructive interference. For a simple plane-mirror cavity, the allowed modes are those for which the separation distance of the mirrors L is an exact multiple of half the wavelength of the light λ, such that L [...] qλ/2, where q is an integer known as the <b>mode</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

40|$|Average {{acoustic}} power {{radiation from}} one side of a rectangular cantilever flat plate, vibrating in one of its natural mode under mixed boundary conditions has been investigated. The condition {{at the edges of the}} plate which has been investigated here includes - one end fixed and other three free. Numerical results of the acoustic power radiation by the plates with different sets of values of thickness ratio, aspect ratio and <b>mode</b> <b>orders</b> have been obtained. The characteristic beam functions obtained by Warburton have been used to define the deformation mode of vibrating plates. When a plate with one end fixed and other three free, vibrates in one of its natural modes, acoustic power radiation increases in a regular fashion. But at the higher <b>mode</b> <b>orders</b> it fluctuates maintaining nearly the same average value and the waviness is gradually reduced as the <b>mode</b> <b>orders</b> increases...|$|R
50|$|However, {{all these}} {{considerations}} are better limited to modes of relatively low order. In fact {{it can be}} presumed that the approximation of the non-rigid membrane results less valid {{with the increase of}} the <b>mode</b> <b>order,</b> since the node base tends to become comparable with the thickness of the membrane itself.There are also other considerations. The classic equation of the membrane generally used for obtaining the modes is entirely conservative and {{does not take into account}} either dissipation due to internal friction or irradiation. The latter both being mechanisms that dampen the partials, causing their decay in the absence of an exciting force.A symbolical solution of the equation corresponding to the vibro-acoustic movement described is definitely impossible, even if greatly simplifying hypotheses are adopted. It is possible to solve it with numerical methods (such as FEM, BEM, etc.) but even in this case—if acoustic-elastic coupling and internal dissipations of the membrane are taken into account—the problem remains delicatem, and results must be verified experimentally.However, even in the absence of a solution, it is possible to note that decay of the partials is connected with the merit factor (Q) of their resonance, and provokes a widening of the spectral line—always more marked the more the relative mode is damped. The internal frictions are proportional to the velocity of variation of the local curvature, which increases with the frequency. It can therefore be presumed that, similarly to stretched strings, damping of the modes increases with their frequency. Consequently, in the upper spectral areas, where the modes are close together and massed (see Figs. 9 & 10), the transfer function of the membrane is more continuous than discrete, with moderate peaks on the modal frequencies. In these areas the modes which can be excited are less precisely definable and depend on the loop gain and on the frequency characteristics of the negative feedback electronic circuit. Conversely, the passage from one mode to another of adjacent frequency has little influence on the resultant frequency.Construction of a future improved map for excitation of modes must therefore foresee a judicious choice of the pairs of points which offer the most significant discrimination between modes.In addition, the modal frequencies should be verified experimentally, since it can be presumed that the frequencies of some modes deviate from their nominal values owing to the presence of the actuator with relative wave guide which has a beam width equal to 1/3 of the membrane diameter. The measurement of these deviations cannot be determined reliably with theoretical considerations, since the overall model is too complex and can only be solved (as already shown) with numerical methods.|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} transverse mode (TEM 00) {{is preferable}} for experimental and theoretical {{study on the}} laser-induced retinal injury effect, for it can produce the minimal retinal image and establish the most strict laser safety standards. But actually lasers with higher order mode were frequently used in both earlier and recent studies. Generally higher order mode leads to larger retinal spot size and so higher damage threshold, but there are few quantitative analyses on this problem. In this paper, a four-surface schematic eye model is established for human and macaque. The propagation of 532 -nm laser in schematic eye is analyzed by the ABCD law of Gaussian optics. It is shown that retinal spot size increases with laser transverse <b>mode</b> <b>order.</b> For relative lower <b>mode</b> <b>order,</b> the retinal spot diameter will not exceed the minimum laser-induced retinal lesion (25 ~ 30 μm in diameter), and so has little effect on retinal damage threshold. While for higher order mode, the larger retinal spot requires more energy to induce injury and so the damage threshold increases. When beam divergence is lowered, the retinal spot size decreases correspondingly, so the effect of <b>mode</b> <b>order</b> can be compensated. The retinal spot size of macaque is slightly smaller than that of human and the ratio between them is independent of <b>mode</b> <b>order.</b> We conclude that the laser <b>mode</b> <b>order</b> has significant influence on retinal spot size but limited influence on the retinal injury effect...|$|E

The generated stochastic sound sources closely realize the two-point cross-correlation function proposed by Tam & Auriault to describe the statistics of a fine-scale jet mixing noise source. In a first attempt to extend the prediction capability to 3 -D, a simplified radial scaling function was introduced to use the 2 -D sound sources for axisymmetric computations of azimuthal <b>mode</b> <b>order</b> m= 0. In the current work a strictly derived 3 -D stochastic noise source is introduced, based on an azimuthal mode decomposition. For azimuthal <b>mode</b> <b>order</b> m= 0 clear differences to the previously used simplified scaling model are obtained for sources with small relative distance to the jet axis. The azimuthally decomposed 3 -D stochastic noise sources are shown to be generated by mutually uncorrelated 2 -D stochastic sources for each <b>mode</b> <b>order.</b> Since for jet noise only the first few azimuthal modes are essential to describe the acoustic far-field radiation, a highly efficient 3 -D broadband jet noise model for jet mixing noise is obtained at the computational price of a 2 -D computation.

For the second structure, we alter the n-GaN substrate thickness from 300 - 1000 nm in steps of 100 nm and 1000 - 4000 nm in steps of 1000 nm. These simulations show that increasing the substrate thickness causes the light emitting <b>mode</b> <b>order</b> to increase. The higher the mode, the more current is {{needed to make the}} device emit light. Higher current leads to shorter device lifetime.
