This is especially the case concerning regressive parcel taxes that disproportionately burden single-family homeowners. Before voting on any {{local government}} property tax measure (including any local general obligation bond measure that increases local property taxes to repay the bonds), it is considered a good practice by property owners to review their current property tax bill to get a better picture of the cumulative impact of any property <b>tax</b> measure. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>tax</b> burden issues also arise with respect to regressive sales taxes.

Municipalities that join/create an inter-municipal jurisdiction choose between three tax regimes, which may induce both horizontal and vertical tax externalities.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} flow within a two-stage low-pressure research turbine equipped with high lift profiles {{has been investigated}} in detail for three different aerodynamic loading conditions. Experiments {{have been carried out}} at low speed. Velocity and turbulence intensity in the blade-to-blade plane at midspan have been measured by means of a crossed hot-wire probe, upstream and downstream of each blade row. The probe has been traversed circumferentially over 1. 5 bladings pitch and the phase-locked data acquisition and ensemble average technique have been used to reconstruct the flow in space and time. The effects of multistage configuration have been identified and analyzed by considering the velocity components and turbulence intensity. Potential interaction from the downstream blading in relative motion, periodic wake perturbations from the upstream blading and preceding stage perturbations make the flow in the second stage extremely complex. Overall the flow downstream of rotors is perturbed in space by upstream and downstream stators, while flow downstream of stators is mostly perturbed in time by rotor effects. As expected, high lift profiles are significantly sensitive to incidence variation, with this effect further enhanced by the <b>multistage</b> <b>cumulative</b> interactions...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{issues in the}} {{literature}} on transfer programs for the U.

Empirical work on the issue has reached an impasse partly because the analytic solution to the choice problem is intractable and partly because the model requires the estimation of multiple sets of equations with limited dependent variables, an estimation problem which until recently has been computationally infeasible. In this paper we estimate a model of labor supply and multiple program participation using methods of simulation estimation that enable us to solve both problems. The results show asymmetric wage and tax rate effects, with fairly large wage elasticities of labor supply but very inelastic responses to moderate changes in <b>cumulative</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates, implying that high welfare tax rates do not necessarily induce major reductions in work effort. ...|$|R

The tax policy effect accounts for up to 29 % of the total change in inequality; its contribution increases up to 41 % if we take into account behavioral responses. Using our unique policy effect measure and variation in tax policies across U. S. states and time, we also identify the redistributive intention of policymakers. The estimated effect of partisan politics on the U. S. income distribution is statistically significant and economically important.

We construct a dynamic hypothesis, in which brownfield redevelopment activities are dependent upon funding and in turn bolster tax base through job creation. Drawing on previous studies, barriers to brownfield redevelopment are explored, including fear of liability, regulatory concerns, and uncertain cleanup standards and funding mechanisms. We model {{a case study of}} redevelopment in the State of Michigan (USA), which is informed by data from the Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and U. S.

40|$|Purpose: To analyse {{the impact}} of the Polish fiscal regime on the general revenue of the country, and {{specifically}} to establish whether the <b>cumulative</b> <b>tax</b> burden borne by Polish households is progressive or regressive. Methodology: On the basis of Eurostat and OECD data, the author has analysed fiscal regimes in EU Member States and in OECD countries. The tax burden of households within different income groups has also been examined pursuant to applicable fiscal laws and data pertaining to the revenue and expenditure of households published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). Conclusions: The fiscal regime in Poland is regressive; that is, the relative fiscal burden decreases as the taxpayer’s income increases. Research Implications: The article contributes to the on-going discussion on social cohesion, in particular with respect to economic policy instruments aimed at the redistribution of income within the economy. Originality: The author presents an analysis of data pertaining to fiscal policies in EU Member States and OECD countries and assesses {{the impact of}} the legal environment (fiscal regime and social security system) in Poland on income distribution within the economy.

From 1900 to 1903, the number of white registered voters fell by more than 40,000, although the white population grew overall.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of an online survey of Australian tax {{practitioners}} conducted in May 2014. The purpose of the survey was to gain further insight into how tax changes impact on the role of tax practitioners in assisting their clients to comply with tax obligations (including tax planning). The survey was also designed to identify the possible managerial benefits that business taxpayers may derive from their relationship with a tax practitioner. This article focuses only on the first objective of the survey. The online survey attracted 241 respondents and analysis of the data obtained reveals a number of key findings, some of which are confirmatory. First, respondents see tax planning as almost as important as tax compliance in their role as tax practitioners. As might be expected, the perceived importance of tax planning becomes stronger as firm size becomes larger. Second, respondents consider that the frequent changes to tax rules over the previous five-year period had an adverse impact on their practice {{and the nature of the}} tax services provided to their clients. They also perceive those frequent changes as a main driver of tax complexity. Third, respondents claim that they incur non-trivial annual costs of coping with tax changes and can ultimately pass only a small proportion of these costs to their clients. Fourth, respondents exhibit a largely negative view about the impact of <b>cumulative</b> <b>tax</b> changes over the previous five-year period upon their ability to advise clients with certainty, particularly in relation to tax planning; and upon the time and stress associated with tax return preparation...|$|R

The Texas poll tax “required otherwise eligible voters to pay between $1.50 and $1.75 to register to vote - {{a lot of money}} at the time, and a big barrier to the working classes and poor.” Georgia created a <b>cumulative</b> poll <b>tax</b> requirement in 1877: men of any race 21 to 60 years of age had to pay a sum of money for every year from the time they had turned 21, or from the time that the law took effect.|$|R

40|$|Sources of time-variant {{exposure}} to toxic substances are identified and examined for {{their effects on}} the estimation of response. It is shown that only time-averaged target tissue concentrations are required to obtain rigorous risk estimates from the one-hit and multihit models. In contrast, detailed concentration histories need to be retained throughout analyses involving two-event models with intermediate-stage clonal growth advantage (clonal two-stage) and <b>multistage</b> models. <b>Cumulative</b> incidence ratios, based on the exact to time-averaged treatment of concentration time dependencies, are evaluated for substances whose toxic responses exhibit moderate (arsenic) and strong (ethylene dibromide) dependence on time of actual exposure. These ratios reveal that time-averaged dose approximations may lead to several orders of magnitude error in both the multistage and clonal two-stage models if exposure periods are short, and that 3. 4 -fold (arsenic) and 8 -fold (ethylene dibromide) errors still exist even when an actual two-thirds lifetime exposure is averaged over a full lifetime. Finally, the effects of time-variant exposure on risk estimation due to migration and birth-death in an epidemiological setting are examined. A residence time distribution calculation shows that, if these effects are ignored for a population orally exposed to arsenic and characterized by an out-migration rate in excess of 5 %/yr, response errors will exceed an order of magnitude...|$|R
