40|$|Particle {{separation}} {{is one of}} the fundamental processes in wastewater treatment and a good understanding of the basic separation mechanisms ? sedimentation, flotation and filtration ? is critical in the design of wastewater treatment systems. Upgrading of treatment plants for enhanced primary treatment and effluent polishing are current examples of applications where effective, high-rate separation methods are of interest. Dissolved air flotation (DAF) and <b>microscreening</b> can be used in both applications. The purpose of this work was to study the separation mechanisms in DAF and disc and drum filtration ? referred to as <b>microscreening</b> ? by means of literature studies, particle size analysis and particle visualisation. The processes were studied mainly in the context of applications within tertiary treatment. Furthermore, a novel application based on chemically enhanced primary treatment utilising <b>microscreening</b> for floc removal was tested. Separation efficiency was found to increase with increasing particle size in DAF. Furthermore, particles were preferably separated upstream, i. e. close to the contact zone. Aggregates showed a great variation in rise rates. Relatively small aggregates, with single bubbles attached, showed relatively low rise rates, while large aggregates with numerous bubbles attached showed very high rise rates. Large aggregates rising very quickly could be one explanation of the effective upstream removal of solids. Another explanation could be the bulk flow simply directing flocs to the surface. With particles being separated upstream the straightforward application of the theory of hydraulic surface loading is not necessarily completely valid. With respect to <b>microscreening</b> it was shown that physical blocking of particles was the main separation mechanism. Floc strength and particle size were identified as key parameters in understanding and design of microscreens. Although it is an accepted and known technology, the areas of application of <b>microscreening</b> can be increased. The suitability in floc removal after a post-denitrifying biofilm process, the Kaldnes Moving Bed? Process, was demonstrated. Furthermore, a novel application was introduced where <b>microscreening</b> was used in chemically enhanced primary treatment resulting in high removal rates of SS, BOD, COD and total phosphorus at comparatively high filtration rates...|$|E

Although laboratory tests conducted so far indicate that microscreens can efficiently remove helminth eggs, convincing evidence was missing on the ability of full-scale processes to achieve such objective. This paper presents the results of a demonstration project conducted to validate the efficiency and the reliability of a gravity <b>microscreening</b> filtration process using the Hydrotech Discfilter, with a 10 -μm pore size cloth, as a physical barrier for removing parasitic helminth eggs in full scale water reclamation plants.

About 2 million helminth eggs of the Trichuris suis species were added to reclaimed water (7. 6 m 3 close recirculation system) and subsequently filtered through a Hydrotech Discfilter with 10 -μm pore size cloth. A total of 68 samples of reclaimed water (34 influent samples of 20 L, and 34 effluent samples of 100 L) were analyzed using an adaptation of the Bailenger modified method, as recommended by WHO in “Wastewater analysis for agricultural use” by Ayres & Mara.

40|$|In {{spite of}} their wide {{application}} in comminution circuits, hydrocyclones {{have at least one}} significant disadvantage in that their operation inherently tends to return the fine denser liberated minerals to the grinding mill. This results in unnecessary overgrinding which adds to the milling cost and can adversely affect the efficiency of downstream processes. In an attempt to solve this problem, a three-product cyclone has been developed at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) to generate a second overflow in which the fine dense liberated minerals can be selectively concentrated for further treatment. In this paper, the design and operation of the three-product cyclone are described. The influence of the length of the second vortex finder on the performance of a 150 -mm unit treating a mixture of magnetite and silica is investigated. Conventional cyclone tests were also conducted under similar conditions. Using the operational performance data of the three-product and conventional cyclones, it is shown that by optimising the length of the second vortex finder, the amount of fine dense mineral particles that reports to the three-product cyclone underflow can be reduced. In addition, the three-product cyclone can be used to generate middlings stream that may be more suitable for flash flotation than the conventional cyclone underflow, or alternatively, could be classified with a microscreen to separate the valuables from the gangue. At the same time, a fines stream having similar properties to those of the conventional overflow can be obtained. Hence, if the middlings stream was used as feed for flash flotation or <b>microscreening,</b> the fines stream could be used in lieu of the conventional overflow without compromising the feed requirements for the conventional flotation circuit. Some of the other potential applications of the new cyclone are described. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In addition, this may be required to meet local, state, and regional discharge water quality. The objective of this research was an initial screening of several commercially available polymers routinely used as coagulation–flocculation aids in the drinking and wastewater treatment industry and determination of their effectiveness for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater. Based on the results of the initial screening, a further evaluation of six polymers was conducted to estimate the optimum polymer dosage for flocculation of aquaculture <b>microscreen</b> effluent and overall solids removal efficiency. Results of these evaluations show TSS removal was close to 99 % via settling, with final TSS values ranging from as low as 10 – 17 mg/L. Although not intended to be used for reactive phosphorus (RP) removal, RP was reduced by 92 – 95 % by removing most of the TSS in the wastewater to approximately 1 mg/L–P.

40|$|AbstractAs {{environmental}} regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal practices are increasingly {{more important in}} all types of aquaculture. In many recirculation systems, <b>microscreen</b> filters are used to remove and concentrate the suspended solids from the process water, because they require minimal labor and floor space and can treat large flow rates of water with little head loss. These <b>microscreen</b> filters generate a separate solids waste stream that can be further concentrated to reduce the quantity and {{improve the quality of}} discharge water. A Belt Filter System, Hydrotech Model HBF 537 - 1 H, from Waste Management Technologies Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, USA was evaluated for rapid thickening of sludge from the backwash water of a <b>microscreen</b> filter. When used in conjunction with coagulation/flocculation aids, significant reduction of suspended solid and phosphorus are possible. Testing of the system was conducted using the backwash effluent of a <b>microscreen</b> filter that treated water discharged from several large-scale recirculating aquaculture production systems growing artic char and trout. The system was tested using only alum as the coagulant aid, using only a commercially available polymer as the flocculation aid and the two coagulation/flocculation aids in combination. Alum alone was moderately efficient in removing solids (82 %), but was very efficient in sequestering reactive phosphorus (96 %), with effluent concentrations less than 0. 07 mg/L-P at the highest alum dosage tested, 100 mg/L. Several commercially available polymers used alone and at relatively low dosages (15 mg/L) were very effective in removing suspended solids, with a removal rate averaging 96 % and with an effluent TSS concentration of less than 30 mg/L. The polymers were not as efficient as alum in removing reactive phosphorus, with a removal rate of approximately 40 %. At the optimum combined dosage of alum (mg/L) and polymer (mg/L), the Inclined Belt Filter System increased the dry matter content of the sludge to approximately 13 % solids, and reduced both the suspended solids and reactive phosphorus concentration of the effluent by 95 and 80 %, respectively. The combination of coagulation/flocculation aids and the inclined belt filter show excellent potential to greatly reduce the volume of solids generated, and significantly reduce the concentration of suspended solids and phosphorus in discharged effluents.

Data from four 8 -week studies on ozonation and an 8 -week no ozone control indicated that adding ozone reduced the mean concentration of TSS by 35 %, COD by 36 %, DOC by 17 %, and color by 82 % within the water entering the culture tanks. Additionally, ozone reduced the mean nitrite concentration by 82 % within the culture tanks. Adding ozone did not affect turbidity. Changes brought on by ozonation, particularly as it affected the characteristics of the suspended solids, also improved suspended solids removal across the TriangelTM filter by an average of 33 %. In addition, adding ozone decreased plugging of the <b>microscreen</b> filter panels, as indicated by an average of 35 % fewer filter wash cycles, 53 % less filter sludge flow produced, and 79 % more settled solids volume in the TriangelTM filter effluents.

The Rya WWTP has recently been upgraded with <b>microscreens</b> {{in the form of}} disc filters. Extensive characterisation of the wastewater from different locations in the plant (influent, after primary settling) and secondary settler effluent, was performed to increase the understanding of the potential of removing different components from the wastewater. The wastewater was fractionated by filtration through filter cloths with pore sizes 40, 20, 15, and 10 µm and through finer filters with pore size 1. 2, 0. 45, 0. 2 and 0. 1 µm. Particle size analysis (PSA) was used to assess the removal efficiency of the filter cloths. High removal degrees were achieved were particles larger or equal in size to the pore size were strained. Some floc break-up took place leading to an increased number of small particles (1 - 5 µm) after filtration. The suspended solids concentration could be reduced to 1 mg/l with total phosphorus concentrations of < 0. 2 mg/l. Some removal of metals could be observed when filtering wastewater with higher concentrations (influent and secondary settler effluent) whereas no effect could be seen for the effluent wastewater, probably due to the low concentrations present.

The flow through the culture tank was 4500 – 4800 L/min. Approximately 92 – 93 % of the system flow exited through the Cornell-type sidewall drain. The remaining 7 – 8 % of the flow, approximately 340 L/min, exited through a bottom–center drain and an external standpipe {{and then to the}} settling tank. The surface-loading rate applied to both settling tank designs was 0. 0031 m 3 /s per square meter (4. 6 gpm/ft 2) of settling area. The swirl separator and the radial-flow settler were evaluated over a range of feeding rates to evaluate the relationship between inlet TSS concentration and TSS removal efficiency. There was a highly significant difference (P< 0. 001) in mean TSS removal efficiency of the swirl separator and radial-flow settler, (±S. E.) 37. 1 ± 3. 3 % and 77. 9 ± 1. 6 %, respectively. Also, TSS removal efficiency of the radial-flow settler was less variable than removal efficiency of the swirl separator. The trend in TSS removal efficiency was consistent over a broad range of inlet TSS concentrations to the separator. A mass balance indicates that the swirl separator only removed approximately 23 % of the total mass of TSS removed from this recirculating system. However, when the radial-flow settler was operated in the same recirculating system, it accounted for approximately 48 % of the mass of TSS removed from the system daily. The mass balance calculations also indicate that the <b>microscreen</b> drum filter accounted for approximately 40 – 45 % of the mass of TSS removed daily from the recirculating system when using either settling device. In either case, these results indicate that drum filter treatment of the entire recirculating flow {{played an important role in}} preventing elevated TSS concentrations from accumulating within a recirculating system...|$|R

The investigations included the production of both surfactant and particle-stabilized emulsions. The average droplet size was found to decrease when both the oscillation frequency and amplitude was increased. For surfactant-stabilized emulsions, using bi-surfactants in both the continuous and dispersed phases resulted in a smaller droplet size due to lower interfacial tension. For particle-stabilized emulsions, both the hydrodynamics of the system and the hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of the stabilizing particles influenced the interfacial properties at the oil–water interface, which in turn affected the final droplet size and distribution with potential droplet breakage. In absence of the latter, a simple torque balance model can be used to reasonably predict the average emulsion droplet size...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background HIV, HBV and HCV pose a {{major public}} health problem {{throughout}} the world. Detection of infection markers for these agents is a major challenge for testing laboratories in a resource poor setting. As blood transfusion is an important activity saving millions of live every year, it also carries a risk of transfusion transmissible infections caused by these fatal blood borne pathogens if the quality of testing is compromised. Conventional ELISA {{is regarded as the}} mostly used screening technique but due to limitations like high cost, unavailability in many blood banks and testing sites, involvement of costly instruments, time taking nature and requirement of highly skilled personnel for interpretation, rapid tests are gaining more importance and warrants comparison of performance. Results A comparative study between these two techniques has been performed using commercially available diagnostic kits to assess their efficacy for detection of HIV, HBV and HCV infections. Rapid kits were more efficient in specificity with synthetic antigens along with high PPV than ELISA in most cases. Comparison between different ELISA kits revealed that Microlisa HIV and Hepalisa (J. Mitra & Co. Pvt. Ltd.); ERBA LISA HIV 1 + 2, ERBA LISA Hepatitis B and ERBA LISA HCV (Transasia Bio-medicals Ltd.) gives uniform result with good performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and efficiency, whereas, Microlisa HCV (J.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a high and low non-starch {{polysaccharide}} diet (HNSP and LNSP diet) and ultrasound treatment on particle size distribution and carbon bioavailability in fecal waste of rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss) was studied. Feces were collected from four flow-through fish tanks, two tanks fed the HNSP diet and two the LNSP diet. The collected feces were sonicated (disintegrated) in duplicate with high-intensity (0. 6 W/ml), low-frequency (f = 20 Hz) ultrasound at five different energy levels (0. 6 W/ml for 0, 0. 25, 1, 4, and 16 min). The particle size distribution of the treated feces samples was measured by wet sieving (1000, 500, 200, 100, 63, 36, 1. 2 µm screen size) and total suspended solids (TSS) measurement. Carbon bioavailability in sonicated fecal waste samples was determined with oxygen uptake rate (OUR) tests. The results showed that: (1) feces from the HNSP diet contained significant more particulate material and bigger particles; (2) carbon bioavailability was almost three times higher in untreated LNSP feces when compared with HNSP feces; (3) almost 50 % of HNSP feces could have been recovered on a <b>microscreen</b> of 36 µm after wet sieving, whereas it was only 10 % for LNSP feces; (4) the production of small particles (1. 2 – 36 µm), which could pass a drum filter screen and potentially accumulate in RAS, was approximately 50 g/kg feed, showing {{no significant differences between}} diets; (5) sonication increased fecal dry matter below 36 µm (p = 0. 015), but it had no significant effect on the median particle size; (6) sonication increased carbon bioavailability with 7 – 10 % for the HNSP feces (p = 0. 037); (7) fecal particles withstood up to 16 min sonication at an intensity of 0. 6 W/ml and a frequency of 20 Hz corresponding to specific energy input of 20, 000 kJ/kg DM without major changes in particle size distribution. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the applied ultrasound treatment of fecal waste is not an effective method to increase short-term carbon bioavailability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{recirculating}} aquaculture system (RAS) can minimize water use, allowing fish {{production in}} regions where water is scarce and also placing the waterborne wastes into a concentrated and relatively small volume of effluent. The RAS effluent generated during clarifier backwash is usually small in volume (possibly 0. 2 – 0. 5 % of the total recirculating flow when <b>microscreen</b> filters are used) but contains high levels of concentrated organic solids and nutrients. When a RAS is operated at high salinities for culture of marine species, recovering the saltwater contained in the backwash effluent could allow for its reuse within the RAS and also reduce salt discharge to the environment. Membrane biological reactors (MBRs) combine activated sludge type treatment with membrane filtration. Therefore, in addition to removing biodegradable organics, suspended solids, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, MBRs retain high concentrations of microorganisms and, when operated with membrane pore sizes < 1 μm, exclude microorganisms from their discharge. In this research, an Enviroquip (Austin, TX) MBR pilot-plant was installed and evaluated over a range of salinities to determine its effectiveness at removing bacteria, turbidity, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and cBOD 5 content from the approximately 22 m 3 /day concentrated biosolids backwash flow discharged from the RASs at The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute. The MBR system was managed at a hydraulic retention time of 40. 8 h, a solids retention time of 64 ± 8 days, resulting in a Food: Microorganism ratio of 0. 029 day− 1. Results indicated excellent removal efficiency (%) of TSS (99. 65 ± 0. 1 to 99. 98 ± 0. 01) and TVS (99. 96 ± 0. 01 to 99. 99 ± 0. 0) at all salinity levels. Similarly, a 3 – 4 log 10 removal of total heterotrophic microbes and total coliform was seen at all treatment conditions. Total nitrogen removal efficiency (%) ranged from 91. 8 ± 2. 9 to 95. 5 ± 0. 6 at the treatment levels and was consistent, provided a sufficient acclimation period to each new condition was given. Conversely, total phosphorus removal efficiencies (%) at 0 ppt, 8 ppt, 16 ppt and 32 ppt salinity were 96. 1 ± 1. 0, 72. 7 ± 3. 5, 70. 4 ± 2. 3, and 65. 2 ± 5. 4, respectively, indicating reduced phosphorus removal at higher salinities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWastes {{contained}} in the <b>microscreen</b> backwash discharged from intensive recirculating aquaculture systems were removed and dewatered in simple geotextile bag filters. Three chemical coagulation aids (aluminum sulfate (alum), ferric chloride, and calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime)), were tested in combination with a long-chain polymer flocculation aid (HyChem CE 1950 at 25 mg/L) to determine the most cost effective and efficient treatment combination. Three different coagulants were tested to determine if coagulant choice impacts nutrient and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (cBOD 5) leaching into the filtrate and the final composition of the bag-captured biosolids {{at the end of}} each period. If nutrient leaching into the bag filtrate could be minimized through coagulant selection, then geotextile bags could provide a convenient and effective method to dewater waste biosolids and provide them in a form that fish farmers could readily transport, store, or send for disposal. Results from replicate geotextile bag filter tests indicate that when alum, ferric chloride, and hydrated lime (plus a polymer) were amended to a backwash flow, both suspended solids capture and solids thickening were improved; i. e., total suspended solids removal rates of 95. 8, 95. 1, and 96. 0 %, respectively, were achieved along with final dewatered filter cake percent solids concentrations of 22. 1, 19. 3, and 20. 9 %, respectively. Alum, ferric chloride, and hydrated lime (plus a polymer) amended geotextile bags were not as effective in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and cBOD 5 removal, resulting in removal rates of 69. 6, 67. 2, and 35. 3 %, respectively, and 56. 6, 9. 3, and − 47. 4 %, respectively. Further, the use of lime as a coagulant resulted in filtrate COD and cBOD 5 concentrations that exceeded inlet concentrations. Total nitrogen removal applying alum, ferric chloride, and lime were also less than effective, resulting in removal rates of 39. 1, 46. 7, and − 8. 9 %, respectively. Filtrate total nitrogen concentrations were primarily in the inorganic form (total ammonia nitrogen) suggesting mineralization of ammonia as solids were stored within geotextile bags under anaerobic conditions. Alum, ferric chloride, and lime amended bags were moderately efficient at total phosphorus removal, resulting in removal rates of 67. 6, 47. 0, and 77. 3 %, respectively. Alum was identified as the most cost effective chemical for coagulation, but hydrated lime was the most effective at dissolved phosphorus precipitation and removal...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{overfishing}} {{of global}} fish stocks and increasing fish meal prices, plant ingredients are being increasingly {{used as an}} alternative source of protein in fish feeds. However, the inclusion of unpurified plant ingredients will also increase the content of fibers in feeds. Fibers are nearly indigestible and will therefore increase solid waste production in aquaculture. This solid waste {{can be used to}} as a carbon source for denitrification to control nitrate levels in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), thereby reducing both solid and dissolved waste production. Additionally, fibers can change the recovery characteristics and lower the degradability of fecal waste. Therefore, this study investigates how changes in the dietary carbohydrate composition can affect waste production, system performance and denitrification in RAS. Furthermore, ultrasound treatment (to decrease particle size in fecal waste) and enzymatic conditioning (to increase fiber degradability) were tested as possible means to increase the bioavailability of carbon in fecal waste for denitrification. Comparing a high fiber (HNSP) and low fiber (LNSP) diet in RAS stocked with rainbow trout confirmed that the fibers in the HNSP diet increase fecal waste production. Although the HNSP diet produced more fecal waste than the LNSP diet, both diets produced the same amount of biodegradable fecal carbon. Since feces removal was higher in RAS using the HNSP diet, the load of degradable organic matter on the biofilters was lower with the HNSP diet than with the LNSP diet. Furthermore, fecal waste produced with the HNSP diet contained larger particles than feces of the LNSP diet, which could also improve the recovery of fecal waste with <b>microscreens.</b> Feces produced with the HNSP diet were also less degradable than feces produced with the LNSP diet. By using fecal waste as an internal carbon source for denitrification, solid and dissolved waste emissions from RAS could be reduced by ~ 50 % for the HNSP diet. However, only approximately half of the supplied cellulose and hemicellulose were degraded in the denitrification reactors, whereas lignin was not degraded at all. Thus, the overall degradability of organic carbon in fecal waste was limited by fibers as hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Ultrasound and enzymatic conditioning did not sufficiently increase the degradability of fecal waste. Nonetheless, fibers originating from unpurified plant ingredients may also have beneficial effects on RAS performance by increasing fecal recovery. A more selective choice of feed ingredients could be used to increase the recovery and degradability of fecal waste in RAS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA model partial-reuse {{system is}} {{described}} that provides {{an alternative to}} salmonid production in serial-reuse raceway systems and has potential application in other fish-culture situations. The partial-reuse system contained three 10 m 3 circular ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain culture tanks. The side-wall discharge from the culture tanks was treated across a <b>microscreen</b> drum filter, then the water was pumped {{to the head of}} the system where dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) stripping and pure oxygen (O 2) supplementation took place before the water returned to the culture tanks. Dilution with make-up water controlled accumulations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). An automatic pH control system that modulated the stripping column fan ‘on’ and ‘off’ was used to limit the fractions of CO 2 and unionized ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 N). The partial-reuse system was evaluated during the culture of eight separate cohorts of advanced fingerlings, i. e., Arctic char, rainbow trout, and an all female brook trout × Arctic char hybrid. The fish performed well, even under intensive conditions, which were indicated by dissolved O 2 consumption across the culture tank that went as high as 13 mg/L and fish-culture densities that were often between 100 and 148 kg/m 3. Over all cohorts, feed conversion rates ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 3, specific growth rates (SGR) ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 45 % body weight per day, and thermal growth coefficients ranged from 0. 00132 to 0. 00218. The partial-reuse system maintained safe water quality in all cases except for the first cohort—when the stripping column fan failed. The ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain tank was found to rapidly (within only 1 – 2 min) and gently concentrate and flush approximately 68 – 88 % (79 % overall average) of the TSS produced daily within only 12 – 18 % of the tank’s total water flow. Mean TSS concentrations discharged through the three culture tanks’ bottom-center drains (average of 17. 1 mg/L) was 8. 7 times greater than the TSS concentration discharged through the three culture tanks’ side-wall drains (average of 2. 2 mg/L). Overall, approximately 82 % of the TSS produced in the partial-reuse system was captured in an off-line settling tank, which is better TSS removal than others have estimated for serial-reuse systems (approximately 25 – 50 %). For the two cohorts of rainbow trout, the partial-reuse system sustained a production level of 35 – 45 kg per year of fish for every 1 L/min of make-up water, which is approximately six to seven times greater than the typical 6 kg per year of trout produced for every 1 L/min of water in Idaho serial-reuse raceway systems...|$|R
40|$|Electronic imaging {{systems such}} as image {{rendering}} and printing devices are providing higher quality with improved technologies. Physical hardware limitation has been pushed to a newer level. By utilizing some of these new imaging technologies, three improvements are presented in this document, including banding reduction using pulse width modulation, multitoning using DBS screens, and hybrid screen design. ^ In Ch. 1, we propose a system to reduce electrophotographic laser printer banding artifacts due to optical photoconductor drum velocity fluctuations. The drum velocity fluctuations are sensed with an optical encoder mounted on the drum axis. Based on the line-to-line differential encoder count, we modulate the laser pulse width to compensate fluctuations in development that would otherwise occur. We present {{an analysis of the}} system, including the compensation algorithm that determines the desired pulse-width as a function of differential encoder count. Characterization of the system is based on printing, scanning, and processing a special test page that yields information about line-spacing and absorptance fluctuations. This data is synchronized with the encoder count signal that was recorded during the printing of the test page. The experimental results show the efficacy of the system. ^ In Ch. 2, we propose a methodology for multilevel screen design using Direct Binary Search. We define a multitone schedule, which for each absorptance level specifies the fraction of each native tone used in the multitone cell. Based on the multitone schedule, multitone patterns are designed level-by-level by adding native tones under the stacking constraint. At each level, the spatial arrangement of the native tones is determined by a modified DBS search. We explore several different multitone schedules that illustrate the image quality tradeoffs in multitone screen design. ^ In Ch. 4, we propose a screen design method that generates a new hybrid class of halftones [...] -stochastic dispersed-dot in highlights and periodic clustered-dot in midtones. The traditional solution for generating hybrid halftones is the so-called supercell technique. While maintaining the spatial resolution, supercell increases the number of the output levels of a periodic micro-clustered-dot screen by adding dots asynchronously based on the order described in a dispersed-dot macroscreen. The traditional supercell screen employs a Bayer macroscreen and consequently results in visible false textures in highlight area. Simply replacing the Bayer macroscreen with a stochastic macroscreen yields the maze-like artifact due to the embedded upsampling process. In this work, we propose a screen design method which optimizes the employed multiple macroscreens and <b>microscreens</b> simultaneously using DBS. The resulting final screen is decomposable for a memory-efficient implementation. We also propose an adaptive microcell-based edge enhancement algorithm for further improvement. Several results are demonstrated using the proposed screens. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of hydrochemical heterogeneities in groundwater systems is an indispensible tool {{to obtain information}} about chemical stratifications within an aquifer, and {{to gain a better}} understanding of natural weathering processes, hydrochemical evolution paths, and contaminant transport. Furthermore, it is highly topical since a detailed knowledge about the three-dimensional distribution of chemical groundwater composition is supposed to provide an important means for investigating the effects of a changing environment (climate change, changes in land use, population growth, and the effects of increasing human activities). However, an everlasting issue in hydrogeological studies lies in the limited vertical representativeness of groundwater samples obtained from production wells or conventional observation wells. Samples obtained from longer screened intervals can unwontedly blur the actual hydrochemical zoning and heterogeneity within an aquifer. In order to obtain more reliable information on the vertical distribution of solute concentrations and groundwater quality parameters, the use of an appropriate multilevel sampling technique can be the optimal choice. The {{investigation of}} point water samples collected at one to two meters distances rather than samples from longer screened intervals enables for the acquisition of detailed vertical profiles of groundwater chemistry. However, the benefits of obtaining this advanced level of detailedness are contingent on the minimization of vertical cross contaminations between the different samples, and the effectiveness of a multilevel sampling installation is thus based on the premise of only negligible vertical flow contributions. Many different multi level water sampling systems have been proposed in hydrogelogical sciences. However, the suitability of a specific multilevel sampler design is strongly dependent upon the intended application and local requirements. Example given, in formerly glaciated regions like Scandinavia many of the most important groundwater resources are situated in glaciofluvial sediments, which are commonly characterised by a high degree of heterogeneity (very coarse to very fine material). This significantly reduces the number of suitable drilling techniques and imposes several restrictions with regard to the connection of filter elements to the surrounding aquifer, and the vertical isolation between the different sampling levels (hole seal quality and vertical flows). Another important mater is the general ease and the cost of installation (which clearly depends on the local availability of certain drilling techniques and services, and the availability of material for well construction). We summarize our experiences gained by using various setups of small volume multi-level samplers with <b>microscreens</b> in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers at two different experimental sites in S-Norway. Experiments were conducted during year 2010 and 2011 in fine to coarse grained glaciofluvial deposits in the eastern part of the Gardermoen / Øvre Romerike Aquifer (Ullensaker), and in coarse grained glaciofluvial deposits at the Granli waterworks (Kongsvinger). Installations were performed using different drilling techniques (5 / 4 inch Pionjär handheld drilling equipment, geotechnical drilling rig percussion drilling, and 163 mm ODEX drilling). Samples were extracted by using a multi channel peristaltic suction pump under low flow rates. The suitability of different types of tubing and filter materials has been investigated by checking for unwanted leaching of inorganic compounds. JRC. H. 2 -Air and Climat...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} change the precipitation behaviour causing either extreme wet- or dry weather. This impacts the fresh water supply for clean water production. Evides B. V., one of the Dutch water companies, anticipates to these changes with the sewer mining concept called ‘RINEW’ (Rotterdam Innovative Nutrients and Energy Watermanagement). RINEW studies various ways to recover valuable substances in direct decentralized sewage treatment. The treatment scheme involves the pre-treatment <b>microscreen,</b> coagulation and ceramic Microfiltration (cMF) for the water purification step Reverse Osmosis (RO). Since the application of cMF for sewage treatment is a novel concept, the objective of present thesis is to gain insight into technical aspects of cMF (a cMF fouling indicator and effect of oxygen on RO biofouling) and potential financial feasibility of the RINEW concept in the Netherlands. To study the potential of a fouling indicator for the cMF, irreversible fouling rates and feed water quality results are obtained over a two month period. The feed water quality is digitally monitored and characterized on COD, NTU and EC. The parameter ‘COD’ (chemical oxygen demand) is considered the most suitable as fouling indicator due to the relative large particle size of organic matter and sticky properties of biopolymers. Relating the fouling rates to the feed water quality results in a linear trend where higher irreversible fouling rates occur at higher COD concentrations. Yet, the trend result is scattered significantly since the operational flux was highly instable over time. The feed pump is originally designed for a Nanofiltration (NF) application which may explain the deviant cMF operation. The effect of oxygen in cMF permeate is studied on the (bio) fouling development on spiral wound Reverse Osmosis (RO). The study is done in duplicate each time using two parallel Membrane Fouling Simulator (MFS) which are fed by cMF permeate. In one MFS setup the water is depleted from oxygen by adding Sodium Bisulfite (NaHSO 3). The pressure drop results in the MFS fed by aerobic water indicate a significant unstable fouling rate. The fouling rates obtained from the MFS fed by oxygen depleted water compare to similar studies done with NF permeate and tap water. This suggest a significant stable RO biofouling can be obtained if Sodium Bisulfite treatment is applied to RO feed water. The potential financial feasibility is studied via a concept study. Concept 1 is the RINEW concept providing high quality water (e. g. demi water) to an industry. Since it is a sewer mining concept the water transport costs are neglected. In concept 2 an equal high quality water flow is produced from secondary effluent by a MF/UF+RO combination at a central Sewage Treatment Plant (SWTP). The water transport from the central SWTP to the industry is {{taken into account in}} concept 2. The difference in specific costs [EURm- 3] between the two concepts is estimated which is recalculated into a breakeven the high quality water transport distance of approximately 20 km. In other words, if an industry demands high quality water and sewage is the only water source, concept 2 is more financial feasible within a range of 20 km from a SWTP. In relation to the Netherlands the SWTP density is discussed as too high for the RINEW concept to be financial feasible. Similar realized treatment plants in the Netherlands show higher importance to aspects like water source, current expertise and existing facilities in the decision-making of treatment plant.
