40|$|OBJECTIVE: The blood {{pressure}} (BP) rise on awakening (morning surge) {{might be a}} predictor of hypertension-related cardiovascular complications. Previous {{studies suggest that the}} autonomic nervous system may contribute to the early <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> increase. We tested the hypothesis that resting sympathetic outflow [assessed by direct measures of intraneural sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) ] may help predict the <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge in hypertension. METHODS: We measured muscle SNA (MSNA), heart rate (HR) and BP during undisturbed supine rest in 68 newly diagnosed untreated hypertensive patients (53 men and 15 women, age 40  ±  3 years, BMI 27  ±  1  kg/m(2), mean ± SEM). The <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge was defined as the difference between the <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> and the pre-awake BP. RESULTS: SBP averaged 143  ±  3  mmHg for daytime and 126  ±  2  mmHg for night-time. Mean HR was 81  ±  2  beats/min for daytime and 69  ±  2  beats/min for night-time. Average MSNA was 32  ±  2  bursts/min., SBP morning surge 19  ±  2  mmHg and HR morning surge 14  ±  2  beats/min. In univariate analysis, MSNA correlated with daytime SBP (r =  0. 28, P =  0. 02); night-time SBP (r =  0. 26, P =  0. 03); daytime HR (r =  0. 28, P =  0. 02); and night-time HR (r =  0. 26, P =  0. 03). Multivariate analysis, taking into consideration age, BMI and sex, revealed that MSNA was independently related to both daytime (P =  0. 006) and night-time HR (P =  0. 02), but not to ambulatory SBP. The morning surge of SBP and HR was not related to MSNA (r =  0. 01 and r =  0. 07, respectively, P = NS).

Patients and methods: Two studies were done concurrently to investigate the effects of switching from two different ARBs to olmesartan. Patients prescribed candesartan (8 mg once daily in the morning) or telmisartan (40 mg once daily in the morning) for 16 weeks were switched to olmesartan (20 mg once daily in the morning) for 16 weeks. Then, they were switched back to candesartan (CO group) or telmisartan (TO group) for another 16 weeks. Results: Data from all patients in the CO group (n= 165) and the TO group (n= 152) were analyzed. Clinic and <b>morning</b> home <b>BP</b> and urinary albumin levels showed a significant decrease from baseline at 16 weeks after switching to olmesartan in both the CO and the TO group (clinic <b>BP,</b> <b>morning</b> home diastolic <b>BP,</b> and urinary albumin, P< 0. 05; <b>morning</b> home systolic <b>BP,</b> P< 0. 01).

Our aim was to define outcome-driven thresholds for increased day-to-day home BP variability. We studied a population-based sample of 6238 individuals (mean age 60. 0 ± 12. 9, 56. 4 % women) from Japan, Greece, and Finland. All participants self-measured their home BP on ≥ 3 days. We defined home BP variability as the coefficient of variation of the first <b>morning</b> <b>BPs</b> on 3 to 7 days. We assessed the association between systolic/diastolic BP variability (as a continuous variable and in deciles of coefficient of variation) and cardiovascular outcomes using Cox regression models adjusted for cohort and classical cardiovascular risk factors, including BP. During a follow-up of 9. 3 ± 3. 6 years, 304 cardiovascular deaths and 715 cardiovascular events occurred. A 1 SD increase in systolic/diastolic home BP variability was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 17 / 1. 22; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 06 - 1. 30 / 1. 11 - 1. 34; P= 0. 003 / 11. 0 / 12. 8). Increased home BP variability predicts cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. Individuals with a systolic/diastolic coefficient of variation of day-to-day home BP > 11. 0 / 12. 8 may have {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may affect the normal overnight fall in blood pressure {{more so than the}} average diurnal figure. The aspect of OSA responsible for higher BP is far from clear, possibilities being hypoxia, sleep disturbance or increased inspiratory effort. This abstract reports an interim analysis from a community survey of 326 randomly selected men and women aged 35 - 65 addressing this issue. Following random selection from a GP practice's patient records, subjects were visited at home by a specially trained nurse. Husbands and wives were usually studied on the same occasion. Questionnaires were administered and anthropometric measurements made. BPs were measured with an automatic device three times by the nurse, three times by the subject themselves (after instruction), and again three times the following morning by the subject immediately on arousal. Overnight recordings were made using the RM 50 recorder (SaO 2, snoring (throat microphone), posture, heart rate, thoracic movement, and indirect beat to beat blood pressure (pulse transit time)). These data were processed to give > 4 %SaO 2 dip rate, snores/hr, mean inspiratory effort across the night (pulsus paradoxus), and autonomic (blood pressure) 'arousals'/hr. The difference between the <b>morning</b> and evening <b>BP</b> measured by the subjects was calculated. The relationship between <b>morning</b> to evening <b>BP</b> change and potential predictors was explored using linear modelling (SAS), any non-normally distributed data was logged first. Evening to <b>morning</b> systolic <b>BP</b> change averaged - 9. 5 mmHg (95 th centiles, - 32 to + 11).

40|$|RATIONALE: To {{establish}} {{a new approach to}} investigate the physiological effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and to evaluate novel treatments, during a period of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) withdrawal. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of CPAP withdrawal. METHODS: Forty-one patients with OSA and receiving CPAP were randomized to either CPAP withdrawal (subtherapeutic CPAP), or continued CPAP, for 2 weeks. Polysomnography, sleepiness, psychomotor performance, endothelial function, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), urinary catecholamines, blood markers of systemic inflammation, and metabolism were assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CPAP withdrawal led to a recurrence of OSA within a few days and a return of subjective sleepiness, but was not associated with significant deterioration of psychomotor performance within 2 weeks. Endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilatation, decreased significantly in the CPAP withdrawal group compared with therapeutic CPAP (mean difference in change, - 3. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], - 4. 5, - 1. 9 %; P < 0. 001). Compared with continuing CPAP, 2 weeks of CPAP withdrawal was associated with a significant increase in <b>morning</b> systolic <b>BP</b> (mean difference in change, + 8. 5 mm Hg; 95 % CI, + 1. 7, + 15. 3 mm Hg; P = 0. 016), <b>morning</b> diastolic <b>BP</b> (mean difference in change, + 6. 9 mm Hg; 95 % CI, + 1. 9, + 11. 9 mm Hg; P = 0. 008), and morning HR (mean difference in change, + 6. 3 bpm, 95 % CI, + 0. 4, + 12. 2 bpm; P = 0. 035). CPAP withdrawal was associated with an increase in urinary catecholamines but did not lead to an increase in markers of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, or blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP withdrawal usually leads to a rapid recurrence of OSA, a return of subjective sleepiness, and is associated with impaired endothelial function, increased urinary catecholamines, blood pressure, and heart rate.

40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} {{the value of}} different blood pressure (BP) measurement methods for arterial hypertension (HT) chronotherapy efficacy assessment. Material and methods. Two similar open, randomized, cross-over studies (morning vs evening intake) were carried out. Duration of the initial wash-out period was 2 weeks; duration of both treatment courses — 3 weeks; the interval between courses — 1 week. Only patients with stable HT (mean day-time BP> 135 / 85 mm Hg) were included. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was carried out prior to treatment {{and at the end}} of both treatment courses. The patients performed home BP monitoring (HBPM) throughout the study. Pharmacokinetics of verapamil (n= 14, mean daily dose — 240. 0 ± 16. 3 mg) was studied to assess compliance with verapamil therapy. In ramipril trial (n= 30) its mean daily dose was 8. 9 ± 0. 7 mg. The following main ABPM variables were analyzed: ABPM means and variability, maximal and minimal values, nocturnal BP fall, parameters of Fourier transformation and smoothness index. The morning and evening BP means and <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge (morning – evening BP) were assessed by HBPM. Student’s t-value and Mahalanobis distance were used to evaluate individual value of each variable (“morning” vs “evening” effect). This analysis was first done separately for each trial. After that, combined data were analyzed. Results. Overall antihypertensive effect was more intense with morning ramipril (p< 0. 05) intake and evening verapamil intake. The t-values ranged 2. 2 - 2. 3 for nocturnal BP fall; 2. 0 - 2. 1 for night-time BP variability; 3. 8 - 4. 3 for <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge.

40|$|Most {{cardiovascular}} functions exhibit circadian changes. On one hand, predictable-in-time {{differences in}} the physiological status of the cardiovascular system give rise to rhythmic variations in the susceptibility to morbid and mortal events. On the other, the pathological mechanisms of cardiovascular disease exhibit temporal changes in both their manifestation and severity, leading to predictable-in-time {{differences in the}} ability to precipitate the overt expression of disease. It is known that the occurrence of cardiovascular events shows temporal patterns that vary with time. The incidence of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular events, e. g. acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, sudden cardiac death, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and rupture or dissection of aortic aneurysms, displays a diurnal pattern, tending to be higher in the morning. On arousal and the start of daily activities, blood pressure (BP) shows a surge that may last 4 - 6 h. <b>Morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge, together with circadian variations in biochemical and physiological parameters, may be potential triggers for acute cardiovascular events.

40|$|Hypertension affects {{approximately}} 36 million {{individuals in}} Japan. As the population ages, {{the prevalence of}} hypertension will increase even further unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented. The higher the blood pressure (BP), the greater the chance of cardiovascular disease. We overviewed here recent clinical studies which provided evidence supporting the recent several new guidelines for hypertension prevention and management. We focus on progress made in chronotherapy based on a chronodiagnosis. Home blood pressure (HBP) has become quite popular in recent years, offering a number of advantages {{from the viewpoint of}} both diagnosis and treatment. One basis of superiority rests on the fact that clinic BP is not representative of BP values outside the clinic. The overshadowing major and unique benefit to be derived stems from a chronobiologic interpretation of HBP monitoring, the ability to observe the acceptability or unacceptability of BP variations in the normal range throughout the day, week, month and year. The <b>morning</b> surge of <b>BP</b> may trigger a number of cardiovascular events, but this is a population phenomenon that has to be individualized and further qualified by population rhythms with frequencies other than circadian. For the purpose of individualization, it should be recognized that BP monitoring for only office is not sufficient for a reliable diagnosis and for providing adequate treatment recommendations to prevent adverse vascular events, because abnormality can be there on some days but not on others. Regarding the evaluation of the treatment, HBP (and heart rate) offers several advantages. One is the possibility of evaluating the duration of efficacy of the current antihypertensive non-drug or drug treatment. When a long-acting antihypertensive drug is administered once in the <b>morning,</b> the <b>BP</b> in the evening corresponds to near the peak effect. Recently, the ratio of morning effect versus evening effect has been used as an indicator of the duration of action of the antihypertensive effect, the morning versus evening (M/E) ratio. This concept is derived from the trough versus peak (T/P) ratio obtained from ambulatory BP monitoring. The T/P ratio is an approach proposed for assessing the homogeneity of the antihypertensive treatment. Such homeostatically devised pharmacotherapy may, however, not be optimal to adequately treat diseases, which vary in risk and severity along the scale of 24 hours. New technology makes chronotherapy possible by increasing the efficacy and safety of medications, by proportioning their concentrations during the week (by HBP) in synchrony with chronome alterations of disease. Such chronotherapy is likely to bring more opportunities for preventing adverse outcomes in the future. With chronobiologic methods applicable to the individual patient, a chronotherapy based on a chronodiagnosis for "prehabilitation" may save much of the cost and may overcome the limitations to rehabilitation, e. g., after a massive stroke...|$|R
40|$|Background: Morning blood {{pressure}} (BP) surge, which exhibits an age-related increase, {{is a risk}} factor for stroke in elderly hypertensive patients, independently of the 24 -h BP level. We studied the effect of the new baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) -restoring Ca-channel blocker (CCB) azelnidipine (AZ) on this age-related <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> increase. Methods: We conducted a 16 -week prospective study to clarify the effect of morning dosing of AZ on home BPs measured in the morning and in the evening in 2, 546 hypertensive patients (mean age, 65. 1 years; female, 53. 6 %). Results: At baseline, ME-Dif (morning systolic BP [SBP]–evening SBP) increased with age, independently of ME-Ave (average of the morning and evening SBPs). This age-related increase of ME-Dif was exaggerated by regular alcohol drinking and beta-blocker use. After AZ treatment (14. 3 ± 3. 6 mg/day), ME-AV and ME-Dif were significantly reduced independently of each other, with reductions of – 18. 1 ± 15. 6 and – 2. 5 ± 13. 2 mmHg, respectively (both p < 0. 001). AZ treatment decreased age-related increase in ME-Dif particularly in patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and in beta-blocker users.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether reductions in morning systolic blood pressure (BP) elicited by treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in heart failure (HF) patients are associated with a reduction in sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. BackgroundDaytime muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is elevated in HF patients with coexisting OSA. In our recent randomized trial in HF, abolition of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and lowered <b>morning</b> systolic <b>BP.</b> MethodsMuscle sympathetic nerve activity, BP, and heart rate (HR) of medically treated HF patients (EF < 45 %) and OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 20 /h of sleep) were recorded on the morning after overnight polysomnography, and again one month after patients were randomly allocated nocturnal CPAP treatment or no CPAP (control). ResultsIn nine control patients, there were no significant changes in the severity of OSA, MSNA, systolic BP, or HR. In contrast, in the 8 CPAP-treated patients, OSA was attenuated, and there were significant reductions in daytime MSNA (from 58 ± 4 bursts/min to 48 ± 5 bursts/min; 84 ± 4 bursts/ 100 heart beats to 72 ± 5 bursts/ 100 heart beats; p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 003, respectively), systolic BP (from 135 ± 5 mm Hg to 120 ± 6 mm Hg, p = 0. 03), and HR (from 69 ± 2 min− 1 to 66 ± 2 min− 1; p = 0. 013). ConclusionsTreatment of coexisting OSA by CPAP in HF patients lowers daytime MSNA, systolic BP, and HR. Inhibition of increased central sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow is one mechanism by which nocturnal CPAP reduces awake BP in HF patients with moderate to severe OSA...|$|R

Methods SMOOTH was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, multicentre trial. After a 2 - to 4 -week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients received once-daily telmisartan 80 mg or valsartan 160 mg for 4 weeks, with add-on HCTZ 12. 5 mg for 6 weeks (T/HCTZ or V/HCTZ, respectively). At baseline and week 10, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured every 20 min and hourly means were calculated. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean ambulatory systolic and {{diastolic blood pressure}} (SBP; DBP) during the last 6 hours of the 24 -hour dosing interval.

To assess an {{efficacy}} of antihypertensive therapy with calcium antagonist, {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitor and â-blocker in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) taking into account influence on central and peripheral hemodynamics. Material and methods. 60 patients with AH of I-II stage, 1 - 2 grade were studied. They were split in 3 groups. Patients of the first group received amlodipine (Tenox), 5 - 10 mg/d, the second group – fosinopril (Monopril), 10 - 20 mg/d and the third group – metoprolol (Metocard), 50 - 200 mg/d. Diuretics were added when necessary. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, echocardiography, ultrasound investigation of brachiocephalic and main cerebral arteries, test on reactive hyperemia and nitroglycerine were conducted before and after 6 months of therapy. Results. Amlodipine, fosinopril and metoprolol had similar antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine was more effective in comparison with fosinopril and metoprolol in reduction of left ventricular (LV) myocardial mass and improving of LV diastolic function. Amlodipine and fosinopril had positive effect on vascular remodeling. Metoprolol reduced in <b>BP</b> <b>morning</b> elevation and heart rate, but {{had no effect on}} systolic BP variability.

40|$|Background Based on meta-analyses, {{the blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) lowering effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) {{is reported to be}} approximately 2 - 3 mmHg. This figure is derived from heterogeneous trials, often limited by poor CPAP-adherence, and thus possibly underestimating the treatment effect. We analyzed <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> data from three randomized controlled CPAP withdrawal trials which included only patients with optimal CPAP-compliance. Methods Within the three trials, 149 OSA patients on CPAP were randomized to continue therapeutic CPAP (n= 65) or to withdraw CPAP (n= 84) for two weeks. <b>Morning</b> <b>BP</b> was measured at home before, and after sleep studies in hospital. Results CPAP-withdrawal was associated with a return of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) at baseline 2. 8 /h, at follow-up 33. 2 /h). Systolic office BP increased in the CPAP-withdrawal group, compared to CPAP-continuation, by + 5. 4 mmHg (95 %CI 1. 8 - 8. 9 mmHg, p= 0. 003), and systolic home BP by + 9. 0 mmHg (95 %-CI 5. 7 - 12. 3 mmHg, p AHI, baseline home systolic BP, statin usage, gender, and number of antihypertensive drugs were all independently associated with systolic BP change in multivariate analysis, controlling for age, BMI, smoking, diabetes, and sleepiness. </p Conclusions CPAP-withdrawal results in a clinically relevant increase in BP, which is considerably higher than in conventional CPAP trials, and is also underestimated when office BP is used.

The ability to monitor BP throughout the day and night allows the detection of abnormal nocturnal BP patterns, the most common being a "nondipping" pattern, which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; its correction appears to {{have a positive impact on}} cardiovascular outcome. Antihypertensive treatment should be individually adjusted to control BP during both daytime and nighttime. However, drug-induced lowering of nocturnal BP, if excessive, could amplify the <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> surge in patients with daytime BP elevation, increasing the risk of developing a cardiovascular event.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study and investigate the efficiency of Thiotriazolin combined with antihypertensive drugs in connection with background therapy (BT) on the daily dynamics of blood pressure (BP) {{in comparison with the}} use of antihypertensive drugs only in connection with BT. Results of the research: Positive dynamics in the reduction of the frequency of the disease subjective clinical signs manifestations in two research groups was observed (р< 0. 05). Significant decrease in pain syndrome and dyspnea was detected in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and concomitant arterial hypertension (AH). The use of BT with ramipril and thiotriazolin ensured a gradual {{increase in the number of}} patients with the most favorable profile “diрper”. The inclusion of ramipril to BT or its combination with thiotriazolin resulted in a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability. Dynamics of systolic blood pressure (SBP) morning rise rate was analyzed. Morning rise rate (MRR) of systolic blood pressure significantly decreased in 3 months of investigation in patients treated with BT and ramipril or its combination with thiotriazolin.

Our aim was to evaluate determinants of home-based morning-evening difference (MEdiff) in Argentine patients. Methods. Treated hypertensive patients aged ≥ 18 years participated in a cross-sectional study, after performing home <b>morning</b> and evening <b>BP</b> measurement. MEdiff was morning minus evening home average results. Variables identified as relevant predictors were entered into a multivariable linear regression analysis model. Results. Three hundred sixty-seven medicated hypertensives were included. Mean age was 66. 2 (14. 5), BMI 28. 1 (4. 5), total cholesterol 4. 89 (1. 0) [*]mmol/L, 65. 9 % women, 11. 7 % smokers, and 10. 6 % diabetics. Mean MEdiff was 1. 1 (12. 5) [*]mmHg systolic and 2. 3 (6. 1) [*]mmHg diastolic, respectively. Mean self-recorded BP was 131. 5 (14. 1) [*]mmHg systolic and 73. 8 (7. 6) [*]mmHg diastolic, respectively.

40|$|Cardiovascular events (CE) occur most {{frequently}} in the morning hours in hypertensive subjects. We studied the association between the <b>morning</b> blood pressure (<b>BP)</b> surge and CE in prognosis of 10 normotensive and 32 well-controlled hypertensive elderly, in whom ambulatory BP monitoring was performed and who were followed prospectively for 5 years. The morning surge (MS) of BP was calculated as mean systolic BP during 2 h after awakening - mean systolic BP during 1 h that included the lowest sleep BP. During an average of 60 months, five CE occurred. When the patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to MS, those in the top terzile (MS group; MS ≥ 34 mmHg, n = 14) had a higher prevalence of CE (5 versus 0, p = 0. 001) during the follow-up period, than the others (non-MS group; MS < 34 mmHg, n = 28). The logistic regression analysis showed the MS sleep-trough surge as predictive variable of CE (odds ratio, OR = 0. 794, p = 0. 022). In conclusion, in older normotensives and well-controlled hypertensives, a higher BP MS is associated with vascular risk independently of clinical and ambulatory BP. Reduction of the MS could thus be a therapeutic target for preventing vascular events also in non-hypertensive patients. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nocturnal urinary sodium {{excretion}} {{is related}} to blood pressure (BP) levels. Elevated BP and increased nocturnal natriuresis have been demonstrated in adults with sleep apnea. Although evidence indicates increased BP in children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), it is unknown whether these children have also enhanced urinary sodium excretion. Objective: To evaluate the effects of SDB and <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> on urinary sodium excretion. Methods: Consecutive children with snoring (n = 95) underwent polysomnography and <b>morning</b> <b>BP</b> measurement. Fractional excretion of sodium (FE(Na)) was the primary outcome measure and was calculated using sodium and creatinine concentrations in early morning serum and urine specimens. Results: Subjects with moderate-to-severe SDB had similar log-transformed FE(Na) to that of children with mild SDB and higher than children with primary snoring: - 0. 13 +/- 0. 53 versus - 0. 28 +/- 0. 41 versus - 0. 61 +/- 0. 65 (P = 0. 657 and P = 0. 003). Obstructive apnea-hypopnea index {{was significantly related to}} FE(Na) after adjustment for age, gender and body mass index z-score (P = 0. 002). Children with moderate-to-severe SDB had similar systolic BP z-scores to those of subjects with mild SDB and higher than participants with primary snoring: 0. 7 +/- 1. 2 versus 0. 1 +/- 1. 0 versus - 0. 02 +/- 1. 0 (P = 0. 074 and P = 0. 046). In addition, participants with diastolic BP z-scores in the upper quartile of measured values had higher FE(Na) than subjects with z-scores in the lower quartiles: - 0. 08 +/- 0. 39 versus - 0. 41 +/- 0. 57 (P = 0. 007).

40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is best predicted by asleep {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP), and lowering it by scheduling ≥ 1 conventional long-acting hypertension medications, alone or in combination, at bedtime significantly lessens vascular-associated risks. Some 20 years ago, four controlled-onset extended-release drug-delivery systems incorporating a calcium channel or β-blocker, with the treatment goal specifically being attenuation of morning rather than asleep BP, were conceived as one type of bedtime hypertension chronotherapy. However, the CONVINCE outcomes trial failed to substantiate the merit of targeting <b>morning</b> and daytime <b>BP</b> to decrease CVD risk. The HOPE trial, entailing bedtime ramipril treatment for high CVD risk patients, showed substantial reduction of vascular-related events, theorized as the beneficial treatment-time-dependent strong asleep BP lowering. The MAPEC trial was the first prospective randomized treatment-time outcomes investigation to test the worthiness of bedtime hypertension chronotherapy entailing ≥ 1 conventional long-acting medications (BTCT), {{in comparison to the}} conventional morning-time therapeutic scheme for all medications (CMTT), to normalize asleep BP and diminish CVD risk. BTCT compared to CMTT significantly better lowered asleep BP and most importantly major CVD-associated morbidity and mortality, including myocardial infarction and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, by ~ 60 %. CVD risk reduction was strongest when the BTCT included an angiotensin receptor blocker. The HOPE and MAPEC trials provide positive evidence of very significant CVD risk reduction by a BTCT strategy that specifically targets normalization of asleep BP, evidence that awaits confirmation by the ongoing Hygia and other outcomes trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLight-dependent {{transcriptional}} {{regulation of}} clock genes {{is a crucial}} step in the entrainment of the circadian clock [1]. E 4 bp 4 is a light-inducible gene in the chick pineal gland [2], and it encodes a bZIP protein that represses transcription of cPer 2, a chick pineal clock gene [2, 3]. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged light period-dependent accumulation of E 4 BP 4 protein is temporally coordinated with a delay of the rising phase of cPer 2 in the <b>morning.</b> E 4 <b>BP</b> 4 was phosphorylated progressively and then disappeared in parallel with induced cPer 2 expression. Characterization of E 4 BP 4 revealed Ser 182, a phosphoacceptor site located at the amino-terminal border of the Ser/Thr cluster, which forms the phosphorylation motifs for casein kinase 1 ϵ (CK 1 ϵ). CK 1 ϵ physically associated with E 4 BP 4 and phosphorylated it. CK 1 ϵ-catalyzed phosphorylation of E 4 BP 4 resulted in proteasomal proteolysis-dependent decrease of E 4 BP 4 levels, while E 4 BP 4 nuclear accumulation was attenuated by CK 1 ϵ in a kinase activity-independent manner. CK 1 ϵ-mediated posttranslational regulation was accompanied by reduction of the transcriptional repression executed by E 4 BP 4. These results not only demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism for E 4 BP 4 function but also highlight the role of CK 1 ϵ as a negative regulator for E 4 BP 4 -mediated repression of cPer 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of many biologic phenomena displays a reproducible and cyclic variation. Cardiovascular disease, {{the most common}} cause of death in the United States and other developed countries, also has an intrinsic variation in events. These events are more common in winter, at the beginning of each month, on Mondays (in working peo-ple), and during the early morning hours of each day. Recent meta-analyses have quantitated the excess risk of cardiovascular events in the hours around and just after awakening. Between 6 AM and noon, there is a 40 % higher risk of heart attack, a 29 % increased risk of cardiac death, and a 49 % increased risk of stroke (com-pared with what would be expected if these events happened at random and were evenly distributed through-out the day). These observations have major consequences for emergency medical personnel and medical transport systems. The reasons for these observations are less clear. The circadian pattern of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate may be a major contributor, and long-term “hard end-point ” studies designed to test specific pharmacologic interventions targeting the early <b>morning</b> rise in <b>BP</b> and heart rate are underway.
