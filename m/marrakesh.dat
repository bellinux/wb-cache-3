5|$|<b>Marrakesh</b> {{is served}} by Ménara International Airport and the <b>Marrakesh</b> railway station, which connects the city to Casablanca and {{northern}} Morocco. <b>Marrakesh</b> has several universities and schools, including Cadi Ayyad University. A number of Moroccan football clubs are located here, including Najm de Marrakech, KAC Marrakech, Mouloudia de Marrakech and Chez Ali Club de Marrakech. The <b>Marrakesh</b> Street Circuit hosts the World Touring Car Championship, Auto GP and FIA Formula Two Championship races.|$|E
5|$|Like many Moroccan cities, <b>Marrakesh</b> {{comprises}} an old fortified city {{packed with}} vendors and their stalls (the medina), bordered by modern neighbourhoods, {{the most prominent}} of which is Gueliz. Today {{it is one of the}} busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic centre and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, Mohammed VI, with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in <b>Marrakesh</b> has grown dramatically in the 21st century. <b>Marrakesh</b> is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. <b>Marrakesh</b> has the largest traditional market (souk) in Morocco, with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists. <b>Marrakesh</b> is one of North Africa’s largest centres of wildlife trade, despite the illegality of much of this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Tortoises are particularly popular for sale as pets but Barbary macaques and snakes can also be seen.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 <b>Marrakesh</b> ePrix (formally the 2016 FIA Formula E <b>Marrakesh</b> ePrix) was a Formula E motor race held on 12 November 2016 at the Circuit Moulay El Hassan in <b>Marrakesh,</b> Morocco {{in front}} of a crowd of 7,000 people. It was {{the second round of the}} 2016–17 Formula E season and the first time the series had visited the African continent. The 33-lap race was won by e.Dams-Renault driver Sébastien Buemi, who started from the seventh position. Sam Bird {{finished}} second for the Virgin team and Mahindra driver Felix Rosenqvist came in third.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Yusuf II in 1224 began {{a period of}} instability. <b>Marrakesh</b> became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and the ahl ad-dar (descendants of Ibn Tumart), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. <b>Marrakesh</b> was taken, lost and retaken by force {{multiple}} times by a stream of caliphs and pretenders, such as during the brutal seizure of <b>Marrakesh</b> by the Sevillan caliph Abd al-Wahid II al-Ma'mun in 1226, which {{was followed by a}} massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation of Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah mosque. After al-Ma'mun's death in 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquiring the support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand <b>Marrakesh</b> over to them for the sack. Hearing of the terms, the people of <b>Marrakesh</b> sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city from destruction with a sizable payoff of 500,000 dinars. In 1269, <b>Marrakesh</b> was conquered by nomadic Zenata tribes who overran the last of the Almohads. The city then fell into a state of decline, which soon led to the loss of its status as capital to rival city Fes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with <b>Marrakesh.</b> Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in <b>Marrakesh</b> and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several <b>Marrakesh</b> female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2014 census, the {{population}} of <b>Marrakesh</b> was 928,850 against 843,575 in 2004. The number of households in 2014 was 217,245 against 173,603 in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of decline, the city was surpassed by Fes, {{but in the early}} 16th century, <b>Marrakesh</b> again became the capital of the kingdom. The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al-Qaim and Ahmad al-Mansur, who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace (1578) and {{restored}} many ruined monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among Sufi pilgrims for Morocco's seven patron saints, who are entombed here. In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and T'hami El Glaoui became Pasha of <b>Marrakesh</b> and held this position nearly throughout the duration of the protectorate until the role was dissolved upon independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956. In 2009, <b>Marrakesh</b> mayor Fatima Zahra Mansouri became the second woman to be elected mayor in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, <b>Marrakesh</b> {{underwent}} {{several years of}} unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier Ba Ahmed, who had been designated regent until the designated sultan Abd al-Aziz became of age, the country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, <b>Marrakesh</b> caliph Moulay Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by Ulama scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother, Abd al-Aziz. It was also in 1907 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, was murdered in <b>Marrakesh,</b> suspected of spying for his country. France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of Oujda to the major metropolitan centre of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al-Hiba, a son of Sheikh Ma al-'Aynayn, who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Reguibat tribal warriors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established. After the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman, which saw {{the victory of the}} French Mangin column over the al-Hiba forces in September 1912, the French seized <b>Marrakesh.</b> The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their leaders from the powerful Glaoui family, leading to a massacre of <b>Marrakesh</b> citizens in the resulting turmoil.|$|E
5|$|Shrimp, {{chicken and}} lemon-filled briouats are another {{traditional}} specialty of <b>Marrakesh.</b> Rice is cooked with saffron, raisins, spices, and almonds, while couscous may have added vegetables. A pastilla is a filo-wrapped pie stuffed with minced chicken or pigeon {{that has been}} prepared with almonds, cinnamon, spices and sugar. Harira soup in <b>Marrakesh</b> typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and tripe stew are commonly sold at the stalls of Jemaa el-Fnaa.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Marrakesh</b> {{area was}} {{inhabited}} by Berber farmers from Neolithic times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area. <b>Marrakesh</b> {{was founded in}} 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar) by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and second cousin of the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin (c. 1061–1106). Under the Almoravids, pious and learned warriors from the desert, numerous mosques and madrasas (Koranic schools) were built, developing the community into a trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Marrakesh</b> grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting Aghmat, which had long been the capital of Haouz. Andalusian craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville built and decorated numerous palaces in the city, developing the Umayyad style characterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique style of architecture which was fully adapted to the <b>Marrakesh</b> environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin completed the city's first mosque (the Ben Youssef mosque, named after his son), built houses, minted coins, and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans. The city became {{the capital of the}} Almoravid Emirate, stretching from the shores of Senegal to the centre of Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers.|$|E
5|$|The desserts of <b>Marrakesh</b> include chebakia (sesame spice cookies usually {{prepared}} and served during Ramadan), tartlets of filo dough with dried fruit, or cheesecake with dates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marrakesh</b> {{is one of}} {{the great}} citadels of the Muslim world. The city was {{fortified}} by Tashfin's son, Ali ibn Yusuf, who in 1122–1123 built the ramparts which remain to this day, completed further mosques and palaces, and developed an underground water system in the city known as the rhettara to irrigate his new garden. In 1125, the preacher Ibn Tumert settled in Tin Mal in the mountains to the south of <b>Marrakesh.</b> He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby Aghmat, but stopped short of bringing down <b>Marrakesh</b> following an unsuccessful siege in 1130. The Almohads, Masmouda tribesmen from the High Atlas mountains who practiced orthodox Islam, took the city in 1147 under leader Abd al-Mu'min. After a long siege and the killing of some 7,000 people, the last of the Almoravids were exterminated apart from those who sought exile in the Balearic Islands. As a result, almost all the city's monuments were destroyed. The Almohads constructed a range of palaces and religious buildings, including the famous Koutoubia Mosque (1184–1199), and built upon the ruins of an Almoravid palace. It was a twin of the Giralda in Seville and the unfinished Hassan Tower in Rabat, all built by the same designer. The Kasbah housed the residence of the caliph, a title borne by the Almohad rulers from the reign of Abd al-Mu'min, rivaling the far eastern Abbasid Caliphate. The Kasbah was named after the caliph Yaqub al-Mansur. The irrigation system was perfected to provide water for new palm groves and parks, including the Menara Garden. As a result of its cultural reputation, <b>Marrakesh</b> attracted many writers and artists, especially from Andalusia, including the famous philosopher Averroes of Cordoba.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marrakesh,</b> the {{regional}} capital, constitutes a prefecture-level administrative unit of Morocco, Marrakech Prefecture, forming {{part of the}} region of Marrakech-Safi. <b>Marrakesh</b> is a major centre for law and jurisdiction in Morocco {{and most of the}} major courts of the region are located here. These include {{the regional}} Court of Appeal, the Commercial Court, the Administrative Court, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal of Commerce, and the Administrative Court of Appeal. Numerous organizations of the region are based here, including the regional government administrative offices, the Regional Council of Tourism office, and regional public maintenance organisations such as the Governed Autonomous Water Supply and Electricity and Maroc Telecom.|$|E
5|$|Metalwork made in <b>Marrakesh</b> {{includes}} brass lamps, iron lanterns, candle holders {{made from}} recycled sardine tins, and engraved brass teapots and tea trays used in the traditional serving of tea. Contemporary art includes sculpture and figurative paintings. Blue veiled Tuareg figurines and calligraphy paintings are also popular.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Marrakesh</b> {{railway station}} is linked by several trains running daily to other major cities in Morocco such as Casablanca, Tangiers, Fez, Meknes and Rabat. A modern {{high-speed}} rail {{system has been}} planned.|$|E
5|$|Festivals, both {{national}} and Islamic, are celebrated in <b>Marrakesh</b> {{and throughout the}} country, {{and some of them}} are observed as national holidays. Cultural festivals of note held in <b>Marrakesh</b> include the National Folklore Festival, the Marrakech Festival of Popular Arts (in which a variety of famous Moroccan musicians and artists participate), and the Berber Festival. The International Film Festival of Marrakech, which aspires to be the North African version of the Cannes Film Festival, was established in 2001. The festival, which showcases over 100 films from around the world annually, has attracted Hollywood stars such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Susan Sarandon, Jeremy Irons, Roman Polanski and many European, Arabic and Indian film stars. The Marrakech Bienniale was established in 2004 by Vanessa Branson as a cultural festival in various disciplines, including visual arts, cinema, video, literature, performing arts, and architecture.|$|E
5|$|Football clubs {{based in}} <b>Marrakesh</b> include Najm de Marrakech, KAC Marrakech, Mouloudia de Marrakech and Chez Ali Club de Marrakech. The city {{contains}} the Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan a race track which hosts the World Touring Car Championship and from 2017 FIA Formula E. The Marrakech Marathon is also held here. Roughly 5000 runners turn {{out for the}} event annually.|$|E
5|$|The Ben Youssef Madrasa, located to {{the north}} of the Medina, was an Islamic college in <b>Marrakesh</b> named after the Almoravid sultan Ali ibn Yusuf (1106–1142) who {{expanded}} the city and its influence considerably. It is the largest madrasa in all of Morocco and was one of the largest theological colleges in North Africa, at one time housing as many as 900 students.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marrakesh</b> {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 2012, it was {{announced}} that Kenya was chosen to host the tournament after bids were placed by the host nation as well as Rwanda. However, their hosting of the tournament was not confirmed until a congress meeting for the Confederation of African Football held in <b>Marrakesh,</b> Morocco on 11 March 2013, after it {{was announced}} that the Football Kenya Federation had met all the requirements for hosting the tournaments with support from the Kenyan government. The capital city Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Machakos and Nakuru were identified as host cities for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Tensions began rising between Lhermitte and her husband. Moqadem {{would spend}} long {{hours away from}} home, {{becoming}} a regular at a bar and a spa. In addition, he would take several trips each year to visit his family in <b>Marrakesh,</b> with the length of each trip ranging from a week to a month. Lhermitte's first son and fifth child, Mehdi, was born on August 9, 2003. The following year, Schaar recommended that Lhermitte should see a psychiatrist and she began consulting the psychiatrist Dr. Diderick Veldekens in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Arts in Marrakech International Festival, {{a festival}} of English and Arabic art and literature, {{was held in}} Morocco from 29 September to 3 October 2005, and was preceded by Scottish Week <b>Marrakesh,</b> 21–28 September, also {{organised}} by Ganguli. The festival included two art exhibitions, one of Moroccan art and one of contemporary British art, {{under the aegis of}} Vanessa Branson, sister of tycoon Richard Branson; interviews; readings; and panel discussions on Anglo-Arabic literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{arts and}} crafts of <b>Marrakesh</b> have had a wide and {{enduring}} impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). Ceramics are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E
5|$|With 130,000 {{hectares}} of greenery and over 180,000 palm trees in its Palmeraie, <b>Marrakesh</b> is {{an oasis of}} rich plant variety. Throughout the seasons, fragrant orange, fig, pomegranate and olive trees display their color and fruits in Agdal Garden, Menara Garden and other gardens in the city. The city's gardens feature numerous native plants alongside other species that have been imported {{over the course of}} the centuries, including giant bamboos, yuccas, papyrus, palm trees, banana trees, cypress, philodendrons, rose bushes, bougainvilleas, pines and various kinds of cactus plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Brown {{served as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976. In 1972, Brown travelled again, this time to African cities which include Gao, Cairo, Segou, <b>Marrakesh,</b> Timbuktu, Fez, Ibandan, Benin, Axum, Kumasi and Luxor.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Palace, {{also known}} as Dar el-Makhzen, is located next to the Badi Palace. The Almohads built the palace in the 12th century {{on the site of}} their kasba, and it was partly remodeled by the Saadians in the 16th century and the Alaouites in the 17th century. Historically {{it was one of the}} palaces owned by the Moroccan king, who {{employed}} some of the most talented craftsmen in the city for its construction. The palace is not open to the public, and is now privately owned by French businessman Dominique du Beldi. The rooms are large, with unusually high ceilings for <b>Marrakesh,</b> with zellij (elaborate geometric terracotta tile work covered with enamel) and cedar painted ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} {{wealth of}} the city is manifested in palaces, mansions and other lavish residences. The main palaces are El Badi Palace, the Royal Palace and Bahia Palace. Riads (Moroccan mansions) are common in <b>Marrakesh.</b> Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and lowered the temperature within the building. Buildings of note inside the Medina are Riad Argana, Riad Obry, Riad Enija, Riad el Mezouar, Riad Frans Ankone, Dar Moussaine, Riad Lotus, Riad Elixir, Riad les Bougainvilliers, Riad Dar Foundouk, Dar Marzotto, Dar Darma, and Riad Pinco Pallino. Others of note outside the Medina area include Ksar Char Bagh, Amanjena, Villa Maha, Dar Ahlam, Dar Alhind and Dar Tayda.|$|E
25|$|Al-Abbas {{was born}} in Ceuta, but moved to <b>Marrakesh</b> in 1145-6, during the final weeks of the Almohad siege of the city. For {{a number of years}} he lived in a cave on the hill of Igilliz outside <b>Marrakesh,</b> only coming into town on Fridays for the {{communal}} prayer.|$|E
25|$|Jewish communities, in Islamic times often {{living in}} ghettos known as mellah, have existed in Morocco {{for at least}} 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of 6,000 Jews in Fez in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and <b>Marrakesh</b> in 1146 and again in <b>Marrakesh</b> in 1232) were {{accompanied}} by systematic discrimination through the years.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, <b>Marrakesh</b> has {{maintained}} a keen rivalry with Fez as the leading city in Morocco, and the country often fragmented politically into two halves, with Fez {{the capital of the}} north and <b>Marrakesh</b> the capital of the south. The choice of Rabat as the capital of modern Morocco {{can be seen as a}} compromise that afforded neither of the two rival cities primacy over the other.|$|E
25|$|Page's {{passion for}} diverse musical {{experiences}} influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically <b>Marrakesh</b> in Morocco where he encountered Umm Kulthum.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>Marrakesh,</b> {{a city in}} {{southern}} Morocco, stretches back nearly a thousand years. The country of Morocco itself is named after it.|$|E
25|$|Task: Purchase a {{set list}} of items in the marketplaces of <b>Marrakesh,</b> Morocco, {{negotiating}} for low prices. Least amount spent, after addition of fines, wins.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the biggest}} {{negotiating}} mandate on trade ever agreed: the talks were going to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review. The Final Act concluding the Uruguay Round and officially establishing the WTO regime was signed 15 April 1994, during the ministerial meeting at <b>Marrakesh,</b> Morocco, and hence {{is known as the}} <b>Marrakesh</b> Agreement.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} was formalized in the Kyoto Protocol, {{an international}} agreement between more than 170 countries, {{and the market}} mechanisms were agreed through the subsequent <b>Marrakesh</b> Accords.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} <b>Marrakesh,</b> the plain {{south of the}} Tensift River in {{southern}} Morocco, was inhabited by Berber farmers since Neolithic times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area.|$|E
