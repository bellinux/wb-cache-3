The heat <b>map</b> <b>measure</b> is based on traditional gaze heat maps and sums up the users ’ fixation durations per pixel. Both mea-sures are applied on gaze data obtained for a set of social media images, which have manually labeled objects as ground truth. We have deter-mined a maximum average precision of 65 % at which the segmentation measure points to the correct region in the image. The best coverage of the segments is obtained for the segmentation measure with a F-measure of 35 %. Overall, both newly introduced gaze-based measures deliver bet-ter results than baseline measures that selects a segment based on the golden ratio of photography or the center position in the image.

40|$|Session: Multimedia Content UnderstandingInternational audienceContext {{helps to}} {{understand}} the meaning of a word and allows the disambiguation of polysemic terms. Many researches took advantage of this notion in information retrieval. For concept-based video indexing and retrieval, this idea seems a priori valid. One of the major problems is then to provide a definition of the context and to choose the most appropriate methods for using it. Two kinds of contexts were exploited in the past to improve concepts detection: in some works, inter-concepts relations are used as semantic context, where other approaches use the temporal features of videos to improve concepts detection. Results of these works showed that the "temporal" and the "semantic" contexts can improve concept detection. In this work we use the semantic context through an ontology and exploit the efficiency of the temporal context in a "two-layers" re-ranking approach. Experiments conducted on TRECVID 2010 data show that the proposed approach always improves over initial results obtained using either MSVM or KNN classifiers or their late fusion, achieving relative gains between 9 % and 33 % of the <b>MAP</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The shared {{medium of}} 802. 11 {{wireless}} networks {{means that they}} are susceptible to many MAC-layer attacks, such as frame spoofing, denial of service, and greedy misbehavior. To detect such attacks {{it is necessary to}} monitor the wireless channel itself and examine the timing and content of the 802. 11 frames. Wireless “sniffing ” is challenging: sniffers may not hear every frame, nearby sniffers may hear identical frames, sniffers ’ clocks may be poorly synchronized, or a sniffer may have its radio listening to a different channel than that on which an attack is occurring. In addition, sniffing a large-scale wireless network at a reasonable cost is also a challenge. We present <b>MAP</b> (<b>Measure,</b> Analyze, Protect), a scalable architecture for extensive wireless measurement. MAP features dedicated sniffers, near-realtime multi-sniffer traffic merging, coordinated channel sampling, full stream capturing with feature extraction, and analysis-driven capture “refocusing. ” Using a deployment of 20 sniffers placed over a three-floor building, we demonstrate how these features help to improve detection accuracy in realistic attack scenarios. Performance evaluation shows that MAP is both effective and efficient at scale. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Image {{retrieval}} in large-scale databases {{is currently}} {{based on a}} textual chains matching procedure, a technique that produces good results {{as long as the}} annotations associated to pictures are accurate and detailed enough. These conditions are not met for a large majority of image corpuses, such as the Wikipedia collection, and it is interesting to explore methods that go beyond chain matching. In this paper, we present our approach to image retrieval, tested in the ImageCLEF 2008 WikipediaMM. The approach is based on a query reformulation using concepts that are semantically related to those in the initial query. For each interesting entity in the query, we used Wikipedia and WordNet to extract and list of related concepts, which were further ranked in order to propose the most salient in priority. We also made a list of visual concepts which were used in order to re-rank the answers to queries that included, implicitly or explicitly, these visual concepts. The CEA submitted two automatic runs, one based on query reformulation only and one combining query reformulation and visual concepts, which were ranked 4 th and 2 nd using the <b>MAP</b> <b>measure.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Person re-identification aims at {{establishing}} {{the identity of}} a pedestrian from a gallery that contains images of multiple people obtained from a multi-camera system. Many challenges such as occlusions, drastic lighting and pose variations across the camera views, indiscriminate visual appearances, cluttered backgrounds, imperfect detections, motion blur, and noise make this task highly challenging. While most approaches focus on learning features and metrics to derive better representations, we hypothesize that both local and global contextual cues are crucial for an accurate identity matching. To this end, we propose a Feature Mask Network (FMN) that takes advantage of ResNet high-level features to predict a feature map mask and then imposes it on the low-level features to dynamically reweight different object parts for a locally aware feature representation. This serves as an effective attention mechanism by allowing the network to focus on local details selectively. Given the resemblance of person re-identification with classification and retrieval tasks, we frame the network training as a multi-task objective optimization, which further improves the learned feature descriptions. We conduct experiments on Market- 1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK 03 datasets, where the proposed approach respectively achieves significant improvements of 5. 3 %, 9. 1 % and 10. 7 % in <b>mAP</b> <b>measure</b> relative to the state-of-the-art.
