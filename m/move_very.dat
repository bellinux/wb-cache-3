5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches <b>move</b> <b>very</b> quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Further north, the {{hurricane}} threatened to strike or <b>move</b> <b>very</b> {{close to the}} Outer Banks. Hurricane warnings were posted from Cape Hatteras to Manteo, and ships were advised to remain at port. Hurricane How produced 50mph (80km/h) winds and high tides along the Outer Banks and southeastern Virginia. Some minor damage was reported, and two ships were washed ashore. In New England, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Portland, Maine, with rains, fog, and heavy surf reported. Several roads were closed in Massachusetts due to the tides.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects <b>move</b> <b>very</b> slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can <b>move</b> <b>very</b> freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to <b>move</b> <b>very</b> late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} steadily strengthened as {{it moved}} towards the northwest around the western periphery of the Azores High on September 25. Encountering the anticyclone situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, Helene began to curve slightly towards the west. The lack of strong steering currents in the storm's vicinity caused the hurricane to <b>move</b> <b>very</b> slowly throughout the day, giving the hurricane time to significantly intensify. By 0000 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with a minimum pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Moving slowly towards The Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified. A recon flight reported a minimum pressure of 948 mbar (hPa; 28.00 inHg), a drop of 40 mbar (hPa; 1.18 inHg) from the previous day. As the hurricane neared the coast, its eye became apparent on coastal long-range WSR-57 weather radar images. By 1800 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane and then to a Category 4 hurricane the following day. The major hurricane continued to strengthen before reaching its peak intensity on September 27 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). However, Helene's lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg) was recorded earlier during the day. Still moving northwestward due to the influence of the Azores High, the hurricane came within 10 mi (15 km) of the US East Coast before recurving towards the northeast out to sea.|$|E

25|$|Hedgehog has {{roles in}} larval body segment {{development}} and in formation of adult appendages. During {{the formation of}} body segments in the developing Drosophila embryo, stripes of cells that synthesize the transcription factor engrailed can also express the cell-to-cell signaling protein Hedgehog (green in Figure 4). Hedgehog is not free to <b>move</b> <b>very</b> far from the cells that make it and so it only activates a thin stripe of cells adjacent to the engrailed-expressing cells. When acting in this local fashion, hedgehog works as a paracrine factor. Only cells {{to one side of}} the engrailed-expressing cells are competent to respond to Hedgehog following interaction of Hh with the receptor protein Patched (blue in Figure 4).|$|E

25|$|Weather {{and poor}} {{communication}} with his divisional commanders had robbed Jackson {{of the initiative}} in the fight. Still expecting to face the same cautious opponent from the Valley, he was taken by surprise and very nearly driven from the field. Excellent commanding by the Confederates at the crucial moment of the battle and the fortuitous arrival of Hill staved off defeat, eventually allowing their numerical superiority to drive the Federals from the field. For his part, Banks, having been soundly defeated by Jackson in the Valley, was anxious {{to make up for}} previous losses. Rather than fighting a defensive battle from a strong position because he was outnumbered 2 to 1, giving time for the rest of Pope's army to arrive, he decided to take the initiative and attack Jackson before he could fully form his lines. The bold <b>move</b> <b>very</b> nearly paid off, but in the end he was again defeated by his old foe.|$|E
25|$|Back home, Steve becomes {{outraged at}} Roger and start fighting, until he finds Roger washing a stress ball he used for another persona. When Steve {{questions}} him on {{why he is}} cleaning it, Roger reveals he is using {{it in order to}} have sex with Snot. At the Wild West Land amusement park, Steve spills the news to Snot, showing the stress ball as proof. Devastated, Snot ends his relationship with Roger, which upsets Roger as well. Steve brings back up his original 31 flavors idea, but Snot still remains depressed from his broken relationship. Steve devises another idea to get him and Roger back together. In his Jenny disguise, Roger meets Snot again and apologizes for his past actions, and Snot accepts him back into their relationship again, at least until Roger gets hit and killed by a bus, much to Snot's depression once again until Steve tells Snot he has gotten closer to having sex with someone than anyone in the group has ever been. Roger shows up again at the scene in another disguise and tells Steve that he faked his death, explaining his ability to <b>move</b> <b>very</b> fast as he sets up a decoy of his Jenny persona right before the bus hits it.|$|E

500|$|At 1330UTC on December16, the Mauritius Meteorological Services {{designated}} {{the system as}} a moderate tropical storm, thus assigning it the name Amara. At the time the storm had a minimum barometric pressure estimated at 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg). During the subsequent hours, the storm began to slowly track west-southwest under the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge. Amara's circulation center consolidated and rainbands became more tightly wrapped around the center, at which time the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the system. Late on December17, Amara began to develop an eye, observable via microwave imagery. Based on the antecedent developments, MÃ©tÃ©o-France upgraded the system to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC the following day. Nine hours later, the JTWC upgraded Amara to tropical cyclone intensity, with MÃ©tÃ©o-France following suit three hours later. Situated in a location with low vertical wind shear and outspread outflow, Amara was forecast to continue strengthening, though {{at the same time the}} cyclone was expected to <b>move</b> <b>very</b> slowly due to its interaction with weak steering currents in between two subtropical ridges. Rapid intensification ensued throughout the latter hours of December18, coinciding with the development of a ragged eye feature within the tropical cyclone on infrared imagery. MÃ©tÃ©o-France upgraded Amara to intense tropical cyclone status at 0000UTC on December19. By this time the storm's central pressure had fallen to 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly after, however, Amara's once well-defined outflow pattern became suppressed, resulting in a slight weakening and a downgrade from intense tropical cyclone status just twelve hours later.|$|E
