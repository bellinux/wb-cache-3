NmeBI, {{which is}} a homologue of the R-M system HgaI of Pasteurella volantium, was present in <b>meningococci</b> of the ET- 5 complex and of lineage III. NmeAI was found in serogroup A, ET- 37 complex, and cluster A 4 <b>meningococci.</b> NmeDI was harbored by <b>meningococci</b> of the ET- 37 complex and of cluster A 4, but not by serogroup A <b>meningococci.</b> Two of the R-M systems, NmeBI and NmeDI, were located at homologous positions between the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase genes pheS and pheT, which {{appeared to be a}} preferential target for the insertion of foreign DNA in <b>meningococci.</b> The distribution of the three R-M systems was tested with 103 meningococcal strains comprising 49 sequence types. The vast majority of the strains had either NmeBI, NmeAI, or both NmeAI and NmeDI. Using cocultivation experiments, we could demonstrate that NmeBI, which was present in ET- 5 complex <b>meningococci,</b> was responsible for a partial restriction of DNA transfer from <b>meningococci</b> of the ET- 37 complex to <b>meningococci</b> of the ET- 5 complex...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{the present}} study suggest that natural {{immunity}} to meningococcal disease is initiated, reinforced, and broadened by intermittent carriage of different strains of <b>meningococci</b> throughout life. In young adults, carriage of <b>meningococci</b> in the nasopharynx is an efficient process of immune sensitization. 92 % of carriers of serogroup B, C, or Bo <b>meningococci</b> were found to develop increased titers of serum bactericidal activity to their own meningococcal isolate, and 87 % developed bactericidal activity to heterologous strains of pathogenic <b>meningococci.</b> The rise in bactericidal titer occurred within 2 wk of onset of the carrier state, and was accompanied by an increase in titer of specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to <b>meningococci.</b> In early childhood, when few children have antibodies to pathogenic <b>meningococci,</b> active immunization seems to occur as a result of carriage of atypical, nonpathogenic strains. Immunity to systemic meningococcal infection among infants in the neonatal period is associated with the passive transfer of IgG antibodies from mother to fetus.

2500|$|Neisseria meningitidis, often {{referred}} to as <b>meningococcus,</b> is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic [...] and endemic form.|$|E

40|$|Objective Invasive {{meningococcal}} disease (IMD) outbreaks in men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) have been associated with meningococcal colonisation of the urethra and rectum, but little is known about this colonisation or co-colonisation with the closely related gonococcus. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was employed to explore these phenomena. Methods <b>Meningococci</b> isolated from the urogenital tract and rectum (n= 23) and co-incident gonococci (n= 14) were analysed by WGS along with contemporary <b>meningococci</b> from IMD (n= 11). All isolates were obtained from hospital admissions in Brighton, UK, 2011 to 2013. Assembled WGS were deposited in the PubMLST/neisseria database ([URL] and compared at genomic loci common to gonococci or <b>meningococci.</b> Results As expected, most <b>meningococci</b> from IMD were encapsulated and belonged to hyperinvasive lineages. So too were <b>meningococci</b> found in the urogenital tract and rectum, contrasting to those asymptomatically carried in the nasopharynx where such <b>meningococci</b> are rare. Five hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages and four distinct gonococcal genotypes were recovered, including multiresistant ST- 1901 (NG MAST- 1407) gonococci. Conclusions These data were consistent with a predisposition for potentially virulent encapsulated hyperinvasive <b>meningococci</b> to colonise the urethra and rectum, which suggests their involvement in MSM IMD outbreaks.

40|$|Carrier {{strains of}} Neisseria meningitidis are {{recovered}} almost solely from the posterior pharynx {{and they are}} often nongroupable or rough. Invasive strains can be serogrouped (encapsulated). We studied adherence of both carrier- and patient-derived serogroupable and nongroupable <b>meningococci</b> to buccal epithelial and posterior pharyngeal cells. Fresh meningococcal isolates attached significantly better to pharyngeal than to buccal cells (P = 0. 01). Strains that could be serogrouped adhered less than nongroupable strains (P less than 0. 05). <b>Meningococci</b> passed in vitro became hemagglutinin negative and nonpiliated. Hemagglutinin-negative <b>meningococci</b> always adhered less to both epithelial cell types than the hemagglutinin-positive variants of the same strain.

40|$|Murine {{hybridoma}} monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) {{were produced}} against the capsular antigens of serogroups B, C, Y, and W 135 <b>meningococci.</b> Each serogroup-specific MAb reacted with the extracted capsular polysaccharide from its homologous serogroup only {{and did not}} react with capsules from the other three serogroups. The application of these MAbs for serogroup identification of <b>meningococci</b> was demonstrated by their abilities to correctly identify 183 clinical isolates of 185 <b>meningococci</b> recovered from individual invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) patients during routine surveillance in 2002. The remaining two <b>meningococci</b> were identified by PCR grouping as C in one case and Y in another, but neither isolate was positive by bacterial agglutination using rabbit antisera or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using MAbs. The specificities of the anti-Y and anti-W 135 MAbs were further assessed by tests with 37 serogroup W 135 and 106 serogroup Y <b>meningococci</b> recovered from IMD cases during 1999 to 2001 and 2003. All 143 <b>meningococci</b> except one serogroup Y isolate were correctly identified by positive reactions with the corresponding MAbs that identified their homologous serogroups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis is {{a diverse}} {{commensal}} bacterium that occasionally causes severe invasive disease. The relationship between meningococcal genotype and capsular polysaccharide, the principal virulence factor and vaccine component, {{was investigated in}} carried <b>meningococci</b> isolated from 8000 {{children and young adults}} in Bavaria, Germany. METHODS: Of the 830 <b>meningococci</b> isolated (carriage rate, 10. 4 %) by microbiological techniques, 822 were characterized by serogrouping, multilocus sequence typing, and genetic analysis of the capsule region. Statistical and population genetic analyses were applied to these data. RESULTS: The rapid increase in carriage rates with age of carrier, the low prevalence of hyperinvasive <b>meningococci,</b> and the relative prevalence of the 4 disease-associated serogroups were consistent with earlier observations. There was no genetic structuring of the meningococcal population by age of carrier or sampling location; however, there was significant geographic structuring of the <b>meningococci</b> isolated in civil, but not military, institutions. The rate of capsule gene expression did not vary with age of carrier or meningococcal genotype, except for serogroup C, for which increased expression was associated with ST- 11 (formerly ET- 37) complex <b>meningococci.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Serogroup C capsule expression during carriage may contribute to the invasive character of ST- 11 complex <b>meningococci</b> and to the high efficacy of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate polysaccharide vaccine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the relative contribution of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and non-LPS compo-nents of Neisseria meningitidis to {{the pathogenesis of}} meningococcal sepsis, this study quantitatively compared cytokine induction by isolated LPS, wild-type serogroup B <b>meningococci</b> (strain H 44 / 76), and LPS-deficient mutant <b>meningococci</b> (strain H 44 / 76 [pLAK 33]). Stimulation of human peripheral-blood mononuclear cells with wild-type and LPS-deficient <b>meningococci</b> showed that non-LPS com-ponents of <b>meningococci</b> are responsible for {{a substantial part of}} tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a and interleukin (IL) - 1 b production and virtually all interferon (IFN) -g production. Based on tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis analysis of LPS in proteinase K-treated lysates of N. meningitidis H 44 / 76, a quantitative comparison was made between the cytokine-induc-ing capacity of isolated and purified LPS and LPS-containing <b>meningococci.</b> At concentrations of> 107 bacteria/mL, intact bacteria were more po-tent cytokine inductors than equivalent amounts of isolated LPS, and cytokine induction by non-LPS components was additive to that by LPS.
