30|$|The {{preceding}} sections {{illustrate how}} 28 criticisms of Alexander’s second theory of architecture can be categorised hierarchically, formed into thematic groups, and their relationships mapped {{to reveal that}} many issues affecting {{the development and implementation}} of the theory can be connected to Alexander’s idiosyncratic ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions.</b> For instance, 12 criticisms [10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] (43 %) are directly connected to high level ontological problems [1, 2, 3] and a further 5 criticisms [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] (18 %) are directly connected to these secondary problems. Furthermore, 10 criticisms [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18] (36 %) are directly connected to Alexander’s epistemology [4] and a further 4 criticisms [23, 24, 25, 27] (14 %) are directly connected to these secondary criticisms. Surprisingly, only 2 criticisms [14, 28] (7 %) relate directly to the pattern language concept rather than criticisms of Alexander’s ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>and</b> these criticisms are amongst the more speculative.|$|R
40|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{the nature of}} reality (ontology), how reality should be researched (<b>methodology),</b> <b>and</b> what constitutes meaningful knowledge (epistemology) not merely invite philosophical deliberations, but also have practical implications. The paper argues that ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> often inform methodological choices. Certain methodological selections are reinforced by certain perspectives on philosophical questions as to what constitutes science and what qualifies as a scientific research. From a critical-realist perspective, this paper reflects on ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> implications of qualitative-quantitative divide and presents the arguments for and against combining qualitative and quantitative methods. While arguing for mainstreaming mixed-methods approach as a viable alternative in social sciences, the paper also discusses possible challenges of the approach...|$|R

Sandberg & Dall’Alba (2009) state that most empirical research is analyzed {{by taking on}} a building perspective. This statement is checked by doing a literature review.

Although some papers used the building mode and some used the dwelling mode, most research used a combination of both modes of strategy making. Besides concluding that a combination of both modes is used, this paper also explains why this is the case...|$|R
40|$|Günter Abel’s interpretationist {{philosophy}} {{is one of}} the most recent and original reflections on the phenomenon of interpretation. Gathering insights from various theoretical horizons (Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Goodman, Davidson), Abel believes that the interpretative activity is essentially inherent to all processes of the human spirit and identifies three fundamental forms of its realization. The introduction of these levels of interpretation and of the interpretative worlds associated with them allows for a differentiated response to the accusation of relativism that is often raised against any approach that confers a central ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>position</b> to interpretation. This article is a presentation and a critical evaluation of such an approach...|$|R

A number of questions have been raised that led to the formulation of the research question (page 63).

40|$|Although {{certain aspects}} of the work of Habermas have had much {{influence}} on emancipatory and action research, this article draws on a wider range of his thinking in order to explore how his ideas can inform the content and process of educational researcher development programmes. Habermas's theory of communicative action, his discourse ethics and his work on deliberative democracy suggest a process for examining perspectives, <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> the ‘truths’ offered by research on terms congruent with their epistemologies. The implications of the proposed framework are that a plurality of ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> should be presented in educational researcher development programmes and, for this to happen, representative voices need to be heard. The search for and construction of knowledge as a cumulative and revisable process of communicative action is proposed as a model for discourse on such programmes...|$|R
40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) are {{a valued}} research method in evidence-based practice in medical and clinical settings {{because they are}} associated with a particular ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> perspective that is situated within a positivist world view. It assumes that environments and variables can be controlled to establish cause-effect relationships. However, current theories of learning suggest that knowledge is socially constructed, and that learning occurs in open systems that cannot be controlled and manipulated as would be required in a RCT. They recognise the importance and influence of context on learning, which positivist research paradigms specifically aim to counter. We argue that RCTs are inappropriate in education research because they force one to take up ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> in a technical rationalist framework, which is at odds with current learning theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a {{plausible}} framework to initiate discussion regarding the concept of emergence in grounded theory. Using ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> to develop three research paradigms, and applying these paradigms to various uptakes of grounded theory demonstrates differences in the definition of emergence. Discovery emergence is presented as a unidirectional relationship between the constituent parts (data) and the emergent property (theory) observed by an external postpositivist grounded theorist. Mechanistic emergence is presented as having a bidirectional relationship between the constituent part (data) and the emergent property (theory) observed by an external constructionist grounded theorist. Finally, reflective emergence is presented as having a bidirectional relationship between the constituent parts (data) and the emergent property (theory) interpreted by an interpretivist grounded theorist...|$|R
30|$|The {{second stage}} {{examines}} the criticisms and classifies them {{into one of}} three hierarchical tiers, and where applicable, organises them into thematic groups. The highest tier contains criticisms related to the conceptualisation of Alexander’s theory and includes those associated with his idiosyncratic ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions.</b> The second tier focuses on criticisms relating to the actual development of his second theory and comprises three thematic groups relating to scholastic standards, the testing of patterns, and the reasoning supporting his decisions. The final or lowest tier documents criticisms relating {{to the implementation of}} the theory including claims that it is overly controlling, flawed, and unsuccessful. The three tiers which make up this classification system are not predetermined; rather they emerge organically from the criticisms which often focus on one of these aspects of Alexander’s theory.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} show that a deep strand running through Camus’ {{thinking}} and writing is what could be termed Camus’ own theory of ‘flesh’, comparable in its function and its scope to Merleau-Ponty’s famous notion. As is well known, in Merleau-Ponty the metaphor of ‘the flesh’ first serves ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> purposes. It is supposed to characterise whatMerleau-Ponty thinks is the actualmode of access to physical and symbolic worlds. Beyond its primary ontological purpose, Merleau-Ponty’s writings also explore the political and aesthetic implications of the notion. In this article, I attempt {{to show that}} Camus’ absurdist stance contained as its other side a positive ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>position,</b> comparable to Merleau-Ponty’s. I try to unveil this other side of the absurd in Camus’ early prose. In these texts, Camus’ unique version of sensualism comes to light most strikingly, as an indissolubly ontological and literary vision. That vision traverses Camus’ novels, and gives them much of their poetic force. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which {{triangulation}} takes place within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) process at the Bank of England. Triangulation is at its most basic, the mixing of two or more methods, investigators, theories, methodologies or data in a single investigation. More specifically, we argue for triangulation as a commitment in research design to the mixing of methods in the act of inference. The paper argues that there are many motivations for triangulation as well as types of triangulation. It is argued that there is evidence of extensive triangulation of different types within the MPC process. However, there is very little theoretical triangulation present; raising concerns about pluralism. Also, it is argued that the triangulation which occurs is mainly undertaken for pragmatic reasons and does not reflect other, coherent ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Existent {{taxonomies}} {{in accounting}} and finance {{are based on}} different ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions.</b> We state that, despite the inexistence of a right perspective {{as well as a}} proper research method within these domains, a reflection about such issues is crucial for the development of high-quality research. Several reasons justify this reflection. On the one hand, it is well-established that the research process is dependent on researcher’s assumption about the nature of reality. On the other hand, the clear definition of researchers’ philosophical perspective facilitates the understanding of their work by the remaining academic community. This paper aims at clarifying some of these issues in the accounting and finance domains. The paper also presents a two-dimension map describing the main characteristics regarding two extreme philosophical perspectivesthat constitute the basis of several taxonomies in accounting and finance research...|$|R

40|$|The ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> {{adopted by}} {{information}} systems design methods are incommensur-able when pushed to their extremes. Information systems research has therefore {{tended to focus}} on the similarities between different positions, usually in search of a single, unifying position. However, by focusing on the similari-ties, the clarity of argument provided by any one philoso-phical position is necessarily diminished. Consequently, researchers often treat the philosophical foundations of design methods as being of only minor importance. In this paper, we have deliberately chosen to focus on the differences between various philosophical positions. From this focus, we believe we can offer a clearer under-standing of the empirical behaviour of software as viewed from particular philosophical positions. Since the em-pirical evidence does not favour any single position, we conclude by arguing for the validity of ad hoc approaches to software design which we believe provides a stronger and more theoretically grounded approach to software design.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{limitation}} to epistemological claims to theory building prevalent in critical realist research. While accepting the basic ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions</b> of the perspective as developed by Roy Bhaskar, {{it is argued}} that application in social science has relied on sociological concepts to explain the underlying generative mechanisms, and that in many cases this has been subject to the effects of an anthropocentric constraint. A novel contribution to critical realist research comes from the work and ideas of Gregory Bateson. This is in service of two central goals of critical realism, namely an abductive route to theory building and a commitment to interdisciplinarity. Five aspects of Bateson’s epistemology are introduced: (1) difference, (2) logical levels of abstraction, (3) recursive causal loops, (4) the logic of metaphor, and (5) Bateson’s theory of mind. The comparison between Bateson and Bhaskar’s ideas is seen as a form of double description, illustrative of the point being raised. The paper concludes with an appeal to critical realists to start exploring the writing and outlook of Bateson himself...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to serve as a reflexive comment as to my ongoing empirical processes <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>position</b> concerning research on university graduatesáspirations and expectations of graduate employment.

Using educational research as a tangible basis, this paper will discuss the empirical application of the habitus in creating a break with common sense, whilst not losing itself to social theory. However, in an effort to depart from simply offering a comment on the need for the application of theory in educational research, this paper intends to demonstrate how the neo-positivist biographical narrative interview method can, contrary to Bourdieuś (1987) comments, illuminate the habitus, offering an opportunity for its empirical application in educational research and also for the wider academy.

30|$|The {{final stage}} of this {{procedure}} identifies and maps the antecedent and subsequent connections between criticisms and demonstrates that many criticisms of Alexander’s theory have roots in his idiosyncratic ontological <b>and</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>positions.</b> The phenomenon wherein several broad criticisms broach multiple hierarchical levels, offers a useful starting point for this mapping. In other cases, the literature discusses similar criticisms {{in the context of}} different hierarchical levels which provides a basis for mapping, while in a small number of cases a direct logical connection means that if the higher criticism occurs then the lower criticism also occurs. Regardless of which approach informs the identification of antecedent and subsequent criticisms, the decision regarding whether a connections exists is based on an interpretative analysis rather than a quantifiable metric. In some cases one criticism is the antecedent of a single criticism within a thematic group and in other cases one criticism is the antecedent of the entire group. These differences are represented in the diagrams by the connecting arrow either pointing to the circle containing a criticism number or the arrow pointing to the dotted outline of a thematic group.|$|R
