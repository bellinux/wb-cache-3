25|$|In March 1411 Adam {{was granted}} a royal pardon, which should have signalled his return to {{influence}}. However, in 1414 Thomas Arundel died and a major patron's influence was removed. Adam {{spent the rest of}} his life and career in relative obscurity. In 1423 he was the incumbent of St Cybi's Church, Llangybi, Monmouthshire, near his birthplace. He died in 1430 and was buried in the priory church at Usk, where his epitaph, composed in Welsh cywydd metre, can still be seen. His will, also preserved, includes bequests to Llandaff Cathedral and to friaries in Newport and Cardiff as well as to individual persons bearing Welsh names. He makes a legacy to his executor and one to a relative, one Edward ab Adam, quite a telling gift: Adam's own copy of Ranulf Higdon's Polychronicon, <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> own inspiration as a young boy. With it he must have left the material that formed his chronicle to 1421, which twenty years later was put in manuscript form.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert heavily praised DiCaprio's performance, and {{concluded}} [...] "This {{is not a}} major Spielberg film, although it is an effortlessly watchable one". Mick LaSalle said it was [...] "not Spielberg's best movie, but one of his smoothest and <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> friendliest. The colorful cinematography, smart performances and brisk tempo suggest a filmmaker subordinating every other impulse to the task of manufacturing pleasure." [...] Stephen Hunter believed DiCaprio shows [...] "the range and ease and cleverness that Martin Scorsese so underutilized in Gangs of New York".|$|E

500|$|Pundits {{and coaches}} {{sometimes}} characterized Turner as a quarterback {{who did not}} excel during practices, but executed well on game-day. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "He's pretty go-with-the-flow. And that's his greatest strength and <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> greatest weakness. The bottom line is, he plays well in games." [...] The Baltimore Sun wrote that he [...] "seems to play his best when it counts—and his worst when it doesn't." [...] Regarding the 2008 summer practices, offensive coordinator James Franklin said Turner ranked in the middle compared with Jordan Steffy and Josh Portis in terms of completion percentage, fewest interceptions, and [...] "explosive" [...] plays that gained 16 yards or more. Turner conceded that Steffy was a better game-planner during practices. Head coach Ralph Friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of Turners' practice, said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to Steffy prior to the 2008 season. Turner said, [...] "It lit a fire in me {{in the sense that}} I had to be ready." ...|$|E
500|$|DiCaprio's {{next film}} was The Great Gatsby, again with Baz Luhrmann (who {{directed}} him in Romeo + Juliet in 1996), {{an adaptation of}} F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, [...] "As for Leonardo DiCaprio, {{he is now the}} Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance – haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's [...] "Rhapsody in Blue"—DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, [...] "old sport," [...] a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as [...] "The movie's greatest and simplest special effect," [...] and states [...] "This is an iconic performance — <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> career best." [...] The film grossed $348 million worldwide and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.|$|E

[...] "He's just this lost soul– I don't think he's a bad kid, {{he just got}} mixed in the wrong crowd." [...] Paul {{elaborated}} on the character's background, saying, [...] "He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn't relate to his father, <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> father was too strict and too proper for Jesse." [...] Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to The Odd Couple.|$|E

[...] He later explained: [...] "based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them". He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> religious persuasion is different than mine! She [...] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!" ...|$|E

6000|$|For the {{direction}} of German character into these channels, the schools, of course, are chiefly responsible. Their everlasting teaching is duty. It is a fine ideal for any people; but before buckling to it, one would wish {{to have a clear}} understanding as to what this [...] "duty" [...] is. The German idea of it would appear to be: [...] "blind obedience to everything in buttons." [...] It is the antithesis of the Anglo-Saxon scheme; but as both the Anglo-Saxon and the Teuton are prospering, there must be good in both methods. Hitherto, the German has had the blessed fortune to be exceptionally well governed; if this continue, it will go well with him. When his troubles will begin will be when by any chance something goes wrong with the governing machine. But <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> method has the advantage of producing a continuous supply of good governors; it would certainly seem so.|$|E

"Well," [...] {{said the}} American, {{closing his eyes}} for the better {{enjoyment}} of the analysis, and giving a long, slow pull at his cigar, [...] "there might have been any one of several things.

Then, very likely he had no faith in Oiseau--knew it was probably a soap-mine, and was just putting him off till he could get away himself. Or, <b>maybe</b> <b>his</b> fever left him a little cracked, and he didn't know exactly what he was about. Then, again, if my theory of what the man was is true, I think that kind of fellow gets a twist simply from what he's done.
