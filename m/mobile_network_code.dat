The network operator that issued the SIM card can use this to have a phone connect to a preferred network, {{in order to make}} use of the best commercial agreement for the original network company instead of having to pay the network operator that the phone 'saw' first. This does not mean that a phone containing this SIM card can connect to a maximum of only 33 or 80 networks, but it means that the SIM card issuer can specify only up to that number of preferred networks; if a SIM is outside these preferred networks it will use the first or best available network.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Digital mobile {{broadcasting}} {{has received}} lots of attention recently. Due to broadcasting nature, packet loss {{is inevitable and}} the packet recovery issue needs to be addressed. The paper studies an integrated DVB-H and WiMAX mobile broadcasting architecture. DVB-H continually broadcasts videos to mobile devices. WiMAX serves as a recovery channel for mobile devices to request for retransmissions, which is modeled by repetitive frames, each with a submission period followed by a recovery period. Mobile devices submit their requests in the submission periods while the WiMAX network sends the lost packets in the recovery periods. To recover more urgent packets first, we develop a prioritized <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> scheme based on XOR coding, namely RGS. The RGS scheme constructs a weighted bipartite graph to reflect the influence of each coded packet and then adopts a greedy strategy to find a minimum dominating set of coded packets. Simulation results verify that RGS can improve recovery efficiency while {{reduce the number of}} packets being dropped due to missing deadlines.

A low complexity error concealment based on prediction of inter-block correlation is also introduced to effectively reconstruct the damaged image blocks caused by the residual errors.

In this paper we introduce NOMAD - negotiated object migration access deployment, which is a software architecture that provides support for mobile, distributed applications, allowing such applications to locate and obtain resources where and when they are needed based on an economic resource management model.

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>coding</b> {{is a new}} {{research}} area with potential to reduce network resources. With <b>network</b> <b>coding,</b> intermediate nodes forward packets that are linear combinations of previously received packets.

5000|$|A mobile {{country code}} (MCC) {{is used in}} {{combination}} with a <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> <b>code</b> (MNC) (a combination known as an [...] "MCC/MNC tuple") to uniquely identify a mobile network operator (carrier) using the GSM (including GSM-R), UMTS, and LTE public land mobile networks. Some but not all CDMA, iDEN, and satellite mobile networks are identified with an MCC/MNC tuple as well. For WiMAX networks, a globally unique Broadband Operator ID {{can be derived from}} the MCC/MNC tuple. TETRA networks use the mobile country code from ITU-T Recommendation E.212 together with a 10-bit binary <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> <b>code.</b> However, a TETRA network may be assigned an E.212 network code as well. Some network operators do not have their own radio access network at all. These are called mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) and are marked in the tables as such.

5000|$|The {{transcoder}} {{is responsible}} for transcoding the voice channel coding between the coding used in the <b>mobile</b> <b>network,</b> and the <b>coding</b> used by the world's terrestrial circuit-switched network, the Public Switched Telephone Network. Specifically, GSM uses a regular pulse excited-long term prediction (RPE-LTP) coder for voice data between the mobile device and the BSS, but pulse code modulation (A-law or μ-law standardized in ITU G.711) upstream of the BSS. RPE-LPC coding results in a data rate for voice of 13 kbit/s where standard PCM coding results in 64 kbit/s. Because of this change in data rate for the same voice call, the transcoder also has a buffering function so that PCM 8-bit words can be recoded to construct GSM 20 ms traffic blocks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—While {{demands on}} video traffic over <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> have been souring, the {{wireless}} link capacity cannot {{keep up with}} the traffic demand. The gap between the traffic demandandthe link capacity, along with time-varying link conditions, results in poor service quality of video streaming over <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> such as long buffering time and intermittent disruptions. Leveraging the cloud computing technology, we propose a new mobile video streaming framework, dubbed AMES-Cloud, which has two main parts: adaptive mobile video streaming (AMoV) and efficient social video sharing (ESoV). AMoV and ESoV construct a private agent to provide video streaming services efficiently for each mobile user. For a given user, AMoV lets her private agent adaptively adjust her streaming flow with a scalable video coding technique based on the feedback of link quality. Likewise, ESoV monitors the social <b>network</b> interactions among <b>mobile</b> users, and their private agents try to prefetch video content in advance. We implement a prototype of the AMES-Cloud framework to demonstrate its performance. It is shown that the private agents in the clouds can effectively provide the adaptive streaming, and perform video sharing (i. e., prefetching) based on the social network analysis.
