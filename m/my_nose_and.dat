25|$|Westbrook has {{featured}} in several documentaries, including {{an interview with}} British journalist Martin Bashir for the Tonight with Trevor McDonald show and Danniella Westbrook: <b>My</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Me for Channel 4. In April 2006, Danniella released an autobiography entitled The Other Side of Nowhere, which gives a depiction of her struggles with cocaine.|$|E
25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

50|$|Burke wrote two autobiographies, {{both with}} Cameron Van Shippe, With a Feather on <b>My</b> <b>Nose</b> (Appleton 1949) <b>and</b> With Powder on <b>My</b> <b>Nose</b> (Coward McCann, 1959).|$|R
50|$|Judge's Oath:I do solemnly {{swear to}} objectively and subjectively {{evaluate}} each Barbeque meat that {{is presented to}} <b>my</b> eyes, <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>my</b> hands <b>and</b> my palate. I accept my duty to be an Official KCBS Certified Judge, so that truth, justice, excellence in Barbeque and the American Way of Life may be strengthened and preserved forever.|$|R
60|$|The Ross of Mull, which I had now got upon, was rugged and trackless, {{like the}} isle I had just left; being all bog, and briar, and big stone. There may be roads {{for them that}} know that country well; but for my part I had no better guide than <b>my</b> own <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> no other {{landmark}} than Ben More.|$|R
2500|$|In 1995, Lloyd {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Dermot Reeve, then coach of Somerset, while in the Old Trafford committee room. He stated, according to Reeve in his biography Winnings Ways: [...] "I don't like you Reeve. I never have liked you. You get right up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> if you come anywhere near me, I'll rearrange yours." ...|$|E
2500|$|I think you're {{a pretty}} smart boy. I may not talk very good, Mister, but I {{know how to}} take care of smart boys. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you a little secret. I hate your guts, you college son-of-a-bitch! You think you're better than I am! You think you're better because you've had {{everything}} handed to you. Let me tell you something, Mister – I've worked since I was ten years old, and all my life I've known you superior bastards. I knew you people when I was a kid in Boston and I worked in eating-places and you ordered me around … [...] "Oh bus-boy! My friend here seems to have thrown up on the table. Clean it up, please!" [...] I started going to sea as a steward and I worked for you then … [...] "Steward, take my magazine out to the deck chair!" [...] … [...] "Steward, I don't like your looks. Please keep out of my way as much as possible!" [...] Well, I took that crap! I took that for years from pimple-faced bastards who weren't good enough to wipe <b>my</b> <b>nose!</b> <b>And</b> now I don't have to take it any more! There's a war on, by God, and I'm the Captain and you can wipe my nose! The worst thing I can do to you is to keep you on this ship! And that's where you're going to stay! Now get out of here.|$|E
60|$|The {{wind blew}} fine and keen, in the sunshine, across the snow. I blew <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> {{prepared}} to depart.|$|E
60|$|I {{was beaten}} and buffeted, smashed under {{by the great}} San Pablo whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow tide-rip waves which flung {{themselves}} into <b>my</b> eyes, <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> mouth. Then the strange sucks would grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce boiling, where, even as I tried to catch my breath, a great whitecap would crash down upon my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is he?" [...] said Lady Thompson, looking {{about her}} {{as though she}} {{expected}} to find him hidden under the furniture. [...] "And {{how did you manage}} to become entangled with him, you sly girl, under <b>my</b> very <b>nose?</b> <b>And</b> who is he? One of those bowing and scraping Italians, I suppose, who think you'll get my money. Tell me the truth at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose," [...] said Anne decidedly, [...] "I wouldn't--but there! I won't {{say what}} I {{was going to}} because it was {{extremely}} uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with <b>my</b> own <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> that's vanity. I'm afraid I {{think too much about}} <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to me. Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit. That's something to remember for our woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams." ...|$|R
60|$|I waked {{brushing}} a {{fly from}} <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> saw the Club waiter {{set out the}} evening papers on the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for me, I blew <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> {{going up}} to the {{rhinoceros}} sat on his head, and reflected that I had done a capital morning's shooting." ...|$|E
60|$|There was myself. I {{spoke of}} myself;--of myself, of myself, of myself;--of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> I spoke of myself.|$|E
60|$|Very well. Cut off all my fingers. I am I. The {{spirit is}} entire. Cut off both hands. Cut off both arms at the shoulder-sockets. Cut off both legs at the hip-sockets. And I, the unconquerable and indestructible I, survive. Am I any the less for these mutilations, for these subtractions of the flesh? Certainly not. Clip my hair. Shave from me with sharp razors <b>my</b> lips, <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>my</b> ears--ay, <b>and</b> tear out {{the eyes of}} me by the roots; and there, mewed in that featureless skull that is {{attached}} to a hacked and mangled torso, there in that cell of the chemic flesh, will still be I, unmutilated, undiminished.|$|R
6000|$|... "My only comfort," [...] {{she said}} to Meg, with tears in her eyes, [...] "is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses {{whenever}} I'm naughty, as Maria Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feel that I can bear even <b>my</b> flat <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it." ...|$|R
60|$|After that a {{gas tank}} and a pump were placed {{beside me and}} a set of rubber tubes {{fastened}} tight over <b>my</b> mouth <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> Even those who have never taken gas can realize how ridiculously simple this is.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He did,' {{answered}} Fledgeby. 'The assassin. Lammle. He {{rubbed it}} into my mouth and up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> down my throat--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah--h--h--h! Ugh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{she told}} me to <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b> <b>And</b> the fat man murmured bitterly già! già!--ay! ay! Her {{impertinence}} and the fat man's quiet bitterness stirred my bile. Has not this song been sung at me once too often, by these people? ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{got home}} I undressed and rubbed myself down with whisky, put my feet {{in hot water}} and a mustard-plaster on my chest, had a basin of gruel {{and a glass of}} hot brandy-and-water, tallowed <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what can}} be more worthy of man's admiration and respectful affection?" [...] I argued, as I {{recovered}} my perpendicular, coughed the snow out of <b>my</b> mouth <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> rubbed {{it out of my}} eyes; [...] "what more worthy of true-hearted devotion than this--this--creature of--of light; this noble child of nature--this Queen of the Wilderness?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Openly Jewish, Feldman {{spoke out}} against {{antisemitism}} in the women's movement:"As a kid, I was the only Jew on my block to keep <b>my</b> own <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> in the Movement's early days, I {{was the only one}} to keep my own name. Women were changing their names if they had a 'man' ending. They said it was to deny the patriarchy, but they were also denying their Jewish identities. Feldman is a Jewish name, not a male name. When they asked why I didn't change it, I answered, 'Why don't Margie Adam and Cris Williamson change theirs?'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} song: [...] "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" [...] is really sarcastic. It's really {{directed}} towards {{the people that}} we've heard year after year, record after record, saying, 'Oh, put out another record like The Fall Of Ideals. We've done that, {{and even if we}} did it, some purist would say it's tarnished anyway because we've already done it. You can't win, so (the song) is kind of like flicking <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at them <b>and</b> giving them the bird." ...|$|R
6000|$|We had not {{proceeded}} {{more than}} a mile when suddenly I felt a very gentle tap on the end of <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> at the same moment the young lady turned her head towards me and exclaimed: [...] "It's going to rain! I felt a drop!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For two nights, Heaven-born, he was pagal' said Faiz Ullah. 'Look at <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> {{consider}} {{the eye of}} the policeman. He beat us with his bound hands; but we sat upon him, Heaven-born, and though his words were tez, we sweated him. Heaven-born, never has been such a sweat! He is weaker now than a child; but the fever has gone out of him, by the grace of God. There remains only <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> {{the eye of the}} constabeel. Sahib, shall I ask for my dismissal because my Sahib has beaten me?' And Faiz Ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on Scott's chest {{to be sure that the}} fever was all gone, ere he went out to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose.|$|E
6000|$|... "So say I, sir," [...] {{one of the}} men grumbled; [...] "if it had {{not been}} for your lantern I should have been torn to pieces. As it is, I aint sure whether my eyes aint gone, and <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> cheeks are {{scratched}} as if I had been fighting with a mad cat." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} go very fast because I was so dreadfully tired; also I did not like swimming, and the cold waves broke over my head, making the cut in <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> smart <b>and</b> filling <b>my</b> eyes with {{something}} that stung them. I could not see far either, nor did I know where I was going. I knew nothing except I was about to die, and that soon everything would be at an end; men, dogs--everything, yes, even Tom. I wanted things {{to come to an}} end. I had suffered so dreadfully, life was so horrible, I was so very tired. I felt that it was better to die and have done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] he said; [...] "I don't go in {{for your}} subtleties. I use <b>my</b> eyes <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> I {{can see that the}} woman {{will never be able to}} go on feeding the baby in the {{neurotic}} state she's in. It's a matter of health for both of them." ...|$|R
60|$|They came {{quite close}} to me, rubbing their muzzles against <b>my</b> body <b>and</b> <b>nosing</b> for the bits of food it was always my {{practice}} to reward them with. Opening the gates I ordered the two great beasts to pass out, and then slipping quietly after them I closed the portals behind me.|$|R
6000|$|Kagax listened a moment, {{a ferocious}} {{grin on his}} pointed face; then he stole towards the sound. [...] "I {{intended}} to kill those young hares first," [...] he thought, [...] "but this fool squirrel will stretch my legs better, and point <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> get the sleep out of me--There he is, in the big spruce!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stared at}} it again and again. It {{seemed to me to}} be touched up a good deal; it was glazed as well as framed, and the glass blurred some of the details. But there unmistakably was my face, my eyes, <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> mouth, my head and hand, posed for a {{professional}} photographer. And I had never posed so for any photographer.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be {{the name}} of the Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> I knocked him sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|And oh--ho-o! how {{my spirit}} seemed to gush out through <b>my</b> mouth <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> or {{out at the}} top of my head, when the cold water encircled my neck as I lost my footing altogether, and struck out with my right hand, endeavouring the while to support my rod in the left! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Turnbull, {{advancing}} on him {{swiftly and}} with animated gestures, [...] "why does teething hurt? Why do growing pains hurt? Why are measles catching? Why does a rose have thorns? Why do rhinoceroses have horns? Why is the horn {{on the top}} of the nose? Why haven't I a horn {{on the top of}} <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> eh?" [...] <b>And</b> he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the Creator.|$|R
60|$|I {{caught one}} cold on Wednesday last, another on Thursday, two on Friday, four on Saturday, {{and one at}} every station between this and Ingleborough on Monday. I never was in such ignoble misery of cold. I've no cough to speak of, nor {{anything}} worse than usual {{in the way of}} sneezing, but my hands are cold, my pulse nowhere, <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> tickles <b>and</b> wrings me, my ears sing--like kettles, my mouth has no taste, my heart no hope of ever being good for anything, any more. I never passed such a wretched morning by my own fireside in all my days, and I've quite a fiendish pleasure in telling you all this, and thinking how miserable you'll be too. Oh me, if I ever get to feel like myself again, won't I take care of myself.|$|R
