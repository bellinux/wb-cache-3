Romania’s absorption into the Soviet camp led to deterioration in the bilateralrelationship, as successive Romanian communist leaders imposed a totalitarian system and strictlimits on contacts with Americans and other Westerners. However, bilateral relations with Romaniabegan to improve in the early 1960s under Gheorghiu-Dej with the signing of an agreement providingfor partial settlement of Americanproperty claims. Cultural, scientific, andeducational exchanges were initiated, andin 1964 the legations of both nations werepromoted to full embassies. Ceausescu’scalculated distancing of Romania fromthe Soviet foreign policy line, includingBucharest’s diplomatic recognition ofIsrael and denunciation of the 1968Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia pavedthe way for President Nixon’s officialvisit to Romania in August 1969. Despitepolitical differences, high-level contactscontinued between U.S. and Romanianleaders throughout the decade of the1970s, culminating in the 1973 state visitto Washington by the Ceausescus. In1972, a consular convention to facilitateprotection of citizens and their propertyin both countries was signed. OverseasPrivate Investment Corporation (OPIC) facilities were granted, and Romania became eligible for U.S.Export-Import Bank credits. A trade agreement signed in April 1975 accorded Most Favored Nation(MFN) status to Romania under section 402 of the Trade Reform Act of 1974 (the Jackson-Vanikamendment that links MFN to a country’s performance on emigration). This status was renewedyearly after Congressional review of a presidential determination that Romania was making progresstoward freedom of emigration.In the mid-1980s, criticism of Romania’s deteriorating human rights record, particularly regardingits mistreatment of religious and ethnic minorities, spurred attempts by Congress to withdraw MFNstatus.

In pursuit of my goal of empirically establishing the results of the U. S. 's <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> of imports from China, this study has three technical objectives: First, since both import demand and export supply influences determine equilibrium price and quantity, based on the paper by Mendez and Rousslang (1989), simultaneous equation estimating methods have been used when dealing with the "simultaneity" problem that has plagued previous similar studies. Second, based on the fact that sales of imported goods are sensitive to price, disaggregated elasticities of the U. S. import demand for Chinese goods and of China's export supply to the U. S. are estimated by using Edward Leamer' s method (1981). This enables me to avoid "the errors in observation" that have distorted previous, similar studies for other country's trade. Third, instead of focusing on only one country, the estimated elasticities have been used to assess the welfare effects of implementing <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> for both the U. S. and China. In conclusion, these results are analyzed to provide both other scholars and policymakers a better understanding of the costs of terminating <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> of China's exports...|$|E

In a traditional competitive equilibrium framework, MFN gives benefits to small countries in being able to free ride on bilateral tariff concessions exchanged between larger countries in GATT/WTO negotiating rounds.

In a co-operative bargaining framework in which trade policies are jointly set, MFN changes the threat point and hence affects the bargaining solution. We use a calibrated numerical model of global trade in which we compute all three solution concepts and compare MFN and non MFN equilibria for each.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a surge in {{bilateral}} and regional trade arrangements between developed and developing countries, which are known as North-South RTAs. Under the current legal system of the WTO, North-South RTAs are governed by Article XXIV of the GATT or Article V of the GATS, which means such RTAs must be reciprocal and must cover substantially all the trade. On the other hand, there is another category of rules on RTAs based on the so-called Enabling Clause, which, in exceptional circumstances, provides special and differential treatment (SDT) for RTAs among developing countries.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty prescribe most-favoured-nation (<b>MFN)</b> <b>treatment.</b> The right to <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> concerns the issue whether taxpayers resident in one Member State can “cherry-pick” the most beneficial tax treaty available to other taxpayers. Two issues of fundamental impor-tance are {{examined in this}} thesis. First, whether a resident of a Member State (A) who receives income in another Member State (B), can claim from that state, the most beneficial tax treaty available to a resident of a third Member State (C). Second, whether a resident can claim from his state of residence (A), the same tax treatment as provided in a tax treaty concluded by his state of residence and another Member State (C), when this tax treaty provides better treatment in terms of avoiding double taxa-tion {{in the state of}} residence than the tax treaty applicable to the source of income (B). The ECJ has held that discrimination arises only through the application of different rules to comparable situations or the application of the same rule to different situa-tions. The current state of EC law prohibits unequal treatment of residents and non-residents as well as residents who have exercised their rights to free movement in comparison to residents who have not. The condition is that they must be considered to be in comparable situations and that there is no objective difference to justify the difference in treatment. The ECJ has so far not ruled on the MFN issue. It is there-fore uncertain as to whether Member States are obligated to treat; 1) different non-resident taxpayers equally and, 2) whether Member States are prohibited from treat-ing their own residents differently when they exercise their rights to free movement in different Member States. This thesis identifies the requirements for the application of <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> and ex-amines in which tax treaty provisions it is possible to apply <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment.</b> The ECJ, has in its case law, concluded that the application of tax treaties must be exer-cised in accordance EC law. It can be argued that a well-functioning internal market cannot allow bilateral tax treaties to provide preferential tax treatment to residents of one Member State, while denying it to residents of the remaining Member States. However, the application of <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment</b> could have far-reaching ramifications on the Member States’ existing tax treaty network. It is therefore fair to assume, as has been stated in other doctrinal opinions, that the ECJ will approach this issue care-fully when providing its interpretation on the matter...|$|E

40|$|The United States {{and other}} industrialized {{countries}} were once strong proponents of generalized, unconditional Most-Favored-Nation (<b>MFN)</b> <b>treatment</b> as a fundamental GATT rule.

Two large countries (the North) negotiate a trade agreement {{with each other and}} with a continuum of smaller countries (the South).

40|$|AbstractMitochondrial {{dysfunction}} is {{an early}} pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying mechanisms and strategies to repair it remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} the direct consequences and potential mechanisms of mitochondrial functional defects associated with abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in AD. Using cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) neurons with incorporated platelet mitochondria from AD and age-matched non-AD human subjects into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) -depleted neuronal cells, we observed that AD cybrid cells had significant changes in morphology and function; such changes associate with altered expression and distribution of dynamin-like protein (DLP 1) and mitofusin 2 (<b>Mfn</b> 2). <b>Treatment</b> with antioxidant protects against AD mitochondria-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and mitochondrial fission-fusion imbalances. Notably, inhibition of ERK activation not only attenuates aberrant mitochondrial morphology and function but also restores the mitochondrial fission and fusion balance. These effects suggest a role of oxidative stress-mediated ERK signal transduction in modulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion events. Further, blockade of the mitochondrial fission protein DLP 1 by a genetic manipulation with a dominant negative DLP 1 (DLP 1 K 38 A), its expression with siRNA-DLP 1, or inhibition of mitochondrial division with mdivi- 1 attenuates mitochondrial functional defects observed in AD cybrid cells. Our results provide new insights into mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from changes in the ERK-fission/fusion (DLP 1) machinery and signaling pathway. The protective effect of mdivi- 1 and inhibition of ERK signaling on maintenance of normal mitochondrial structure and function holds promise as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AD...|$|R

Such contacts are formed between mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM), specialized subregions of ER, and the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). We have previously shown increased expression of MAM-associated proteins and enhanced ER to mitochondria Ca 2 + transfer in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyloid β- peptide (Aβ) related neuronal models. Here, we report that siRNA knockdown of mitofusin- 2 (Mfn 2), a protein that {{is involved in the}} tethering of ER and mitochondria, leads to increased contact between the two organelles. Cells depleted in Mfn 2 showed increased ER to mitochondria Ca 2 + transfer and longer stretches of ER forming contacts with OMM. Interestingly, increased contact resulted in decreased concentrations of intra- and extracellular Aβ 40 and Aβ 42. Analysis of γ-secretase protein expression, maturation and activity revealed that the low Aβ concentrations were a result of impaired γ-secretase complex function. APP, BACE 1 and neprilysin expression as well as neprilysin activity were not affected by <b>Mfn</b> 2 siRNA <b>treatment.</b> In summary, our data show that modulation of ER-mitochondria contact affects γ-secretase activity and Aβ generation.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can undergo structural remodeling in order to cope with these everchanging metabolic demands. However, {{the process by which}} mitochondrial morphology impacts insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle cells remains uncertain. To address this question, we silenced the mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn 2 and Opa 1 and assessed insulin-dependent responses in L 6 rat skeletal muscle cells. We found that mitochondrial fragmentation attenuates insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, glucose uptake and cell respiratory rate. Importantly, we found that insulin induces a transient rise in mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake, which was attenuated by silencing Opa 1 or <b>Mfn</b> 2. Moreover, <b>treatment</b> with Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake, impairs Akt signaling without affecting mitochondrial dynamics. All together, these results suggest that control of mitochondrial Ca 2 uptake by mitochondrial morphology is a key event for insulininduced glucose uptake.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the use of}} anti-dumping {{regulation in}} the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with specific reference to Botswana. Dumping takes place where products are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported {{from one country to}} another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country. Anti-dumping duties are an internationally-recognised exception to three core WTO principles namely, bound tariff commitments, most-favoured-nation <b>MFN)</b> and national <b>treatment.</b> The use of anti-dumping in SACU has always been in accordance with existing WTO rules. The new SACU Agreement has important implications for the anti-dumping regime within the customs union. It changed the way in which tariff decisions, including anti-dumping tariffs, are made and it also requires member states to develop legislation on contingency trade remedies such as anti-dumping for the region and to establish national bodies to administer these remedies within different countries. The SACU council has given mandate to the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC) to undertake all trade remedies investigations and imposition of the necessary duties. From the inception of ITAC till now ninety-five percent (95 %) of all anti-dumping applications filed at ITAC alleging dumping are instituted by South Africa industries. Thus, only five percent (5 %) of all anti-dumping applications are from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS countries). The findings in this paper reveal that Botswana has never filed an application seeking protection of any of its industries. In terms of Article 14 of the SACU Agreement Botswana {{is in the process of}} establishing its national body like ITAC. The argument is that, since Botswana has never filed for any trade remedy how effective will this national body going to be? Therefore, critically analyzing the use of anti-dumping regulation is very crucial for Botswana as a SACU member. Such analysis will help assess the effectiveness of SACU institutions such as the tariff board and the Botswana national body to be established. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

It traces the evolution of the postwar trading regime from {{the early decades of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that were dominated by the United States and the European Communities to the new World Trade Organization (WTO) in which developing countries have begun to play a more important role, especially in the current Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTNs). The paper discusses the substantive and tactical reasons why the Doha Round has progressed so grudgingly and is unlikely to achieve its ambitious objectives. It then examines why developing countries increasingly have turned to RTAs to complement WTO talks, whether these pacts benefit or hinder MTNs, and how RTAs affect the influence of developing countries in the WTO. The final section of the paper looks at the WTO going forward and posits that, after the Doha Round, the trading system in the 21 st century requires substantial reform. The problems of the Doha Round and the proliferation of regionalism confront WTO members with three central challenges: First, multilateralize multilateralism. There are a vast number of exceptions that take the WTO far away from the ideal of a universal system with a single set of rules. The paper suggests that officials focus on the broad exceptions to most-favored nation (<b>MFN)</b> and national <b>treatment</b> in Articles XX and XXI, especially the provisions covering border security and environmental issues. Second, multilateralize regionalism. The challenge is to make the design and implementation of RTAs more WTO-friendly. The paper calls for greater transparency of RTAs through more frequent and rigorous WTO reporting requirements, and new disciplines on discriminatory rules of origin. The paper offers two correctives: cut MFN tariffs and thus reduce the margin of preference for RTA members; or, alternatively, require that RTA members harmonize and lower the MFN tariffs down to the level of the lowest rate applied by any of the RTA members. Third, modernize multilateralism. The WTO agenda needs to be refocused on the problems of international commerce in the 21 st century. WTO rules on taxes and subsidies need to be recast to cover concerns about currency manipulation, regulatory abuse or neglect, and labor market practices as well as to meet the new challenges of climate change initiatives. In addition, WTO members will have to address trade and security linkages before pre-shipment inspection and visa requirements become major obstacles to international flows of goods, services, and people. To do so, the WTO will have to collaborate more effectively with other international economic organizations. " [author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|The South African Government {{publicly}} {{announced its}} intention to table the Regulation of Land Holdings Bill in Parliament soon, {{as part of their}} land reform priority. This potential new law aims to prohibit foreign ownership of agricultural land and to place ceilings on the size of agricultural land that citizens and foreigners may own. Foreigners will be allowed to conclude long term leases. Some parties most likely to be affected by this proposed new Bill are South Africa's fellow WTO Members in services trade and investors from its BIT partner countries. As a WTO Member and BIT partner, SA undertook various contractual obligations and commitments. The primary objective of this study is therefore to determine whether, by promulgating the proposed Bill, South Africa might be violating any of these obligations or commitments. This is done by considering firstly the policy and constitutional background of the Bill in light of the General and Specific GATS commitments such as the <b>MFN,</b> Transparency, National <b>Treatment</b> and Market Access Commitments. The outcome of this analysis shows that South Africa may violate its National Treatment and Market Access Specific Commitments by imposing the ban on foreign ownership of agricultural land. This is because those foreign services providers intending to own (as opposed to leasing) agricultural land to establish commercial presence in South Africa, will be prohibited from doing so - despite South Africa's GATS Schedule of Specific Commitments not indicating any such land ownership restrictions either horizontally or sector-specifically. Examples of affected service sectors are the Tourism, Manufacturing and Construction sectors. It is then concluded that (i) South Africa could potentially raise the public order General Exception against any possible violation claims; but (ii) that South Africa should in the alternative, rather consider modifying or withdrawing some of its GATS Commitments. The protections which South Africa's BITs provide are then analysed in light of what is publicly known about the proposed Bill. It is concluded, for example, that the restriction of the property rights of existing foreign owners of agricultural land in South Africa by restricting their rights to dispose of their land to South Africans only – may constitute indirect expropriation for which they should be compensated in terms of relevant BITs. Although the country's investment policy vis a vis BIT has changed leading to the termination of, for example, some European-South African BITs, these agreements all contain sunset clauses opening up the country for potential investor-state arbitration claims for up to 20 years. The thesis concludes with the recommendation that South Africa carefully considers the implications of potential claims from its WTO and BIT partners and in also, other alternative land reform options...|$|R
40|$|WTO Members {{have more}} leeway under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to elude the WTO's basic most favoured nation (MFN) {{obligation}} than in merchandise trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In particular, under the Annex on Article II Exemptions, each Member had the one-off opportunity [...] at the GATS' {{entry into force}} in 1995 or, if later, the date of WTO accession [...] to seek cover for the retention of whatever departures from <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment.</b> Such MFN exemptions are subject to relatively soft disciplines only. The relevant Annex provides that their duration should not exceed 10 years in principle, and that they be subject to negotiation in any subsequent trade round. In addition, the GATS allows for departures from <b>MFN</b> <b>treatment,</b> which {{are not subject to}} time constraints, including for Economic Integration Agreements and recognition measures related to standards, certificates and the like. Over 90 WTO Members (counting EC 12 as one) have listed MFN exemptions for close to 500 measures in total. This article discusses their role within the structure of the GATS as well as governments' underlying policy intentions: grandfathering clause or active/offensive policy tool? It further traces the sectoral and modal patterns of current exemptions, their use by different groups of Members and the [...] limited [...] changes offered in the services negotiations to date. The authors submit that the non-availability of new exemptions, including for measures that had escaped Members' attention at the relevant point in time, could have added to the popularity of potential substitutes (including in the context of Economic Integration Agreements), promoted an excessively broad interpretation of existing exemptions and discouraged governments from rescinding those that had served their initial purpose. A more flexible approach might thus be warranted; possible options are being discussed. Oxford University Press 2009, all rights reserved, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
