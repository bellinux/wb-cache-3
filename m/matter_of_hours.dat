The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a team to Hunan to investigate the allegations, and issued a notice stating that anyone found to be covering up any damage details would be held accountable.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{sought to}} invade Egypt {{as the first}} step in a {{campaign}} against British India, part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b> Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.|$|E
5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was planned in a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> following {{a meeting between}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, during which Holbrooke urged Tuđman to seize Prijedor and threaten to capture Banja Luka from the VRS, short of actually seizing the city, as he believed such a development would force Bosnian Serb leaders to the negotiating table. Inadequate planning and preparation, combined with flawed military intelligence on the defending force and disregard for the high water level of the Una and Sava rivers, led to {{a high number of}} casualties and little success. The offensive was called off one day after it was launched and the bridgeheads were evacuated. The HV ultimately blamed Major General Vinko Vrbanac for its failure. Vrbanac had authorized the offensive instead of deferring to the Chief of the General Staff General Zvonimir Červenko.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after midnight, in {{the first}} minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza {{organized}} their troops and told them of their plan {{to take over the}} government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He then told the soldiers that they had to act now to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b> Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.|$|E

5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E

40|$|Rigorous simulation, {{which in}} concept is nearly linear in CPU time with micro-Ampere beam currents, has been {{developed}} for analyzing statistical electron-electron interactions in lens free regions joined by ideal lenses and apertures. The simulation method is based on combining fast multipole acceleration (FMA) with modifications to a message passing interface for use on multi-processor and network of workstations (NOW). As test cases, the distribution of scattered electrons versus deviation from focus is given as well as results for the interaction between simultaneously imaged spots. The performance improvement per level of spatial division was only about a factor of 2 instead of the expected factor of 8 due to the pencil nature of the beam. An FMA method that adapts to beam density and geometry is needed. It is projected to be possible to simulate a 30 uA beam current on a quad-Pentium Pro machine in half a day and in <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hour</b> on a network of workstation. 1 I...|$|R
