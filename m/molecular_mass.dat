5|$|In ES MS spectrum, a given {{oligonucleotide}} {{generates a}} set of ions that correspond to different ionization states of the compound. Thus, the oligonucleotide with <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> M generates ions with masses (M– nH)/n where M is the <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> of the oligonucleotide {{in the form of}} a free acid (all negative charges of internucleosidic phosphodiester groups are neutralized with H+), n is the ionization state, and H is the atomic mass of hydrogen (1 Da). Most useful for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5. Software supplied with the more recently manufactured instruments is capable of performing a deconvolution procedure that is, it finds peaks of ions that belong to the same set and derives the <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> of the oligonucleotide.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} {{synthesized}} protein can {{be measured}} {{by the number of}} amino acids it contains and by its total <b>molecular</b> <b>mass,</b> which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of protein increases from Archaea, Bacteria to Eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respecitvely) due bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.|$|E

The mature APOA5 protein spans a length of 366 amino acid residues, of which 23 amino acids code for the signal peptide.

5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's <b>molecular</b> <b>mass.</b> In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its <b>molecular</b> <b>mass,</b> so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E

40|$|The <b>molecular</b> <b>masses</b> of the UDP-glucuronyltransferases were {{determined}} by means of radiation-inactivation analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated lyophilized rat liver microsomal preparations using a calibrated 60 Co source. Bilirubin glucuronidation with formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide is catalyzed by a 41, 500 -Da enzyme; conversion of bilirubin mono- to diglucuronide is catalyzed by a 175, 000 -Da enzyme. The glucuronidation of estrone and testosterone is mediated by enzymes with <b>molecular</b> <b>masses</b> of 73, 500 and 142, 000 Da, respectively, and the glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol and phenolphthalein is mediated by enzymes with <b>molecular</b> <b>masses</b> of 109, 000 and 159, 000 Da, respectively. Our results show that UDP-glucuronyltransferase consists of a heterogenous group of enzymes with strikingly different <b>molecular</b> <b>masses.</b> Our data furthermore suggest that these enzymes may be oligomers composed of one to four subunits with similar <b>molecular</b> <b>masses.</b> Based on these findings, a molecular model of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase is proposed, consisting of four subunits. For bilirubin diglucuronide formation, the complete tetrameric enzyme is required, whereas formation of monoglucuronide can be mediated by a single subunit. The monomeric monoglucuronide-forming enzyme is resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate, treatment whereas the tetrameric diglucuronide-forming enzyme is labile, but once inactivated, the diglucuronide-forming enzyme can be reconstituted by decreasing the sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration by means of dialysi...|$|R

5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to <b>molecular</b> <b>mass.</b> After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process.

5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E

5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low <b>molecular</b> <b>mass,</b> it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, the <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> {{of a small}} {{molecule}} {{is usually}} reported as the monoisotopic mass, that is, {{the mass of the}} molecule containing only the most common isotope of each element. Note that this also differs subtly from the <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> in that the choice of isotopes is defined and thus is a single specific <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> of the many possible. The masses used to compute the monoisotopic <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> are found on a table of isotopic masses and are not found on a typical periodic table. The average <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> is often used for larger molecules since molecules with many atoms are unlikely to be composed exclusively of the most abundant isotope of each element. A theoretical average <b>molecular</b> <b>mass</b> can be calculated using the standard atomic weights found on a typical periodic table, since there {{is likely to be a}} statistical distribution of atoms representing the isotopes throughout the molecule.
