[...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate.

A fully electronic kit weighs much less and takes up less space to transport than an acoustic kit and it can be set up more quickly.

2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, {{how well it}} agrees with human judgments. This is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts. However, according to research human raters typically only agree about 80% of the time (see Inter-rater reliability). Thus, a program which achieves 70% accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans, even though such accuracy <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> impressive. If a program were [...] "right" [...] 100% of the time, humans would still disagree with it about 20% of the time, since they disagree that much about any answer. On the other hand, computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors, and thus the figures are not entirely comparable. For instance, a computer system will have trouble with negations, exaggerations, jokes, or sarcasm, which typically are easy to handle for a human reader: some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human. In general, the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question, mostly since the simple one-dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying {{about the effect of}} public discourse on e.g. brand or corporate reputation.|$|E

This paper studies the problem of efficiently identifying and correcting unsound workflow views with minimal changes. In particular, given a workflow view, we wish to split each unsound composite task into the minimal number of tasks, such that the resulting view is sound. We prove that this problem is NP-hard by reduction from independent set. We then propose two local optimality conditions (weak and strong), and design polynomial time algorithms for correcting unsound views to meet these conditions. Experiments show that our proposed algorithms are effective and efficient, and that the strong local optimality algorithm produces better solutions than the weak local optimality algorithm with little processing overhead...|$|R
