40|$|Abstract—Pulse trains from {{a number}} of {{different}} sources are often received on the one communication channel. It is then of interest to identify which pulses are from which source, based on different source characteristics. This sorting task is termed deinterleaving. In this paper we next propose time-domain techniques for deinterleaving pulse trains from a finite number of periodic sources based on the time of arrival (TOA) and pulse energy, if available, of the pulses received on the one communication channel. We formulate the pulse train deinterleaving problem as a stochastic discrete-time dynamic linear model (DLM), the “discrete-time ” variable k being associated with the kth received pulse. The time-varying parameters of the DLM depend on the sequence of active sources. The deinterleaving detection/estimation task can then be done optimally via linear signal processing using the Kalman filter (or recursive least squares when the source periods are constant) and tree searching. The optimal solution, however, is computationally infeasible for other than small data lengths since the number of possible sequences grow exponentially with data length. Here we propose and study two of a number of possible suboptimal solutions: 1) Forward dynamic programming with fixed look-ahead rather than total look-ahead as required for the optimal scheme; 2) a probabilistic teacher Kalman filtering for the detection/estimation task. In simulation studies we show that when the number of sources is small, the proposed suboptimal schemes yield near-optimal estimates even in the presence of relatively large jitter noise. Also, issues of robustness and generalizations of the approach to the case of <b>missing</b> <b>pulses,</b> unknown source number, and non-Gaussian jitter noise are addressed...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a new pulse wave measurement method that adjusts for the personal characteristics of the patients including age, sex, and skin thickness. We compared the pulse waves of 20 subjects between existing and our proposed methods. The APP {{at each of the}} five pressure steps and moving distance between the first pressure step and the last pressure step were calculated. In the existing method, the APP of 20 subjects at each of the five pressure steps were similar, as the range of the pressures applied onto each subjects’ wrist was the same. However, in the proposed method the APP of 20 subjects at each of the five pressure step was different because the proposed method measures the pulse wave signal at a hold-down pressure that varies according to individual subject characteristics. The result of the proposed method shows that pulse waves can be measured at pressures between 40 and 240 mmHg. In addition, the step-motor moving distance in the proposed method is longer than that in the existing method, suggesting that the proposed method perceives and measures pulse wave at deeper a level, while the existing method might <b>miss</b> <b>pulse</b> wave information at a deeper level and therefore provide inaccurate depth data. Although the range of hold-down pressures determined using the existing method in our study was also from 40 to 240 mmHg, the majority of existing pulse diagnosis instruments have a smaller range, {{and are more likely to}} provide inaccurate depth data. Therefore, the existing method is not suitable for subjects who have a pulse signal beyond the range of hold-down pressures. Conversely, the proposed method minimizes the overlooked pulse wave signal by varying the hold-down pressure from person to person.|$|R

Note that with pulse modulation, the carrier is simply switched on and off {{in sync with the}} pulses; the modulating waveform does not actually exist in the transmitted signal and the envelope of the pulse waveform is extracted from the demodulated carrier in the receiver.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{of both the}} interior and exterior pulsar magnetosphere depends upon {{the strength of its}} plasma source near the surface of the star. We review magnetospheric models in the light of a vacuum pair-production source model proposed by Sturrock, and Ruderman and Sutherland.

The observed distribution of pulsar spin periods and period derivatives, and the distribution of pulsars with <b>missing</b> radio <b>pulses,</b> is quantitatively consistent with the pair production threshold, when its variation of neutron star radius and moment of inertia with mass is taken into account. All neutron stars observed as pulsars can have relativistic magnetohydrodynamic wind exterior magnetospheres.

40|$|The {{quantification}} of volatile {{emissions from}} volcanoes {{is an integral}} part of understanding magmatic systems, with the exsolution and extent of volcanic degassing having a large impact on the nature of an eruption. Measurements of volatiles have traditionally focused on gas emissions into the atmosphere, but volatiles can also become dissolved in proximal water bodies en route to the surface. Thus the monitoring of rivers draining active volcanic areas can provide insights to identifying changes in activity. This process is particularly important for sub-glacial volcanoes in Iceland, where much of the volatile release is transported within glacial outbreak floods, termed jökulhlaups. Monitoring and characterising these phenomena is hampered by the dependence on spot sampling of stochastic events under challenging field conditions, which often leads to bias in the collected data. A recent technological advance is the osmotic sampler, an electricity-free pump that continuously collects water that can subsequently be divided into time-averaged samples. This technique allows for continued and unsupervised deployment of a sampler for weeks to months, representing a cost-efficient form of chemical monitoring. In this study we deployed osmotic samplers in two rivers in southern Iceland. Skálm is a proglacial river from Mýrdalsjökull glacier and Katla volcano, while Skaftá is a larger drainage system from the western part of Vatnajökull glacier. Both rivers are prone to jökulhlaups from geothermal and volcanic sources, and a small jökulhlaup of geothermal origin occurred during the second deployment in Skaftá in January 2014. The two deployments show that osmotic samplers are capable of delivering accurate chemical data in turbulent conditions for several key elements. Total dissolved fluxes for the deployment at Skaftá are calculated to be Na = 9. 9 tonnes/day, Mg = 10. 5 t/d, Si = 34. 7 t/d, Cl = 11. 0 t/d, Ca = 31. 6 t/d, DIC = 50. 8 t/d, and SO 4 = 28. 3 t/d, with significant elevations of element concentrations during the jökulhlaup. Dissolved fluxes vary considerably on temporal scales from days to seasons, so that spot sampling may <b>miss</b> <b>pulses</b> in concentrations. This is particularly important for elements such as Mn. The continuous geochemical records from the osmotic samplers make it possible to identify pulses of fluxes attributed to sea spray, groundwater, and subglacial sources. The samplers can also be combined with existing methods of river monitoring, such as conductivity and discharge, to accurately assess changes to fluvial chemistry due to volcanic inputs. Moreover, there is the potential to deploy osmotic samplers in a range of other affected water bodies (e. g. wells, springs, lakes) to gain further insights into volcanic processes...|$|R
