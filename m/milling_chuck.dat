50|$|On the 25th {{anniversary of}} the station (November 1, 1995) the station was again sold to <b>Chuck</b> <b>Mills,</b> an {{investor}} from Wisconsin. He {{held on to the}} station for 6 months before an offer was presented to him which he could not turn down. The station was again sold in the summer of 1996 to Mike Weckerly. Shortly after Mike Weckerly purchased WFPS, he moved the station out of the trailer it had been broadcasting from for 26 years into a real building that also housed WFRL on Tower Road. It was in August 1996 when WFPS got its first taste of digital automation using Scott Studios.|$|R
50|$|John Porter {{remained}} {{active at}} Kabeyun as Director Emeritus {{until his death}} in 1978. He was succeeded as director by William Old, then a teacher at the Potomac School and later Headmaster of The Hill School and Powhatan School. Nick Latham, a former camper and sailing counselor, left a career as an engineer to serve as director from 1973 to 1995. More than 250 former campers and staff attended a memorial service for Latham held at camp in the summer of 2007, following his death from Parkinson's disease. <b>Chuck</b> <b>Mills,</b> a former high school English teacher, served as director from 1996 to 2010. The present director is Ken Robbins, an outdoor educator.|$|R
50|$|DeBatt's {{physical}} stature, {{endurance and}} strength {{earned him the}} reputation as an excellent athlete. During high school, he was a varsity football player who showed tremendous skill on the field in high school. Unlike many of his criminal associates he successfully {{graduated from high school}} and had been awarded an athletic scholarship to Wake Forest University in North Carolina to play for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team. The Wake Forest Demon Deacons is a NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision {{as a member of the}} Atlantic Coast Conference. While at the university he was trained and coached by <b>Chuck</b> <b>Mills.</b> It seemed that DeBatt would pursue a career as a professional athlete and not become involved in organized crime like his father.|$|R
50|$|Adams played college {{football}} for Utah State from 1970 through 1972 prior {{to becoming a}} professional athlete. During his time with the Utah State Aggies, Adams was the starting quarterback. The Aggies' 3-year record during Adams' tenure totaled up to 21 wins, 11 losses, and 1 tie. He didn't miss any games, playing in all 33 contests while he attended Utah State. On November 11, 1972, Adams set an NCAA record with 561 net passing yards and five touchdowns in an 44-16 Aggie win over the University of Utah Utes. The teams combined for an NCAA record 950 passing yards, and Adams 561 net passing yard stood for many years as an NCAA Division 1 record. The head coach that worked with Adams for all 3 seasons was <b>Chuck</b> <b>Mills.</b> His number 11 jersey was retired by Utah State in 1972.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chuck</b> <b>Mills</b> {{was hired}} away from Utah State {{and served as}} the Demon Deacons head {{football}} coach for five seasons, compiling an 11 - 43 - 1 record before he was fired due to the team's continued lackluster on-the-field performance. In 1973, Mills' first season, the Demon Deacons compiled a 1-9-1 record and finished in last place in the Atlantic Coast Conference. This {{was followed by a}} 1-10 record and last place finish in the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1974. Mills' third season in 1975 saw the Demon Deacons go 3-8 record and finish in fourth place in the Atlantic Coast Conference. In 1976, the Demon Deacons compiled a 5-6 record and finished in third place in the Atlantic Coast Conference. In their fifth and final season under Mills in 1977, the Demon Deacons compiled a 5-6 record and finished in last place in the Atlantic Coast Conference.|$|R
50|$|Since World War I Hamilton County {{has been}} the most {{consistently}} Republican of New York State. Since Woodrow Wilson carried the county in 1916, the Republican candidate has lost only once, when Barry Goldwater in 1964 failed to win a single county in the state. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, John McCain carried Hamilton County by a 26.9% margin over Barack Obama, with Obama winning statewide by a virtually equal margin over McCain, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won the county over President Obama in the 2012 election, too. Hamilton gave McCain the highest margin of victory in the state. It was the only county won by Howard <b>Mills</b> over incumbent <b>Chuck</b> Schumer in the 2004 U.S. Senate election. It also voted for John Faso over Eliot Spitzer for governor in 2006, and for John Spencer 55.5%-42.1% over incumbent Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate in 2006. It was {{one of only a handful}} of counties outside Western New York to have voted for Carl Paladino over eventual winner Andrew Cuomo for Governor in 2010.|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC <b>milling</b> machines. The <b>chuck</b> holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet chuck holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of collet chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|R
