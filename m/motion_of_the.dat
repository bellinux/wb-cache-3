5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirror would result in twice the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E

Specifying {{a position in}} ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to {{the direction of the}} equinox at that date. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and ecliptic of date. This specifies the mean equinox of 4 Jan 2010 0h TT as above, without the addition of nutation.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
