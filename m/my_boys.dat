He had expressed himself grieved at being thus obliged to retreat, and nobly observed, 'What will Nelson think of us?' His clerk was killed by his side; and by another shot, several marines, while hauling on the main-brace, shared the same fate. Riou then exclaimed, 'Come, then, <b>my</b> <b>boys,</b> let us all die together!' The words were scarcely uttered, when the fatal shot severed him in two.|$|E
500|$|Dylan began 1973 {{by signing}} {{with a new}} label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his {{contract}} with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of [...] "Forever Young", which became {{one of his most}} popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected [...] "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan", and Dylan himself commented: [...] "I wrote it thinking about one of <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> and not wanting to be too sentimental." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 8, 1905, Bradley heard gunshots {{close to}} his {{waterfront}} home in Flamingo. [...] He set sail in his small skiff, and encountered a father and his two sons {{by the name of}} Smith, who were shooting up a rookery. The families had known each other for years, but Civil War veteran Walter Smith had a reputation for being troublesome, and Bradley had previously had altercations with him. [...] He had arrested Smith on one occasion and Smith's oldest son, Tom, twice for poaching. [...] Smith threatened to retaliate against Bradley if he tried again, reportedly telling the warden, [...] "You ever arrest one of <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> again, I'll kill you." ...|$|E
500|$|Eliza, a {{homemaker}} and a devout Baptist, struggled {{to maintain a}} semblance of stability at home, as Bill was frequently gone for extended periods. She also put up with his philandering and his double life, which included bigamy. Thrifty by nature and necessity, she taught her son that [...] "willful waste makes woeful want". John did {{his share of the}} regular household chores and earned extra money raising turkeys, selling potatoes and candy, and eventually lending small sums of money to neighbors. He followed his father's advice to [...] "trade dishes for platters" [...] and always get the better part of any deal. Bill once bragged, [...] "I cheat <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> every chance I get. I want to make 'em sharp." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> just burst out laughing. Even I found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E

500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> and girls to do what I had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|O'Gara {{used his}} inaugural {{column for the}} Irish Examiner to comment on his {{decision}} to retire: [...] "I have ambitions {{in the years ahead}} to coach at a high level and, with this in mind, I can confirm now that I will be joining Racing Métro's coaching staff in July. I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. <b>My</b> <b>boys</b> in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|Tryon was {{alerted to}} the {{presence}} of the Americans in Bethel around 1 am on April 27, cutting short thoughts of remaining for another day in Danbury. [...] Rousing the troops, he ordered the houses of Patriots to be burned; in all, more than twenty structures were destroyed. [...] The troops then left Danbury around dawn, and marched south toward the village of Ridgefield in an attempt to avoid General Wooster's force. [...] Hoping to delay General Tryon until overwhelming reinforcements arrived, General Wooster split his force. The main body, about 400 men, went with Generals Arnold and Silliman across the countryside to Ridgefield, where they were met by another 100 militiamen, and erected crude barricades on the road through town. [...] General Wooster personally chased after the British column with the remaining 200; [...] his effort was assisted by local Patriots who created impediments before the British column, including the destruction of at least one bridge. [...] Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Wooster engaged Tryon's rear guard as it paused for breakfast about [...] north of the town of Ridgefield, killing at least two British soldiers.Wooster took about forty prisoners in this first engagement, and then retreated for cover in nearby woods. [...] He struck again an hour later, but the British were more prepared for a second engagement, having positioned three artillery pieces with their rear guard, spraying the colonials with grape shot. Rallying his men, the 67-year-old General Wooster was mortally wounded moments after yelling [...] "Come on <b>my</b> <b>boys!</b> Never mind such random shots!" [...] about [...] from Ridgefield's town center; his inexperienced militia dissolved in confusion. [...] Wooster died five days later in Danbury at the home of Nehemiah Dibble, whose house had also served as General Tryon's temporary quarters in Danbury. [...] Wooster's last words were reported to be [...] "I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence." [...] Wooster's harassment of the British column had provided enough time for Arnold and Silliman to prepare a crude defensive position at Ridgefield.|$|E

2500|$|Children {{who could}} not adjust at Carlisle {{eventually}} returned to their families and homes. Some ran away because of being homesick and unhappy. Several years after a student ran away, the young man approached Pratt {{in the lobby of}} a New York hotel. He explained that he had found himself a good job, was working hard and saved some money. [...] "Hurrah!" [...] the Captain exclaimed. [...] "I wish all <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> would run away!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{claiming}} [...] "we all {{helped put}} the album together", Q-Tip {{was the only}} Tribe Called Quest member present at every recording session. Group member Phife Dawg later admitted [...] "I was being ignorant on that first album, that’s why I was only {{on a couple of}} tracks. I was hardly around. I would have rather hung out with <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> on the street and got my hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn’t even on the contract for the first album. I was thinking me and Jarobi were more like back-ups for Tip and Ali, but Tip and Ali really wanted me to come through and do my thing".|$|E

2500|$|In August 1853 Jesse's son Ulysses was {{assigned}} to duty {{on the west coast}} at Fort Humboldt, but ran into difficulty with his commanding officer at the remote fort when rumors began to circulate about Ulysses' alleged excessive drinking. After being given the choice to resign or face court-marshal Ulysses resigned and returned home to his wife and children much to the disappointed of his father, who upon his arrival expressed his feelings with the comment, [...] "West Point spoiled one of <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> for business", where Ulysses replied [...] "I guess that's about so". Jesse made attempts to avert his son's resignation and wrote to Jefferson Davis of the War Department, but his appeal for his son's reinstatement was turned down.|$|E
2500|$|Benedikt Fontana is {{considered}} a hero and a freedom fighter in the Grisons. Legend has it that he cheered on his men to attack the Habsburg fortifications with the words [...] "Hei fraischgiamank meiss matts, cun mai ais be ün hom da fear, quai brichia guardad, u chia hoatz Grischuns e Ligias u maa non plü!""Go on, <b>my</b> <b>boys,</b> I'm just one man, do not care about me. Today is for the Grisons and the Leagues, or never!". Whether he really used such words is of course uncertain; written accounts that emphasise {{his role in the}} battle appeared only {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. The legend was further elaborated and became popular in the 19th century, and in 1903, a statue was erected in his honor at Chur.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, he was looked after by his monastic disciples and Sarada Devi. Ramakrishna was advised by the doctors {{to keep the}} strictest silence, but {{ignoring}} their advice, he incessantly conversed with visitors. According to traditional accounts, before his death, Ramakrishna transferred his spiritual powers to Vivekananda and reassured Vivekananda of his avataric status. Ramakrishna asked Vivekananda {{to look after the}} welfare of the disciples, saying, [...] "keep <b>my</b> <b>boys</b> together" [...] and asked him to [...] "teach them". Ramakrishna also asked other monastic disciples to look upon Vivekananda as their leader. Ramakrishna's condition gradually worsened, and he died {{in the early morning hours}} of 16 August 1886 at the Cossipore garden house. According to his disciples, this was mahasamadhi. After the death of their master, the monastic disciples led by Vivekananda formed a fellowship at a half-ruined house at Baranagar near the river Ganges, with the financial assistance of the householder disciples. This became the first Math or monastery of the disciples who constituted the first Ramakrishna Order.|$|E
