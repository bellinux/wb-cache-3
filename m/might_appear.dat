5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|Lions are chiefly {{associated}} with Ishtar {{or with the}} male gods Shamash or Ningirsu. In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws. H.Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that {{is due to the}} fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> inappropriately threatening if their mouths were open.|$|E

5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> {{on the floor of}} the other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|Yamatos {{crew were}} at general {{quarters}} {{and ready for}} anti-aircraft action by dawn on 7 April. The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two flying boats arrived soon thereafter, {{and for the next}} five hours, Yamato fired Common Type 3 or Beehive (3 Shiki tsûjôdan) shells at the Allied seaplanes, but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. Yamato obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that <b>might</b> <b>appear.</b> None did.|$|E

5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of the}} distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E
5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, {{it will remain}} clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through the}} level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E

Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Martín Vázquez, when referred to by his surnames Martín Vázquez mistakenly appears to be forenamed Martín rather than Rafael, whilst, to his annoyance, the linguist Fernando Lázaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as Don Lázaro, rather than as Don Fernando (Lázaro can be either forename or surname).|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the Alley & McLellan shipyard in Polmadie, Lanarkshire, <b>might</b> <b>appear</b> perverse, as the yard was a considerable distance from the River Clyde, with the expansive final approach into Glasgow Central Station posing {{just one of many}} barriers between it and the Clyde.
