25|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and experiment have both shown that periodically arrayed conducting elements (non-magnetic by nature) respond predominantly to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>component</b> of incident electromagnetic fields. The {{result is an}} effective medium and negative μeff over a band of frequencies. The permeability was verified to be {{the region of the}} forbidden band, where the gap in propagation occurred – from a finite section of material. This was combined with a negative permittivity material, εeff < 0, to form a “left-handed” medium, which formed a propagation band with negative group velocity where previously there was only attenuation. This validated predictions. In addition, a later work determined that this first metamaterial had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation (see ref #). Other predicted electrodynamic effects were to be investigated in other research.|$|E

High {{frequency}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> have {{financial and}} physical advantages compared to low frequency <b>magnetic</b> <b>components.</b> Although high frequency <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> {{have been used}} for quite some time, the design and analysis of these components remain complicated. This can be ascribed to the effect of eddy currents and thermal constraints due to the smaller cooling area of such <b>components.</b> Planar <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> have long been preferred due to the higher manufacturing output, better quality control and the favorable flat shape of the component. Many studies have been conducted on planar <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> with respect to the energy storage capacity, air gap shape and placement, low permeability materials, to replace the air gaps, the placing of the conductors in the winding window, etc. The designs that are commonly used for planar <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> today, {{are the ones that are}} proven to work and not necessarily the ones that are optimal. In this study a thermal model is presented to ease the design of DC inductors. A lot of emphasis is placed on heat extraction resulting from losses in the embedded conductors through the core. This is an unconventional way to extract heat from the planar structure and leads to a new approach towards design planar inductor design...|$|R

2500|$|The {{metamaterial}} {{was constructed}} as a periodic array of [...] copper split ring and wire conducting elements deposited onto a circuit-board substrate. The design {{was such that}} the cells, and the lattice spacing between the cells, were {{much smaller than the}} radiated electromagnetic wavelength. Hence, it behaves as an effective medium. The material has become notable because its range of (effective) permittivity εeff and permeability μeff values have exceeded those found in any ordinary material. Furthermore, the characteristic of negative (effective) permeability evinced by this medium is particularly notable, because it has not been found in ordinary materials. In addition, the negative values for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>component</b> is directly related to its left-handed nomenclature, and properties (discussed in a section below). The split-ring resonator (SRR), based on the prior 1999 theoretical article, is the tool employed to achieve negative permeability. This first composite metamaterial is then composed of split-ring resonators and electrical conducting posts.|$|E

Pathfinder carried a series of magnets to examine the <b>magnetic</b> <b>component</b> of the dust. Eventually, {{all but one of the}} magnets developed a coating of dust. [...] Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure magnetite or just one type of maghemite. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Using much more sophisticated instruments, Mars Spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars.

The data used in this paper cover the period from 1 August 2009 to 11 October 2009. The anomalous variations in <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> (Bx, By and Bz) were clearly observed on 1 and 3 days before the event.

40|$|Recently, with an enlighting treatment, Baskaran and Grishchuk {{have shown}} the {{presence}} and importance of the so-called ``magnetic'' components of gravitational waves (GWs), which {{have to be taken}} into account in the context of the total response functions of interferometers for GWs propagating from arbitrary directions. In this paper the analysis of the response functions for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> is generalized in its full frequency dependence, while in the work of Baskaran and Grishchuk the response functions were computed only in the approximation of wavelength much larger than the linear dimensions of the interferometer. It is also shown that the response functions to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> grow at high frequencies, differently from the values of the response functions to the well known ordinary components that decrease at high frequencies. Thus the <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> could in principle become the dominant part of the signal at high frequencies. This is important for a potential detection of the signal at high frequencies and confirms that the magnetic contributions must be taken into account in the data analysis. More, the fact that the response functions of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>components</b> grow at high frequencies shows that, in principle, the frequency-range of Earth-based interferometers could extend to frequencies over 10000 Hz.
