By numerical simulation analysis on the flow field in the <b>melt</b> <b>pump,</b> distribution characteristics of pressure, flow velocity vectors and shear rate in the <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> were obtained. Finally, the effects of inflow rate on the pressure difference between the exit and {{the entrance of the}} <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> were investigated by analyzing the pressure field of the <b>melt</b> <b>pump,</b> which could be used to guide the design of <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> and the plastics molding process...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 27 A major {{chemical}} company has implemented a cost reduction and performance enhancement via universal joints on a <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> application. The <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> {{is used to}} push molten polyethylene through a die to produce pellets. The pump takes material at 30 psig and 200 C (390 F) and discharges at 3000 psig. Misalignment between the gearbox and <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> gear centers is approximately one degree. The authors jointly studied the existing {{problems associated with the}} gear spindles (high angle gear coupling) : primarily reduced life, high maintenance, and high repair costs {{due in large part to}} high operating temperatures and the seal design of gear spindle at high misalignment, and proposed block style universal joints to solve the problems. The universal joints replaced the gear spindles supplied originally by the pump manufacturer. This paper demonstrates the block style universal joints were able to: ?	Significantly reduce plant downtime. ?	Eliminate high repair costs associated with gear spindles, for the chemical company. ?	Reduce wear and tear on the <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> compared to gear spindles. ?	Improve yield (or production) through superior performance and reliability. ?	Reduce noise levels. These block type universal joints have been running for over five years now and have been inspected once after 24 months of operation with only general wear and tear from normal operation. The paper will also demonstrates how the universal joints will continue to improve performance in the long term...|$|E

In {{view of the}} {{complexity}} of twin screw and <b>melt</b> <b>pump</b> tandem extrusion systems, the identification of the dynamic characteristics of these systems was performed by using MATLAB and state subspace method. Three input one output model was obtained and the controllability and observability of the system was identified by MATLAB. The fitting degree of simulated and actual melt pressure curve increased with increasing the output variables, which indicated that the tandem extrusion system was an interrelated coupled nonlinear system. 1...|$|E
40|$|YesExtrusion-a unit {{operation}} in polymer processing {{has been in}} extensive use since the great age of plastic technology. It is a simple operation that enables within one equipment the sequential conveying of solid polymer chips or powder, their <b>melting,</b> mixing, <b>pumping</b> and shaping via a die {{into a variety of}} high tonnage and/or value products. Pipes, bottles, films are the most common examples but the list of applications is endless from tiny micromoulded parts to large structural profiles. Extrusion is not limited to plastics but is used hot or cold to process soft solids like food, industrial and pharmaceutical pastes, as well as metals and ceramics. Most of the advances in extrusion processing have concentrated in improving the essential functions of extrusion: solid conveying, <b>melting,</b> <b>pumping</b> and mixing. The literature abounds with descriptions of such advances pushing the limits of the extrusion in an incremental way. In this paper, we describe step-changes in enhancing extrusion, which opens up new applications to better old technology-make them safer, cheaper and cleaner. The new designs presented in this paper have also the potential to develop new reactor technology for viscous fluids...|$|R
40|$|Upon heating, many of {{the middle-aged}} {{bituminous}} coals exhibit a plasticity very similar to polyethylene for a few minutes. Plastic coal can be extruded, pelletized or molded using common plastics technology and equipment. Investigations concerning the plastic state of coals are conducted with the objective to develop techniques which will make useful commercial applications of this property possible. Experiments which show the characteristics of plastic-state coal are discussed, and problems related to a continuous extrusion of coal are considered. Probably the most {{significant difference between the}} continuous extrusion of coal and the extrusion of a thermoplastic polymer is that volatiles are continuously being released from the coal. Attention is given to aspects of dragflow, solids feeding, and <b>melt</b> <b>pumping.</b> Application potentials for plastic coal extrusion might be related to coal gasification, direct liquefaction, and coal combustion...|$|R
50|$|It was {{suspected}} that a turbopump bearing failure caused the anomalous conditions during orbital injection, followed by heating and <b>melting</b> of <b>pump</b> components. The inability of ground controllers {{to start the}} engine during the 63rd orbit was possibly due to melted or loose debris blocking the fuel valve and preventing its operation. The telemetry data falsely reporting erratic pump speed was concluded to be debris being knocked around and affecting the data probes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} define new metallogenic guides for Li, Nb and Ta supply, three Variscan LCT {{pegmatite}} fields are investigated. A multidisciplinary approach is favoured to discuss both the genetic and emplacement models for LCT-type deposits. The spatial statistical analyses demonstrate the high clustering rate of Li-rich pegmatites and the spatial relationships between Li-pegmatites location and surrounding damage fractured zone. The Li-isotopes analyses on micas suggest {{the absence of}} genetic continuum between surrounding granites and pegmatites since δ 7 Li values (‰) are similar through pegmatite field and inside granite samples. To refine these previous results, preliminary numerical models are developed to constrain the ascent of these low viscosity pegmatite-forming melts and determine key criterion of their uncoupling from parental magma source. According to these results, the high permeability seems to {{play a crucial role}} in the pegmatite melts collection and during their ascent. The combination of geostatistical, geochemical and numerical tools allows suggesting an alternative model of direct crustal anatexis to the common parental granite model. These high permeability damage shear zones are considered to favour the low volume of pegmatite-forming <b>melt</b> <b>pumping</b> and their escape from their deeper crustal magma source...|$|R

Hence, heat transfer to an Ellis model fluid in the entrance region of two parallel plates both under constant wall temperature and constant heat flux conditions has been considered in the present analysis. Flow through a circular pipe has already been considered [2]...|$|R

The plastic is <b>melted</b> and then <b>pumped</b> into a furnace. The heat of the furnace breaks down the molecular chains of polyethylene into wax. Finally, the wax is subjected to a catalytic process that alters the wax's molecular structure, leaving a clear oil.|$|R
40|$|The cryo-hydro {{integrated}} robotic penetrator system (CHIRPS) is {{a partially}} developed instrumentation system {{that includes a}} probe designed to deeply penetrate the European ice sheet {{in a search for}} signs of life. The CHIRPS could also be used on Earth for similar exploration of the polar ice caps especially at Lake Vostok in Antarctica. The CHIRPS probe advances downward by a combination of simple melting of ice (typically for upper, non-compacted layers of an ice sheet) or by a combination of melting of ice and pumping of meltwater (typically, for deeper, compacted layers). The heat and electric power for <b>melting,</b> <b>pumping,</b> and operating all of the onboard instrumentation and electronic circuitry are supplied by radioisotope power sources (RPSs) and thermoelectric converters energized by the RPSs. The instrumentation and electronic circuitry includes miniature guidance and control sensors and an advanced autonomous control system that has fault-management capabilities. The CHIRPS probe is about 1 m long and 15 cm in diameter. The RPSs generate a total thermal power of 1. 8 kW. Initially, as this power melts the surrounding ice, a meltwater jacket about 1 mm thick forms around the probe. The center of gravity of the probe is well forward (down), so that the probe is vertically stabilized like a pendulum. Heat is circulated to the nose by means of miniature pumps and heat pipes. The probe melts ice to advance in a step-wise manner: Heat is applied to the nose to open up a melt void, then heat is applied to the side to allow the probe to slip down into the melt void. The melt void behind the probe is allowed to re-freeze. Four quadrant heaters on the nose and another four quadrant heaters on the rear (upper) surface of the probe are individually controllable for steering: Turning on two adjacent nose heaters on the nose and two adjacent heaters on the opposite side at the rear causes melt voids to form on opposing sides, such that the probe descends at an angle from vertical. This steering capability can be used to avoid debris trapped in the ice or to maneuver closer to a trapped object of scientific interest...|$|R

50|$|As the American Sulphur Company was abandoning its efforts, Frasch, {{with the}} backing of Frank Rockefeller, Feargus B. Squire and Louis Severance, was on an {{adjacent}} property beginning his own efforts. Frasch had learned about the well-publicized sulfur mining failures, and purchased land adjacent to the American Sulphur Company's land. He assumed that the sulfur deposits extended laterally underneath his property, and he planned to extract the sulfur with a new method. He would pump super-heated water down a pipe into the sulfur to <b>melt</b> it, and <b>pump</b> compressed air down a second pipe to force the molten sulfur up through a third pipe. Upon drilling on his property, however, Frasch discovered that the sulfur was only located beneath the American Sulphur Company property.|$|R
40|$|Plasticating {{single-screw}} extrusion {{involves the}} continuous conversion of loose solid pellets into a pressurized homogeneous <b>melt</b> that is <b>pumped</b> through a shaping tool. Traditional {{analyses of the}} solids conveying stage assume the movement of an elastic solid plug at a fixed speed. However, not only the corresponding predictions fail considerably, {{but it is also}} well known that, at least in the initial screw turns, the flow of loose individual pellets takes place. This study follows previous efforts to predict the characteristics of such a flow using the discrete element method. The model considers the development of normal and tangential forces resulting from the inelastic collisions between the pellets and between them and the neighbouring metallic surfaces. The algorithm proposed here is shown to be capable of capturing detailed features of the granular flow. The predictions of velocities in the cross- and down-channel directions and of the coordination number are in good agreement with equivalent reported results. The effect of pellet size on the flow features is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|If {{the other}} {{renewable}} alternatives are too warm {{during the summer}} or too expensive, cold storage can be investigated. In large scale applications underground and snow storage {{are the most likely}} alternatives. In an underground storage the winter cold is heat exchanged from the air and loaded into the bedrock or an aquifer by one or more bore holes. In a snow storage frozen water (snow and/or ice) is saved in some kind of storage (pile, pit, cavern etc.). The cold is utilized by <b>pumping</b> <b>melt</b> water to the cooling object, directly in a district cooling system or indirect by a heat exchanger. The lukewarm melt water is then pumped back to the snow where it gets cooled and mixed with new melt water. Snow cooling works as a single cold source but can also be used for peak cooling since there is no relevant cooling limit. In Sweden there is one snow cooling plant in Sundsvall, built and owned by the county. The cooling load in Sundsvall is about 2000 kW (570 tons of refrigeration) and 1500 MWh/year.|$|R
40|$|To {{design an}} {{extruder}} screw {{for a given}} polymer, the barrel length for melting is needed for a given flow rate and speed. The melting rate needed for calculating the length is given through the conservation laws in cylindrical coordinates based on defined fundamental average parameters. Extrusion machine data are {{used to calculate the}} functions of the parameters. Results based on polyethylene data are given. Background Detailed distributed analytical models [1, 2] have been developed for melting with elaborate experimental freezeout data for verification. A laboratory technique for measuring melting under compacting stress was introduced [3], and it was further developed [4] and modeled [5]. Many versions of a distributed model for melting are available [6], each with its own set of assumptions and technique. Conversely, the model developed here uses the performance data of operating extruders to comprehensively establish average general terms of the energy equation that control the melting process. Model Domain of Melting: The extruder is divided into three domains (volumes), which are the feed, <b>melting,</b> and <b>pumping</b> domains. The lengths of the extruder that pertain to each domain are defined portions. Portions are determined by thermodynamics and not by geometrical changes (as typically are sections of the screw). Figure 1 shows the melting portion of the extruder to begin at axial position Lf, where the first melting of the polymer occurs (usually on the barrel). The end of the melting portion is reached at axial position Lm, where the average enthalpy (and temperature) of the polymer are those of the fully melted polymer. Mass Balance: Solid and melt flow will exist at any point, but the net flow in the axial direction is constant at any cross section (see Figure 2). Therefore, tanm v rdrd cons taR R...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{steady-state}} fluid-mechanical analysis describing {{the effect of}} strain partitioning on viscous energy dissipation. As observed in experimental studies of shear deformation of partially molten rocks, strain partitions when melt segregates because viscosity is reduced in regions of elevated melt fraction. The equations derived here are based on parameters measured in experiments, describing the evolution of melt distribution and rheological properties. We find that the dissipation depends strongly on {{the configuration of the}} melt-rich network of shear zones, including the average angle, volume fraction of melt and amplification of strain rate in the melt-rich bands. Minima in energy dissipation as a function of band angle develop, corresponding to configurations of melt networks that minimize the difference in mean stress between the band and the non-band regions. We propose that the organization of band networks occurs by the interplay between strain localization and viscosity variations asso-ciated with melt segregation. The band networks maintain a steady-state angle during shear by continuously <b>pumping</b> <b>melt</b> through the network. The development of strain partitioning in melt-rich net-works will modify the energetics of melting and melt transport by efficiently extracting melt and reducing effective viscosity.

40|$|Structures and {{alteration}} {{associated with}} mineralizing, pre-anatectic hydrothermal alteration at the Challenger gold mine in South Australia strongly influenced and preferentially focused subsequent metamorphism, partial melting and deformation. This event resulted in efficient deformation-enhanced melt extraction from the host rocks immediately adjacent to mineralization, leaving restitic garnet, cordierite, K-feldspar rich mineral assemblages. Progressive reintegration of silicate melt into the highly restitic proximal gneiss bulk composition, using mineral equilibrium modelling {{in the system}} NCKFMASHTO, indicates that hydrothermal alteration stabilized {{a higher proportion of}} hydrous minerals leading to increased fertility and thus melting in the proximal gneiss. Further modelling at lower temperatures provides an insight into mineral assemblages that may have been associated with mineralization. Temperature–composition modelling provides evidence that composite gold–sulphide melts were armoured by quartz and as such were immobile during peak metamorphism. At Challenger, melt permeability of the mineralized zones was enhanced via the formation of a structural fabric, folding, boudinage, fracturing and the formation of shear zones. Giving consideration to the relationships and orientations of these structures, a model for preferential deformation and melt migration within the mineralized shear zone under transpression is developed, where <b>melt</b> is essentially <b>pumped</b> out of the system parallel to the maximum principal elongation direction.

40|$|A lipase from Aspergillus niger, immobilized by {{physical}} adsorption on hydrophobic hollow fibers made of microporous polypropylene, {{was used to}} effect the hydrolysis of the glycerides of melted butterfat at 40, 50, 55, and 60 °C (pH 7. 0), and at pH 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 7. 0, 8. 0, and 9. 0 (40 °C). McIlvane buffer and <b>melted</b> butterfat were <b>pumped</b> cocurrently through the hollow fiber reactor. The concentrations of ten different free fatty acids in the effluent oil stream were measured by HPLC. Multiresponse nonlinear regression methods were employed to fit the data to multisubstrate rate expressions derived from a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism in which the rate controlling step is deacylation of the enzyme. Thermal deactivation of the immobilized lipase was {{also included in the}} mathematical model of reactor performance. A postulated normal distribution of vmax with respect to the number of carbon atoms of the fatty acid residue (with an additive correction for the number of double bonds) was found to provide the best statistical fit of the data.
