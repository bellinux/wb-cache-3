2500|$|June: Speaking to al Jazeera, Taliban leader Mullah Bakht Mohammed {{stated that}} [...] "Sheikh Osama bin Laden {{is alive and}} active. He's {{carrying}} out his duties. The latest proof that he is alive is that he sent me a letter of condolences after the martyrdom of my brother. He advised <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> my brother's path." [...] Mohammed's brother Dadullah had led military operations for the Taliban {{until his death in}} May 2007. Mohammed stated that [...] "Sheikh Osama prefers not to be seen or meet anyone because if he makes himself available to the media maybe he will be facing danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E

6000|$|The marine smiled. [...] "I {{never went}} back to the Apache," [...] he said. [...] "When I arrived at Madras I found that she had sailed from Calcutta.

6000|$|... "It's {{of no use}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> him," [...] {{thought the}} hunter. [...] "It is too dry for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> track him. He {{may not be so}} badly scared, after all. I'll just find a good place and wait." ...|$|R
60|$|Motioning to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> him, he ran swiftly {{down the}} stairs and opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said; [...] "it is true. And {{the same}} dark wave that lifted you, swept <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> With that revolver--and blubbering with hate. And {{the word to}} you, Nettie, what was it? 'Give?' Hurl {{yourself}} down the steep?" ...|$|R
