40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the {{response}} of <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems</b> to time dependent fields and the current fluctuations in <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems</b> with a superconducting region. Using the non equilibrium Greens function formalism we derive general expressions for the photo current and the ac current in terms of double energy Greens functions. The effects of phase-breaking and charging can be included. The formalism is used to study the effect of charging on the ac conductance of double barrier resonant tunneling structures. Charging is found to {{play a significant role}} in determining the ac conductance. Simple examples are used to illustrate the effect of phonon scattering on the ac response of resonant tunneling structures. We then study the current fluctuations in <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems</b> with a superconducting region using the Landauer-Buttiker approach to transport. Expressions for current fluctuations analogous to those in purely normal <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems</b> are derived. These expressions are applied to some simple examples. ...|$|R

5000|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution to}} the Poisson-Boltzmann equation {{can be used to}} describe an electron-electron interaction in a metal-insulator semiconductor (MIS). [...] This can be used to describe both time and position dependence of dissipative systems such as a <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system.</b> This is done by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation analytically in the three-dimensional case. Solving this results in expressions of the distribution function for the Boltzmann equation and self-consistent average potential for the Poisson equation. These expressions are useful for analyzing quantum transport in a <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system.</b> In metal-insulator semiconductor tunneling junctions, the electrons can build up close to the interface between layers and as a result the quantum transport of the system will be affected by the electron-electron interactions. Certain transport properties such as electric current and electronic density can be known by solving for self-consistent Coulombic average potential from the electron-electron interactions, which is related to electronic distribution. Therefore, it is essential to analytically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in order to obtain the analytical quantities in the MIS tunneling junctions.Applying the following analytical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (see section 2) to MIS tunneling junctions, the following expression can be formed to express electronic transport quantities such as electronic density and electric current ...|$|E
50|$|While it {{is often}} {{reasonable}} to introduce randomness to a system which would otherwise be considered deterministic (such as by coupling a microscopic system to a fluctuating heat bath, or by perturbing the velocities in a <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> after collisions) splitting methods in general sit most comfortably with the study of systems which have a large natural stochastic element in their dynamics. The contrast to splitting methods is provided by TPS, in which 'shooting' is instead typically employed: for a strictly deterministic system, the new path must be created by making a small change to the initial conditions rather than by branching from a point mid-way into the simulation. If the dynamics of a system are chaotic then shooting moves based on perturbation of the start coordinates should {{have a very high}} rate of failure in generating rare events, however a benefit is that shooting can function equally well (if time-symmetry is present) by making a perturbation to the final conditions of the system (post rare-event) and running the simulation backwards, thereby sampling new paths with the guarantee that they terminate in the rare event. If the assumptions of equilibrium holding only at the initial (or final) conditions are relaxed, then shooting moves can also be made by perturbing the system during a shot.|$|E

40|$|We study charge {{detection}} and controlled dephasing of a <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> via a quantum dot detector (QDD), where the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> and the QDD are capacitively coupled. The QDD {{is considered to}} have coherent resonant tunnelling via a single level. It is found that the dephasing rate {{is proportional to the}} square of the conductance of the QDD for the Breit-Wigner model, showing that the dephasing is completely different from the shot noise of the detector. The measurement rate, on the other hand, shows a dip near the resonance. Our findings are peculiar especially for a symmetric detector in the following aspect: The dephasing rate is maximum at resonance of the QDD where the detector conductance is insensitive to the charge state of the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system.</b> As a result, the efficiency of the detector shows a dip and vanishes at resonance, in contrast to the single-channel symmetric non-resonant detector that has always a maximum efficiency. We find that this difference originates from a very general property of the scattering matrix: The abrupt phase change exists in the scattering amplitudes {{in the presence of the}} symmetry, which is insensitive to the detector current but stores the information of the quantum state of the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{functional}} contexts {{where it is}} desirable to maintain a <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> in a nonequilibrium state.

40|$|We {{point out}} a general {{argument}} leading from the formula for currents through an open <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> given by the theory of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) to the Landauer-Büttiker formula. Landauer-Büttiker type formulas i. e. expressions relating the (charge, energy etc) currents through mesoscopic systems connected with electron reservoirs to the corresponding transmission coefficients have been {{proved to be a}} key tool for analyzing the quantum conductance in nanostructures. Obtained initially for the stationary case by phenomenological arguments [7], [6], [12] they have widely extended and used. As for the derivation, one usually assumes that the reservoirs have a lead geometry and in order {{to make use of the}} asymptotic form of the scattered state the current is evaluated far away from the scatterer [5], [9], [13], a procedure justified (at least in the stationary regime) by charge conservation. However this approach can become problematic for other reservoir geometries when the leads are short or even inexistent (see e. g. [11], [4]) or in non-stationary regime. At a more basic level one starts from a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics formulation (e. g. linear response theory, NESS theory etc) and the problem of proving the Landauer-Büttiker formula is to show that the obtained formula for the current can be cast in a form in which the structure of the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>system</b> enters only via its transition matrix of the associated scattering problem as suggested by the phenomenological derivation. 1 To be more specific let us consider the NESS procedure (see [2] and references therein).

40|$|The Boltzmann {{distribution}} characterizes equilibrium of {{a system}} at thermodynamic limit where inhomogeneity in the bulk is due to some conservative force. In <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems,</b> boundary induced inhomogeneities are often present which a conservative force cannot capture. Moreover, there is controversy (Itô vs Stratonovich) arising from handling of multiplicative noise in the Langevin dynamics of such <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>systems.</b> To make things worse, modification of Fick's law for coordinate dependent diffusion is also considered controversial in existing literature. It is shown here that, the demand of the Boltzmann distribution is untenable for thermodynamic equilibrium {{in the presence of}} coordinate (conformation) dependent damping and diffusion. To alleviate confusion about the form of Fick's law, its exact modification for coordinate dependent diffusivity is derived from first principle and the same is used in the relevant Fokker-Planck dynamics.
