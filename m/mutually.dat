5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{where two}} or more harmful species <b>mutually</b> {{advertise}} themselves as harmful.|$|E
5|$|A.Paul Ince joined Internazionale in August 1995, in a £7.5million transfer. As part of {{the deal}} that took the England midfielder to Inter, both teams <b>mutually</b> agreed to {{participate}} in the Pirelli Cup and a friendly at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} <b>mutually</b> beneficial relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} verses of the Yogatattva Upanishad, the {{simultaneous}} importance of yoga and jnana (knowledge) are asserted, and declared to be <b>mutually</b> complimentary and necessary.|$|E
5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} <b>mutually</b> intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is <b>mutually</b> intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not <b>mutually</b> exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two <b>mutually</b> imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} claim {{sovereignty in}} certain regions. While {{a few of}} these countries have <b>mutually</b> recognised each other's claims, the validity of these claims is not recognised universally.|$|E
5|$|Such exchanges can be <b>mutually</b> beneficial. For instance, 23 to 28 {{percent of}} all {{physicians}} in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada received their training at medical schools outside {{of the country in}} which they currently practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} limited tribal sovereignty by {{affirming the}} ability of Congress to relax or to restrict tribal powers. The opinion of Justice Thomas was especially telling in this, as Thomas had opined that plenary power and tribal sovereignty were <b>mutually</b> exclusive.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary Boarders {{were those}} who {{requested}} that they be admitted for a <b>mutually</b> agreed period of time (from 1915 onwards).|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be <b>mutually</b> exclusive.|$|E
5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a <b>mutually</b> beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} <b>mutually</b> exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|And it {{is further}} <b>mutually</b> agreed that any {{disputes}} arising {{as to the}} interpretation of this Agreement or the facts upon which such interpretation is made, shall be settled by an Arbitration Board of three, one member to be appointed by each of the parties, and the third to be selected by the two appointees. The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final.|$|E
5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently <b>mutually</b> exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is among}} the four most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the other three being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central Atlas Tamazight is mostly spoken in the entire Middle Atlas and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central Atlas in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central Atlas is not <b>mutually</b> intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot understand each other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and Atlas Tamazight, and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not <b>mutually</b> intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not <b>mutually</b> exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a <b>mutually</b> exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Extremophile archaea {{are members}} of four main {{physiological}} groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. These groups are not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they <b>mutually</b> exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes <b>mutually</b> supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form <b>mutually</b> beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed {{to cooperate and}} <b>mutually</b> provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions. The pact neutralized the Habsburg Monarchy {{in regard to the}} Commonwealth's war with Russia, but had resulted in more serious consequences after the Bohemian Revolt gave rise to the Thirty Years' War in 1618.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Đuric {{agreed to}} join Sriwijaya of the Indonesian Super League for a {{reported}} US$110,000 a season contract. However, a month later, he told the press that he declined the offer in the end because Sriwijaya tried to change {{the terms of the}} contract which was <b>mutually</b> agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|In short, Cobb {{does not}} {{conceive}} of dialogue as useful primarily to convert or be converted, {{but rather as}} useful in order to transform both parties <b>mutually,</b> allowing for a broadening of ideas and a reimagining of each faith in order that they might better face {{the challenges of the}} modern world.|$|E
5|$|Kanak {{languages}} are extremely diverse, but French {{serves as the}} official language of New Caledonia. There are 28 distinct Kanak languages, {{as well as many}} dialects, out of the 1,200 Melanesian languages spoken throughout the Pacific. They are <b>mutually</b> incomprehensible. All {{are a part of the}} Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. They all belong to the New Caledonian subgroup – except for Fagauvea, which is a Polynesian language.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being <b>mutually</b> intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not <b>mutually</b> intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. It is {{relatively}} unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with <b>mutually</b> contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, 2011, Zahorchak {{resigned}} as superintendent and was retained as Director of Strategic Initiatives. Cost savings was {{cited by the}} ASD board {{as the reason for}} the resignation. Other issues with Zahorchak's management style, initiatives, and actions were also reported as contributing to the <b>mutually</b> accepted resignation.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no <b>mutually</b> exclusive polarities {{between the}} sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.|$|E
5|$|The three {{variants}} of the Penrose tiling are <b>mutually</b> locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If {{the corners of}} one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by 1,3,5,2,4 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} involves mediation among {{a range of}} self-interested stakeholders engaged {{in the production of}} the built environment. Such mediation can encourage a joint search for <b>mutually</b> beneficial outcomes or integrative development. Integrative development aims to produce sustainable solutions by increasing stakeholder satisfaction with the process and with the resulting urban development.|$|E
5|$|Wagga {{has strong}} {{cultural}} ties with three international sister cities which {{form part of}} a twinning program. Those sister cities are Leavenworth, Kansas in the United States, which was established in 1962; Nördlingen in Germany, established in 1967; and Kunming in China, <b>mutually</b> established in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are <b>mutually</b> recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
