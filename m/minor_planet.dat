5|$|A {{commemorative}} 1-ruble coin {{was released}} in the Soviet Union in 1987 to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino, and four million were minted. A <b>minor</b> <b>planet</b> 3544 Borodino, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977 was named after the village Borodino.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a <b>minor</b> <b>planet,</b> because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object {{had to wait until}} after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead {{that it should}} be considered an inner Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E
50|$|Later on, {{objects were}} found {{orbiting}} near the Lagrangian points of Neptune, Mars, Earth, Uranus, and Venus. <b>Minor</b> <b>planets</b> at the Lagrangian points of planets other than Jupiter {{may be called}} Lagrangian <b>minor</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|R

5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} {{considered part of the}} Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward.

5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating <b>minor</b> <b>planet</b> which transits the star. The disintegration of the planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long fade in the star's optical brightness. The depth of the transit is highly variable.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center catalogue system, is {{an asteroid}} in the asteroid belt. Juno {{was the third}} asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding. It is the 11th-largest asteroid, {{and one of the}} two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the asteroid belt.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{pollution}} of white dwarf (WD) atmospheres arises from the accretion of <b>minor</b> <b>planets,</b> but the exact properties of polluting material, {{and in particular the}} evidence for water in some cases are not yet understood. Previous works studied the water retention in <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> around main-sequence and evolving host stars, in order to evaluate the possibility that water survives inside <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> around WDs. However, all of these studies focused on small, comet-sized to moonlet-sized <b>minor</b> <b>planets,</b> when the inferred mass inside the convection zones of He-dominated WDs could actually also be compatible with much more massive <b>minor</b> <b>planets.</b> In this study we therefore explore for the first time, the water retention inside exo-planetary dwarf planets, or moderate-sized moons, with radii of the order of hundreds of kilometres. We now cover nearly the entire potential mass range of <b>minor</b> <b>planets.</b> The rest of the parameter space considered in this study is identical to that of our previous study, and also includes multiple WD progenitor star masses. We find that water retention in more massive <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> is still affected by the mass of the WD progenitor, however not as much as when small <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> were considered. We also find that water retention is now almost always greater than zero. On average, the detected water fraction in He-dominated WD atmospheres should be at least 5 %, irrespective of the assumed initial water composition, if it came from a single accretion event of an icy dwarf planet or moon. This finding also strengthens the possibility of WD habitability. To finalize our previous and current findings, we provide a code which may be freely used as a service to the community. The code calculates ice and water retention by interpolation, spanning the full mass range of both <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> and their host stars...|$|R

5000|$|Juels {{was born}} in New York City in 1944, {{and grew up in}} Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1969 he {{graduated}} from Cincinnati College of Medicine. After his retirement as a psychiatrist in Phoenix, Arizona, he began hunting for <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> at his private Fountain Hills Observatory, near Fountain Hills, Arizona. He quickly became noted when he was credited with the discovery of 65 numbered <b>minor</b> <b>planets</b> during the first 18 months of his short career as a discoverer of <b>minor</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|R
5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a <b>minor</b> <b>planet</b> goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 global {{industry}} {{survey by}} ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, {{was found to}} be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko, as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans. On June 2, 2015, the <b>minor</b> <b>planet</b> 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In other tributes, a <b>minor</b> <b>planet,</b> 3623 Chaplin – {{discovered}} by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina in 1981 – {{is named after}} Chaplin. Throughout the 1980s, the Tramp image was used by IBM to advertise their personal computers. Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world, and on 15 April 2011, a day before his 122nd birthday, Google celebrated him with a special Google Doodle video on its global and other country-wide homepages. Many countries, spanning six continents, have honoured Chaplin with a postal stamp.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E
5|$|Two teams claim {{credit for}} the {{discovery}} of Haumea. Mike Brown and his team at Caltech discovered Haumea in December 2004 on images they had taken on May 6, 2004. On July 20, 2005, they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery {{at a conference in}} September 2005. At around this time, José Luis Ortiz Moreno and his team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain found Haumea on images taken on March 7–10, 2003. Ortiz emailed the <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a <b>minor</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has an {{exceptionally}} long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 {{years to complete}} and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The <b>Minor</b> <b>Planet</b> Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to informally {{refer to it as}} the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
