5000|$|A {{multimedia}} file structured upon ISO base {{media file}} format may {{be compatible with}} more than one concrete specification, and it is therefore not always possible to speak of a single [...] "type" [...] or [...] "brand" [...] for the file. In this regard, the utility of the <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Extension</b> type and file name extension is somewhat reduced. In spite of that, when a derived specification is written, a new file extension will be used, a new MIME type and a new Macintosh file type.|$|R

40|$|Electronic mail for {{traditional}} text exchange as asynchronous communication means between computer users is widely built upon in many application areas. Whereas Multimedia-Mail systems - including text, graphics, still images, audio, video and documents - {{were limited to}} isolated communities - at least two very promising approaches are being under development: the MIME (<b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Extension),</b> an <b>extension</b> of <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> {{as well as the}} Multimedia Teleservice based on CCITT Recommendation X. 400 (88) being under development within the BERKOM project funded by the German TELEKOM. The store-and-forward mechanism inherent to electronic mail is complemented in the later one by an additional exchange mechanism allowing the resolution of references to message content, e. g. video. Such references may be put into a message in place of the content itself. Internet/MIME and OSI/X. 400, their interworking, asynchronous information server access via Multimedia-Mail, as well as possible future developments especially in the area of asynchronous Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|As this {{protocol}} {{started out}} purely ASCII text-based, {{it did not}} deal well with binary files, or characters in many non-English languages. Standards such as <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Extensions</b> (MIME) were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. Mail transfer agents (MTAs) developed after Sendmail also tended to be implemented 8-bit-clean, so that the alternate [...] "just send eight" [...] strategy {{could be used to}} transmit arbitrary text data (in any 8-bit ASCII-like character encoding) via SMTP. Mojibake was still a problem due to differing character set mappings between vendors, although the email addresses themselves still allowed only ASCII. 8-bit-clean MTAs today tend to support the 8BITMIME extension, permitting binary files to be transmitted almost as easily as plain text. Recently the SMTPUTF8 extension was created to support UTF-8 text, allowing international content and addresses in non-Latin scripts like Cyrillic or Chinese.|$|E

40|$|S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Extensions)</b> is a {{well-known}} standard for secure e-mail exchange. S/MIME builds its identity management on e-mail addresses, rather than real names. This fact may sometimes cause sending a signed e-mail with a bogus name on it. Moreover, header information of a signed e-mail message, such as subject and name, can be altered without affecting the verifiability of the signature. This paper spots the details of such problems of S/MIME and discusses some solutions from both developer and user points of view. Moreover, GUI considerations about these problems are also analyzed in this paper. An ideal GUI is modeled and developed...|$|R

S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined {{in a number of}} documents, most importantly RFCs 3369, 3370, 3850 and 3851. It was originally developed by RSA Data Security Inc. and the original specification used the IETF MIME specification with the de facto industry standard PKCS#7 secure message format. Change control to S/MIME has since been vested in the IETF and the specification is now layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax, an IETF specification that is identical in most respects with PKCS #7. S/MIME functionality is built into the majority of modern email software and interoperates between them.|$|R
