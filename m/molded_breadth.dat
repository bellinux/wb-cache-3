50|$|During {{her second}} rebuild, {{which took place}} during the winter of 1828, Constellation was {{dismantled}} throughout her midsections and her stern section down to the floor. An increase of 17 inches was made to the hull’s maximum molded breath, and added to the 14 inches increase in Constellation hull’s maximum molded beam made in 1813, altered the hull’s maximum <b>molded</b> <b>breadth</b> of beam from 40 feet in 1797 to 42 ft. 7ins., which was the maximum <b>molded</b> <b>breadth</b> upon her departure from Gosport in 1829. Also installed was the newly developed round transom, an elliptic stern and rudder assembly and a new captain’s cabin. The two increases in Constellation’s maximum molded beam resulted in a reduction of her draft from 22 ft. 6ins. 1801 to 20 ft, 6ins. following her rebuild in 1829.|$|E
50|$|Constellation’s {{increase}} of 14 ins. in its hull’s “main breadth” reduced its draft of 22 ft. 6 ins. to 21 ft. 7 ins., {{when the ship}} watered and otherwise ready for sea, which was recorded in 1817 by Captain William Crane, and provided confirmation that Constellation’s added buoyancy {{was the result of}} the hull’s greater maximum <b>molded</b> <b>breadth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Constellation {{entered the}} Boston (Charlestown) Navy Yard dry-dock on 16 February 1839, and during her stay there was rebuilt a third time, which {{included}} a two-foot reduction in the beam’s breadth to address the stressed bow and stern sections that caused the hull’s hog and bottom to leak. Constellation departed the yard with a maximum <b>molded</b> <b>breadth</b> of beam of 40 ft. 7in, which was seven inches greater than when it was launched in 1797.|$|E
50|$|Constellation’s {{repaired}} keel hogged badly {{after years}} at sea; this {{was caused by}} insufficient buoyancy of the hull’s end sections, and probably the result of increases in <b>molded</b> <b>breadth</b> in 1813 and 1828. Constellation entered the yard’s new dry-dock and the keel was lowered onto blocks of varied height that compensated for its hog, to which shipbuilder Frances Grice constructed a false bottom of streaks and planks to curtain its leaks. New planks and copper sheathing were fastened to the streaks {{on both sides of}} the capped keel. Constellation left the yard in January 1835.|$|E
5000|$|Then named Mister Darby, the boat's {{construction}} was completed {{and she was}} delivered to Jackson Marine Corporation on 9 February 1997. [...] Her hull, constructed from ordinary strength steel, has an overall length of 42.9 m, a <b>molded</b> <b>breadth</b> of 6.8 m, and a moulded depth of 6.8 m. [...] The boat has a total of 21 tanks: 12 for fuel oil, 5 for ballast water, 5 for lubricating oil, 7 apiece for fresh- and waste-water, a hydraulic oil tank, a slop tank, and an anchor chain locker. The tug can carry up to 6 cubic meters of fuel, has a gross tonnage of 852 GT and a net tonnage of 205 NT.|$|E
