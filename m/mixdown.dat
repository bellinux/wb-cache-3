5000|$|In 2010 Rampino {{joined with}} Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo, Steve Aoki and Scott Cogo {{to form the}} dance-punk band Rifoki. They {{released}} one EP named [...] "Sperm Donor" [...] in winter 2010. The song [...] "Zombie Attack" [...] featuring vocals from punk band Refused along with Bob Rifo's own vocals. Zombie Attack was successful enough to be included on the 2010 edition of I Love Techno mixed by Steve Aoki. Also it was included on the Dim Mak compitaltion [...] "Dim Mak Hardcore (Punk) Vault". Rifoki is heavily influenced by rock and metal {{but it has a}} dance beat. Rampino plays guitars in the band, Bob Rifo provides vocals and <b>mixdowns</b> along with <b>mixdowns</b> and DJ'ing by Steve Aoki and Scott Cogo.|$|R
50|$|Ping-pong {{recording}} (also called ping-ponging, bouncing tracks, or reduction mixing) is {{a method}} of sound recording. It involves combining multiple track stems into one, allowing more room for overdubbing when using tape recorders with a limited set of tracks. It {{is also used to}} simplify <b>mixdowns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{sound quality}} of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is {{comparable}} to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as compact cassette attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. Home recording enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo <b>mixdowns</b> and master recordings from multitrack audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs. However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR's video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible. A short-lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording <b>mixdowns</b> of hobbyist audio-only projects was a PCM adaptor so that high-bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black-and-white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro-grade digital sounds though DAT tapes made this obsolete.|$|R

2500|$|Until {{very late}} in their career, the [...] "primary" [...] {{version of the}} Beatles' albums was always the {{monophonic}} mix. According to Beatles historian Bruce Spizer, Martin and the EMI engineers devoted {{most of their time}} and attention to the mono <b>mixdowns,</b> and generally regarded stereo as a gimmick. The band were not usually present for the stereo mixing sessions.|$|R
50|$|In the Klang cycle, Cosmic Pulses {{represents}} a turning point. It {{is the beginning}} of the second half of the cycle, and all of the music after the thirteenth hour is electroacoustic, employing partial <b>mixdowns</b> of Cosmic Pulses as the tape accompaniment. A recording of the piece was released on CD 91 by the Stockhausen-Verlag. The CD also presents the beginning moments of all 24 isolated layers on separate tracks.|$|R
5000|$|With {{these two}} songs the Bee Gees inaugurated Festival's new four-track {{recording}} equipment. If the multitrack tapes still existed, stereo mixes {{would have been}} possible but only the mono <b>mixdowns</b> survived. Promotional material for this single asks radio to play both sides, but [...] "I Want Home" [...] is listed first as it has the lower number matrix number, usually indicating the A-side, The lead guitar is played by Maurice. Colin Petersen thinks he played drums on both songs".|$|R
500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final <b>mixdown,</b> he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E
500|$|The master take of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was {{recorded}} on January 20, 1965, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, {{prior to the}} release of Dylan's own version. The song's jangling, melodic guitar playing (performed by McGuinn on a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar) was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. The group's complex harmony work, as featured on [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man," [...] became another major characteristic of their sound. Due to producer Terry Melcher's initial lack of confidence in The Byrds' musicianship, McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on both [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and its B-side, [...] "I Knew I'd Want You." [...] Rather than using band members, Melcher hired The Wrecking Crew, a collection of top L.A. session musicians, who (with McGuinn on guitar) provided the backing track over which McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark sang. By the time the sessions for their debut album began in March 1965, however, Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing. Much of the track's arrangement and final <b>mixdown</b> was modeled after Brian Wilson's production work for the Beach Boys' [...] "Don't Worry Baby".|$|E
500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final <b>mixdown,</b> he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} sixties, Putnam scored a {{significant}} coup when major US record labels began to release stereophonic recordings in large numbers. According to Allen Sides, when stereo {{first appeared in}} the late 1950s, the cost-conscious major labels were initially uninterested, feeling that the market for the new format was limited, and that stereo <b>mixdowns</b> were {{a waste of time and}} money. Putnam however foresaw the coming importance of stereo and, at his own expense, he began making simultaneous mono and stereo <b>mixdowns,</b> storing away the stereo versions of these recordings, which at the time were released only in mono. When stereo took off in the early sixties, Putnam had amassed a very valuable stockpile of more than two-and-a-half years' worth of stereo recordings by scores of major acts. The value of this stockpile can be estimated from Sides' statement that United Western was at this time bringing in around US$200,000 per month in studio billings—equivalent to perhaps US$1 million per month today. The major labels approached Putnam hoping to buy the stereo tape stockpile, but he struck a far more lucrative deal, in which the labels repaid him for the (far more expensive) studio time he had used in making the stereo mixes.|$|R
5|$|On 26 May 2017, {{the album}} was reissued for the album's 50th anniversary in four {{different}} formats: a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set and a six-disc super deluxe edition. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album produced by Giles Martin. Created using modern and vintage technology, the 2017 mix retains more of the idiosyncrasies that were unique to the original mono version of Sgt. Pepper's. Unlike the original album, first-generation tapes were used rather than their subsequent <b>mixdowns,</b> resulting in a clearer and more spacious sound. The other discs contain alternative mixes and previously unreleased session tapes. The six-disc box set includes four CDs {{as well as a}} documentary and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the album in both DVD and Blu-ray form.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the request}} of XTC and Virgin Records, Rundgren {{submitted}} three different <b>mixdowns</b> of the album before quitting the project. According to Partridge, both the label and the band were dissatisfied with the final mix; [...] "We all thought was poor and thin ... There was no bass on it, no high tops, and the middle sounded muddy." [...] Gregory similarly recalled that it was badly recorded. Decades later, {{it was discovered that}} the album's master tapes were engineered with an incorrect sound polarity. Rundgren referenced the issue: [...] "I think it's total bullshit. But if such a thing existed, it's because they changed the running order on it and had to remaster it - and I {{had nothing to do with}} it. What a prick." [...] Mastering engineer John Dent, who discovered the flaw in 2010, attributed it to a wiring error between the multitrack recording and stereo mixing machines, which would not have been aurally evident until after the tapes left Rundgren's studio.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session <b>mixdown</b> master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|He {{characterized}} the song as [...] "advanced rhythm and blues", while its theremin and cello {{has been called}} the song's [...] "psychedelic ingredient". In his book discussing music of the counterculture era, James Perrone stated that the song represented a type of impressionistic psychedelia, in particular for its cello playing repeated bass notes and its theremin. Professor of American history John Robert Greene named [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] among examples of psychedelic or acid rock. Stebbins wrote that the song was [...] "replete with sunshine [...] psychedelia". Uncut wrote that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was [...] "three minutes and thirty-six seconds of avant-garde pop". <b>Mixdown</b> described it as a [...] "masterpiece of avant-pop". Steve Valdez says that, like Pet Sounds, Brian was attempting a more experimental rock style. It has since been marketed as pop music, [...] "possibly because it comes across relatively innocent compared with the hard-edged rock we have since come to know", according to historian Lorenzo Candelaria. Sound on Sound argues that the song [...] "has as many dramatic changes in mood as a piece of serious classical music lasting more than half an hour". Tom Roland of American Songwriter described the piece as being [...] "with its interlocking segments—a sort of pop version of the classical sonata, consisting of a series of musical movements". New York Magazine compared it to [...] "a fugue with a rhythmic beat". John Bush compared the track's fragmented cut-and-paste style to 1960s experimentalists such as William S. Burroughs.|$|E
2500|$|... 3M Mincom was {{involved}} {{in some of the}} first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the [...] "3M Digital Audio Mastering System", which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for <b>mixdown</b> & final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Good Morning Starshine was {{the first}} album {{produced}} by the band members. According to keyboardist Mark Weitz, [...] "It {{was the first}} time Ed and I produced an album without any help. I say Ed and I because we were interested in doing it, and worked well together, right down to the <b>mixdowns.</b> It {{was the first time}} either of us had the chance of really controlling the sound from beginning to end". With Pitman at the helm as one of the prime songwriters, the band began to branch out from their closely associated brand of psychedelic pop to a hard-edged take on blues rock. Pitman's twangy instrumentals and soulful vocals were, in part, a reason for their direction change. More importantly, the band had been lacking a hit single and had hopes that expressing their versatility would appeal to their fan base. Strawberry Alarm Clock did not totally depart from the sound featured on their past albums, as evident with the tracks [...] "Small Package", [...] "(You Put Me On) Stand By", and [...] "Dear Joy".|$|R
2500|$|The Beatles {{completed}} [...] "Wait" [...] for the album, having taped the song's rhythm track {{during the}} sessions for Help! in June 1965. [...] "Day Tripper" [...] and [...] "We Can Work It Out" [...] were also recorded during the Rubber Soul sessions, but issued separately on a non-album single. To mimic {{the sound of}} a harpsichord on [...] "In My Life", after Lennon had suggested he play something [...] "like Bach", Martin recorded the piano solo with the tape running at half-speed. When played back at normal speed during the <b>mixdown,</b> the sped-up sound gave the illusion of a harpsichord.|$|E
2500|$|... "We're Gonna Groove" [...] {{opens the}} album and, {{according}} to the album notes, was recorded at Morgan Studios in June 1969. It was later acknowledged {{to have come from}} a January 1970 concert at the Royal Albert Hall, with the guitar parts overdubbed and the original guitar part removed—this can be heard in the original Royal Albert Hall show on 9 January 1970. This song was used to open a number of concerts on their early 1970 tours and was originally intended to be recorded for inclusion in Led Zeppelin II. [...] "I Can't Quit You Baby" [...] is taken from the same concert as [...] "We're Gonna Groove" [...] but was listed as a rehearsal in the original liner notes. The recording was edited to remove the overall [...] "live" [...] feel: the crowd noise as well as the beginning and ending of the song were deleted. Crowd tracks were muted on the multitrack <b>mixdown</b> on this recording as with [...] "We're Gonna Groove." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track <b>mixdown</b> console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm magnetic film instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|E
