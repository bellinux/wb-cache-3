5|$|An unelected group proclaimed Kentucky's secession {{from the}} Union on November 20, 1861, {{and it was}} annexed by the Confederate States of America on December 10, 1861. The Confederate {{government}} elected two governors (listed separately), but it never held <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over the state, and the main line of governors was preserved.|$|E

5|$|Though the government's ideological {{interest}} in Shinto is well-known, there is {{debate over how}} <b>much</b> <b>control</b> the government had over local shrines, and for how long. Shrine finances were not purely state-supported. Shinto priests, even when state-supported, had tended to avoid preaching on ideological matters until {{the establishment of the}} Wartime Shrine board in 1940.|$|E

50|$|On {{a transit}} flight (getting {{to or from}} a display location) the team may fly at the {{relatively}} low altitude of 1000 ft. This avoids the complication of moving though the cloud base in formation, and also avoids <b>much</b> <b>controlled</b> air space. Jets are more efficient at higher altitude, so longer flights are made at 35000 to 42000 ft. On transit flights, the formation can include spare planes. Sometimes a C-130 Hercules accompanies them, carrying spare parts.|$|R
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how <b>much</b> <b>control</b> the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|In King Arthur and King Cornwall, the Green Knight again {{features}} as Bredbeddle, and {{is depicted as}} one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over the new state.|$|E

40|$|The {{universal}} question {{so often}} asked by instructors is {{how does one}} choose which medium to use for different parts of a course. The questioner usually expects {{to be referred to}} a beautifully constructed algorithm or a carefully balanced analysis of pedagogical factors which will lead to a best choice. No such things exist. Instead choice of media is still very <b>much</b> <b>controlled</b> by logistical financial and internal political factors. 'Gut feeling' is still an important means of selecting media...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers and their creation of the Independent State of Croatia, Stojanović was arrested {{at the behest of}} the Ustaše, Croatia's fascist ruling party. He escaped prison and went to Kozara, where he joined fellow communists that had escaped from Prijedor. The KPJ chose Stojanović to lead the communist uprising in Prijedor. The uprising began on 30July 1941, although neither Stojanović nor any of the other communists had <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over it at this stage. The Serb villagers of the district seized control of a number of villages and threatened Prijedor, which was defended by the Germans, Ustaše, and Croatian Home Guards. In August 1941, Stojanović was recognised as the principal leader of the Kozara insurgents, who were then organised into Partisan military units. Under Stojanović's direction, the Kozara Partisans began attacking the fascists from the end of September 1941. In early November 1941, all Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment, commanded by Stojanović. By the end of the year, most of Kozaracovering about was controlled by Stojanović's detachment.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} wife's estate, Fownes Luttrell {{obtained}} a sanction from the Court of Chancery {{to sell the}} manors of Heathfield and Kilton, but found no buyers; he subsequently attempted to sell the manor of Minehead, and also offered {{at least one of}} the Parliamentary seats for the Borough of Minehead for £30,000, but there were no serious bidders, largely due to the high prices and the fact that Fownes Luttrell had in fact not inherited <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over the seats he was putting up for sale. However, frugal spending helped to recover the estate and Fownes Luttrell invested in 1760 in the manor of Foremarsh, near Dunster, which he purchased from John Poyntz. He went on to buy the manor of Staunton Fry in 1777 and a number of tenements in Dunster. In leisure, he particularly enjoyed hunting, keeping hounds and horses, and cockfighting.|$|E
5|$|Women in the Middle Ages were officially {{required}} to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible {{for taking care of}} the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.|$|E
50|$|However, since Wildavsky's time, {{some would}} argue that the {{domestic}} impact of foreign policy has become more pronounced and important, blurring the lines between foreign and domestic affairs. Politics no longer stop at the waters edge because Congress receives more reliable information on foreign affairs. Foreign policy is very <b>much</b> <b>controlled</b> by partisan politics in the United States today. Presidents no longer may take the liberty to assume public support for his foreign policy initiatives and must strive to build and maintain domestic support for them instead.|$|R

25|$|It is an {{interesting}} point {{to note that the}} selective breeding of cattle was almost impossible before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without <b>much</b> <b>control</b> from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a 'pure breed' was therefore practically impossible.|$|E

25|$|He {{went on to}} {{play with}} trumpeter Maynard Ferguson, where he first met Wayne Shorter after having had an {{influence}} in hiring him. Shorter left soon thereafter to play in Art Blakey's group and Zawinul was apparently dismissed from the Ferguson band for wanting too <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over personnel decisions. Zawinul then toured and recorded with singer Dinah Washington from 1959 to 1961.|$|E
25|$|With Hemu Adhikari, who had captained in this match, being unavailable, Gaekwad led the Indian team to {{the tour}} of England in 1959. He {{suffered}} from illness throughout the series {{and did not have}} <b>much</b> <b>control</b> over the team. It did not help that he had another man from Baroda as the manager, which did not go well with some players. India lost all the five matches and Gaekwad did not appear in another Test.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so <b>much</b> <b>control</b> is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so <b>much</b> <b>control</b> is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E

25|$|Criticisms of {{marriage}} are arguments against the practical or moral {{value of the}} institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony. These have included the effects that marriage has on individual liberty, equality between the sexes, the relation between marriage and violence, philosophical questions about how <b>much</b> <b>control</b> can a government have over its population, the amount of control a person has over another, the financial risk when measured against the divorce rate, and questioning of the necessity {{to have a relationship}} sanctioned by government or religious authorities.|$|E
25|$|In polymer demixing, polymer blends {{experience}} spontaneous phase separation; {{it often}} occurs during {{conditions such as}} spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively. There is not <b>much</b> <b>control</b> in the horizontal direction, though the vertical direction of the features can be precisely controlled. Because the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height nanotopographies.|$|E

The Honduran government does not have <b>much</b> <b>control</b> against the gangs because the government system is not itself very stable. Most of the crime cases are not very well prosecuted and sometimes just discarded, but police enforcement is better on the tourists parts of the city.|$|E
