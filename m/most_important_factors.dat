5|$|Turkey has {{a unitary}} {{structure}} {{in terms of}} administration and this aspect {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey doesn't have a federal system, and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (vali) and town governors (kaymakam). Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents. Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (belediye meclisi) for decision-making on municipal issues.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare investigators’ {{perception}} of three <b>most</b> <b>important</b> etiological <b>factors</b> for drug addiction and drug abuse with the self-perception of heroin addicts and drug abusers who used cannabis products and/or ecstasy. The study included 207 heroin addicts (mean age, 26. 7 ± 5. 8 years) and 238 drug abusers (mean age, 19. 3 ± 1. 9 years). Each study participant selected the three <b>most</b> <b>important</b> etiological <b>factors</b> for drug addiction or drug abuse from the list in the Pompidou questionnaire according to his or her perception. An investigator also selected the three <b>most</b> <b>important</b> etiological <b>factors</b> for drug addiction or abuse according to his or her perception for each study participant. The self-selected factors were compared with those selected by the investigators. Heroin addicts most often selected hedonism as the first (n= 97 [46. 9 %]) and the second (n= 87 [42. 0 %]) <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> for starting using drugs, whereas family reasons were most often selected as the third <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> (n= 58 [28. 0 %]). Cannabis and ecstasy abusers most frequently selected hedonism as the first (n= 149 [62. 6 %]), second (n= 128 [53. 8 %]), and third (n= 76 [31. 9 %]) <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> for starting using drugs. According to investigators’ perception, family reasons were the first <b>most</b> <b>important</b> etiologic <b>factor</b> in both heroin addicts (n= 93 [44. 9 %]) and drug abusers (n= 144 [60. 5 %]). Psychological reasons were significantly more often selected as the first <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> for heroin addiction than for cannabis or ecstasy abuse by both participants and investigators (P< 0. 001 for both). Also, according to investigators’ perception, the lack of knowledge was significantly more frequent as the second <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in heroin addicts than in cannabis or ecstasy abusers (55 [26. 6 %] vs 19 [8. 0 %], respectively; P< 0. 001). Drug addicts and drug abusers considered hedonism the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> reason for starting drug use, whereas investigators considered family reasons to be the primary reason. Both factors seemed to play the crucial role in the development of both drug addiction and drug abuse...|$|R

Anglo-Saxon secondary activity on prehistoric and Roman sites was traditionally explained in practical terms.

Based on the research results, the overall level of customer satisfaction is above 50 %. Besides, women are more satisfied than men. In addition, presence of bank branches is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> of satisfaction and preferred more by people with university education.

The difficulty of commanding the scene was extreme and good Fireforce commanders were highly prized by the men.|$|E

It also prevents the entry of air masses, with the exception of some coastal low clouds that penetrate to the basin through the river valleys.|$|E
