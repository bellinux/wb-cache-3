5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to be too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and {{he dropped out of}} the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship {{of the state in}} 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and serving was his way of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to control {{even if he had}} wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E

5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E

25|$|In October, Snow Patrol {{embarked}} on a second European Tour. The tour saw them visit countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France. Artists like The Cinematics, Declan O'Rourke, Asyl and Joseph D'Anvers supported the band throughout the tour on different dates. Midway through the tour, Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder. The bassist had been having a little muscle strain, but he had ignored the pain and carried on playing. It built up and became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to play on-stage. As a result, four French and two German dates were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a regular}} visitor to Lord's, The Canterbury and Scarborough Festivals up {{until his death in}} May 1915. He died just six days after his {{youngest}} son Edward was killed in action at Aubers Ridge. His elder son Major Chandos Leigh was the first Harrovian to be killed in the war, at Mons in August 1914, and the second blow was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He died, in the same year as W. G. Grace and his good friend Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, of a broken heart mourning the loss of his two sons {{and the end of the}} golden age of cricket.|$|E
25|$|At around 2:30a.m. (CST) on 4 November 2014, {{an elite}} {{squadron}} of the Federal Police arrested former Iguala mayor Abarca {{and his wife}} Pineda at {{a house in the}} Tenorios neighborhood in Iztapalapa, Mexico City. Neither of them resisted arrest. Abarca confessed that he was tired of hiding and that the pressure was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> His wife, on the other hand, showed her disdain for law enforcement. The arrest was confirmed through Twitter by the Federal Police spokesperson José Ramón Salinas early that morning. Once in custody, they were taken by law enforcement to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigation agency, for their legal declaration. At the time of their arrest, Abarca and Pineda were among Mexico's most-wanted.|$|E

25|$|On 1 December 1942, General Fleischer {{was ordered}} to the {{position}} of Military Attaché to Washington D.C. This was another obvious humiliation, since usually officers of the ranks of Major or Lieutenant-Colonel served in this role. Being too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to swallow, he shot himself with his own gun through the heart on 19 December 1942. He was found by his adjutant Lieutenant Richard Brinck-Johnsen who brought the urn with the General's ashes to London in a Liberator aircraft. In London Brinck-Johnsen {{was ordered to}} keep the circumstances of Fleischer's death secret. Only in 1995 did Brinck-Johnsen speak out, stating that in his opinion Fleischer had taken his own life in sorrow of being set aside and not being needed by anyone.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{season begins}} {{a year after}} the {{conclusion}} of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, as it may be too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to handle, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.|$|E

Shortly after he began his forays into real estate, a health inspector declared his zoo unhygienic and demanded he install lavatories. Nelson did, but the Health Department found them [...] "unsatisfactory", and in 1960 {{he was forced to}} close his zoo. With no income, the taxes on the land became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and he ended up borrowing $100,000 ($ in today's dollars) to pay them.|$|E
