5|$|ILM's {{computer}} graphics division {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the surface.|$|E
5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> p, while a is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
50|$|The FC Twin console uses SNES {{compatible}} controllers {{and devices}} such as the Super Scope, Konami Justifier and the SNES mouse, but cannot use NES compatible controllers and devices. Qi Sheng has {{its own version of}} the NES Zapper which is compatible with games that require use of the NES Zapper. The Super NES controller buttons otherwise <b>map</b> <b>to</b> the NES controller inputs (B <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> Y, A <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> B. A <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> turbo B, X <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> turbo A; L and R serve no function). When using any controllers besides the actual FC Twin ones, A and X do not have these added turbo features.|$|R

There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads {{category}} of agency but Geoff Hart states [...] "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, {{depending on the}} nature of the information." ...|$|R

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> {{reveal a}} phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages {{from a common}} ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E

5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E
5|$|As {{there were}} only six seismometers {{operating}} in Washington state and western British Columbia even as late as 1969, there are insufficient instrumental records for older events in the region. Focal depths are unknown for shocks that occurred before that time, but seismologists Bakun et al. concluded that the event occurred on a shallow fault {{on the east side}} of the Cascade Range. They employed a method that was developed by W. H. Bakun and C. M. Wentworth for using earthquake intensity information that could be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> a corresponding moment magnitude. The intensities for twelve 20th-century Pacific Northwest earthquakes were used for calibration before analyzing the known intensities for the 1872 event in an attempt to resolve the location and magnitude. The reports were interpreted in a way that placed the epicenter near the south end of Lake Chelan, but other considerations left other plausible focal points both north and northeast of the lake. The magnitude was estimated to be 6.5–7.0 with 95% confidence.|$|E
5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E
50|$|This form of {{triangular}} <b>mapping</b> recursively generalizes <b>to</b> vectors of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly {{mapping the}} first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> (5,3), which <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> 39.|$|R
