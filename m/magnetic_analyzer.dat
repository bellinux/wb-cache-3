50|$|Depending on the SIMS type, {{there are}} three basic analyzers available: sector, quadrupole, and time-of-flight. A sector field mass {{spectrometer}} uses a combination of an electrostatic analyzer and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>analyzer</b> to separate the secondary ions by their mass to charge ratio. A quadrupole mass analyzer separates the masses by resonant electric fields, which allow only the selected masses to pass through. The time of flight mass analyzer separates the ions in a field-free drift path according to their velocity. Since all ions possess the same kinetic energy the velocity and therefore time of flight varies according to mass. It requires pulsed secondary ion generation using either a pulsed primary ion gun or a pulsed secondary ion extraction. It is the only analyzer type able to detect all generated secondary ions simultaneously, and is the standard analyzer for static SIMS instruments.|$|E

Sensitivity <b>magnetic</b> spectrometer <b>analyzer</b> is determined by the depth of penetration of high frequency currents in metals, the space of the sample, and the phase shift between its resistance and reactance. Sensitivity is the ratio of (delta epsilon/epsilon) /(delta d/d), where delta epsilon/epsilon relative increase signal of MSA. The increment signal arises due to a change delta delta/delta penetration depth of the eddy current in the metal. Parameter delta d/d is the relative change in the thickness of the samples. To study the sensitivity of the spectrometer used for S parameter (delta epsilon/epsilon) /(delta S/S). These options allow you to eliminate or reduce the error in determining the conductivity.

The system has the usual well-calibrated mass-separation using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>analyzer.</b> A pre- or post-implant mass spectrum through this analyzer can give a useful understanding of unintended ions within the source beam, but it does not provide direct identification for such ions as CO or diatomic nitrogen- 14 when implanting silicon- 28.

The verification system consists of a back-angle particle detector along with a movable temporary target consisting of a very thin film of gold on a carbon or silicon substrate.

The phase composition was analyzed using the database (PCPDFWIN and PDF- 4 +) and the full-profile analysis programs (POWDERCELL 2. 5). The change in the hydrogenation of titanium leads to a change in the concentration of defects and the behavior of eddy currents depending on the frequency.

Particular attention was focused on time-resolved measurements of the fast electron beams by means of two different <b>magnetic</b> <b>analyzers,</b> which could record electrons of energy ranging from about 41 keV to about 715 keV in several (6 or 8) measuring channels. For discharges performed with the pure deuterium filling, many strong electron signals were recorded in all the measuring channels. Those signals were well correlated with the first hard X-ray pulse detected by an external scintillation neutron-counter. In some of the analyzer channels, electron spikes (lasting about dozens of nanoseconds) and appearing in different instants after the current peculiarity (so-called current dip) were also recorded.
