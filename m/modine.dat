The story is presented in flashbacks, with a frame narrative depicting Birdy and Al's traumatic experiences upon serving in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk.

5|$|Tri-Star {{intended}} to give Birdy a platform release which involved opening it in select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. However, the film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in the studio cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1.4 million against a budget of $12 million. It received a mostly positive critical response from critics who praised the film's plot and direction, as well as <b>Modine</b> and Cage's performances.

5|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate <b>Modine's</b> shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull.|$|R

5|$|Tri-Star Pictures {{had planned}} to release the film using a {{platform}} technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A Films prompted the studio to refocus the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, <b>Modine</b> and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, well below its estimated budget of $12 million.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On {{was used}} as the basis for a 1993 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO {{television}} film of the same name. It was produced by Aaron Spelling, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, and starred Matthew <b>Modine</b> as epidemiologist Don Francis and Richard Masur as William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control. Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for union-scale pay. The film was released the same year as Philadelphia and , which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it. Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS. However, And the Band Played On, along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} {{hour or so}} of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew <b>Modine</b> (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Huế, a Vietnamese city, to clear it of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick had the whole {{gasworks}} selectively demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile.

[...] Film critic Richard Eder contrasted the film's realistic nightmarishness with the more innocent qualities {{that came to be}} associated with American cartoons.

500|$|... "Crazy for You" [...] {{was written}} by John Bettis and Jon Lind.

500|$|Kubrick met author Michael Herr through {{mutual friend}} David Cornwell (novelist John le Carré) in 1980, and became {{interested}} in his book Dispatches, about the Vietnam War. Herr had recently written Martin Sheen's narration for Apocalypse Now (1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by Gustav Hasford's Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers. With the vision in mind to shoot what would become Full Metal Jacket (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford's novel to be [...] "brutally honest" [...] and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. All of the film was shot {{at a cost of}} $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. A derelict gasworks in Beckton in the London Docklands area posed as the ruined city of Huế, which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a [...] "newsreel effect" [...] by making the Steadicam shots less steady, [...] which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film. According to critic Michel Ciment, the film contained some of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene where United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and totally destroyed city, the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club is heard as a sardonic counterpoint. The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone, but critically it was [...] overshadowed by the success of Oliver Stone's Platoon, released a year earlier. According to one review, notes co-star Matthew <b>Modine,</b> [...] "The first half of FMJ is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece." [...] Roger Ebert was not particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: [...] "Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is more like a book of short stories than a novel", a [...] "strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Modine</b> {{described}} the shoot as difficult: Beckton Gas Works was a toxic and environmental nightmare {{for the entire}} film crew. Asbestos {{and hundreds of other}} chemicals poisoned the earth and air. <b>Modine</b> documents details of shooting at Beckton in his book, Full Metal Jacket Diary (2005). During the [...] "Boot Camp" [...] sequence of the film, <b>Modine</b> and the other recruits had to endure the rigors of Marine Corps training, including having Ermey yelling at them for 10 hours a day during the shooting of the Parris Island scenes. To ensure the actors' reactions to Ermey were as authentic and fresh as possible, Ermey and the recruits did not rehearse together. For film continuity, each recruit had to have his head shaved once a week.|$|E
