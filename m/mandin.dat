40|$|Belmiloud, et al have {{recently}} {{suggested that the}} HITRAN line intensities in the 1130 nm water vapor band are much too weak. Giver, et at corrected unit conversion errors to make the HITRAN intensities compatible with the original measurements of <b>Mandin,</b> et al, but Belmiloud, et al believe {{that many of those}} line intensity measurements were too weak, and they propose the total intensity of the 1130 nm water vapor band is 38 % stronger than the sum of the HITRAN line intensities in this region. We have made independent assessments of this proposal using 2 spectra obtained with the Ames 25 meter base path White cell. The first was made using the moderate resolution (8 nm) solar spectral flux radiometer (SSFR) flight instrument with a White cell absorbing path of 506 meters and 10 torr water vapor pressure. Modeling this spectrum using the HITRAN linelist gives a reasonable match, and the model is not compatible when the HITRAN line intensities are increased by 38 %. The second spectrum was obtained with a White cell path of 1106 meters and 12 torr water vapor pressure, using a Bomem FTIR with near Doppler width resolution. This spectrum is useful for measuring intensities of isolated weak lines to compare with the measurements of <b>Mandin,</b> et al. Unfortunately, as Belmiloud et al point out, at these conditions the strong lines are much too saturated for good intensity measurements. Our measurements of the weak lines are in reasonable agreement with those of <b>Mandin,</b> et al. Neither of our spectra supports the proposal of Belmiloud et al for a general 38 % increase of the absorption intensity in the 1130 nm water vapor band...|$|E

40|$|There {{are nearly}} 800 water Vapor-lines in the 13, 200 - 16, 500 /cm region {{that do not}} have rovibrational {{assignments}} in the HITRAN database. The positions and intensities in the database were determined by <b>Mandin</b> et al., but assignments could not be determined at that time. Polyansky, et al. have now assigned over 600 of the unassigned lines in the 11, 200 - 16, 500 /cm region. Schwenke has also given rovibrational assignments to many of these unassigned lines throughout the visible and near-infrared. Both articles changed the assignments of some HITRAN lines. Carleer et al. extend assignments to some weaker lines measured by them on new spectra with excellent signal/noise. However, some lines measured by <b>Mandin</b> et al. were omitted by Carleer, et al. because of blends due to lower spectral resolution. The rovibrational assignments of Polyansky et al. completely agree with those in Schwenke's article for only about 200 lines. However, Schwenke's ab initio line list is available on his internet site ([URL] A detailed comparison of the Polyansky et al. line list, the Carleer et al. line list, and Schwenke's ab initio line list shows a larger number of agreements. In many cases the disagreement is only about the vibrational and/or rotational upper level, while there is agreement on the lower state assignment and energy level, "E", which is of primary importance for atmospheric applications. We will present a line list of "consensus" assignments in the 13, 200 - 16, 500 /cm region for consideration of inclusion on the HITRAN and GEISA databases. This will substantially reduce the number of unassigned lines on the databases in this spectral region...|$|E

In the present work, line mixing effects have been considered at low temperatures using state-to-state collisional rates which were modeled by a fitting law based on the energy gap and a few fitting parameters. To validate the model, several spectra of methyl bromide perturbed by nitrogen have been recorded at various temperatures (205 - 299 K) and pressures (230 - 825 hPa). Comparisons between measured spectra and calculations using both direct calculation from relaxation operator and Rosenkranz profile have been performed showing improvement compared to the usual Lorentz profile. Note that the temperature dependence of the spectroscopic parameters has been taken into account using results of previous studies...|$|E

40|$|Although gross {{anatomical}} instruction {{has always}} been considered a foundation for medical education and practice, curricular changes have altered {{the manner in which}} it is taught. The integration of basic biomedical sciences began with the case-western reserve curriculum. Under the leadership of Dr. Henry <b>Mandin,</b> the University of Calgary School of Medicine developed a program of medical instruction based on 120 clinical presentation schemes. The Paul L Foster School of Medicine is currently using this approach in teaching its first class of freshman medical students. Three-dimensional ultrasound and the other visual modalities—radiography, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —have greatly increased our ability to visualize anatomical structures. Three-dimensional ultrasound has great potential for use in the curriculum at Paul L Foster School of Medicine. For example, it can help the student differentiate between the varieties of pelvic mass, which can be subdivided into ovarian, tubal, and uterine causes. This paper demonstrates the ways that Doppler three-dimensional ultrasound can help the student differentiate between these anatomical diagnoses. Coupling ultrasound with the histopathologi...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of vaccinia virus on mitosis and DNA synthesis of infected cell cultures {{has been studied}} {{by a number of}} investigators but their findings are contradictory. Carr~re, <b>Mandin,</b> and Pourquier (3) have reported a slight increase of the incidence of mitosis in the KB cells at 48 hr after infection. Magee and coworkers (15, 16), on the basis of radioantographic and biochemical studies, have observed a temporary enhancement of total DNA synthesis of infected Hela cells. These latter findings were not confirmed by other authors (7, 8). By contrast the results of Kitt and Dubbs (9 - 13) show plainly that infection of various kinds of cell cultures with the authors ' strain of vaccinia virus causes a rapid reduction of mitosis and repression of the synthesis of cellular DNA. This lack of agreement is ascribed by the above mentioned authors to difficulties in interpretation caused by the fact that two opposing processes are taking place simultanously in infected cells; i. e., a partial shutdown of host cell DNA synthesis and the initiation of viral DNA synthesis.
