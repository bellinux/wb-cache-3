25|$|Navajo was an {{attractive}} choice for code use because few {{people outside the}} Navajo had learned to speak the language. Virtually no books in Navajo had been published. Outside of the language, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards. It would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers could have worked together effectively. The Japanese {{had an opportunity to}} attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code talker, was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> him. When he reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.|$|E
25|$|With The Rock {{defeating}} Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin {{was set to}} face The Rock at WrestleMania. In {{the weeks}} leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis, even sharing a beer with him and turning heel for the first time since 1997. This decision has been highly criticised by many, including Austin himself, as Austin was such a top-level face that many agreed it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> turn him heel.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{inevitable}} punishment {{of the rebels}} had occurred, the Persians were {{in the mood for}} conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. [...] Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.|$|E

He predicted conservative judges would replace anyone appointed by the Attorney General with a choice more to their liking. He predicted the investigation would likely last as long as the President was in office and beyond.

2500|$|Congress, {{under the}} control of {{conservative}} Republicans, agreed to the program for multiple reasons. The 20-member conservative isolationist Senate wing of the party, based in the rural Midwest and led by Senator Kenneth S. Wherry (R-Nebraska), was outmaneuvered by the emerging internationalist wing, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg (R-Michigan). The opposition argued that it would be [...] "a wasteful 'operation rat-hole'"; that it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential. Vandenberg, assisted by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (R-Massachusetts) admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator Robert A. Taft (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] in [...] "the world battle against communism." [...] In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948 A bill granting an initial $5 billion passed Congress with strong bipartisan support. Congress would eventually allocate $12.4 billion in aid over the four years of the plan.|$|E
50|$|This leads one {{to believe}} that Plato {{somewhat}} telescoped the happenings of the sixth century. For his purposes, Solon lived just before Anacreon, and Anacreon in turn {{was active in the}} early fifth century. The elder Critias is unknown to have achieved any personal distinction, and since he died long before Plato published the Timaeus and Critias, it would have <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Plato <b>to</b> choose a statesman to appear in these dialogues, who was practically unknown and thus uninteresting to his contemporaries.|$|R

Specifically, many European papers contended his victory in Stage 9, in which he {{seemingly}} ascended the Alps with almost no difficulty, could not have been possible through natural means. Armstrong adamantly denied this, and the American press generally supported him. Armstrong contended, among other things, that it would have <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for him <b>to</b> dope since he lived in France for most of the year; France has some of the strictest anti-doping laws in the world.|$|R

2500|$|Malbim {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure," [...] to mean that since the money being brought to Egypt {{from all over the}} world was only [...] "a treasure" [...] – that is, hidden away in the treasury until the time of the Exodus from Egypt, when it would become the Israelites' – the steward told the brothers that their treasure could remain in their sacks, for it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> place it in Pharaoh's treasury, when it was destined for them in any case. Professor Nahum M. Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the steward's reassuring reply was intelligible only on the assumption that he was privy to Joseph's scheme. [...] His purpose was to lull the brothers into a false sense of relief. Professor Robert Alter of University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the steward dismissed the brothers' fears by introducing a kind of fairy tale explanation for the silver that they found in their bags. But Professor Jon D. Levenson of Harvard Divinity School wrote that the steward sensed the hand of a beneficent Providence in the strange events.|$|E
2500|$|Fifth, Stevens {{criticized the}} majority's {{fear that the}} {{government}} could use BCRA §203 to censor the media. The focus placed on this hypothetical fear <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> him {{because it did not}} relate to the facts of this case – if the government actually attempted to apply BCRA §203 to the media (and assuming that Citizens United could not constitute [...] "media"), the Court could deal with the problem at that time. Stevens described the majority's supposed protection of the media as nothing more than posturing. According to him, it was the majority's new rule, announced in this case, that prohibited a law from distinguishing between [...] "speakers" [...] or funding sources. This new rule would be the only reason why media corporations could not be exempted from BCRA §203. In this, Stevens and the majority conceptualize the First Amendment's protection of [...] "the press" [...] quite differently. Stevens argues that the [...] "Press" [...] is an entity, which can be distinguished from other persons and entities which are not [...] "press". The majority opinion viewed [...] "freedom of the press" [...] as an activity, applicable to all citizens or groups of citizens seeking to publish views.|$|E

By October 1954 about 18% of the car was produced locally. In 1955 MITI began to think that Isuzu was not moving quickly enough to localise production, apparently suspecting that Rootes was deliberately causing delays.

5000|$|In {{a series}} of books, {{especially}} The Language of Morals (1952), Freedom and Reason (1963), and Moral Thinking (1981), Hare gave shape to a theory that he called universal prescriptivism. According to this, moral terms such as 'good', 'ought' and 'right' have two logical or semantic properties: universalizability and prescriptivity. By the former, he meant that moral judgments must identify the situation they describe according to a finite set of universal terms, excluding proper names, but not definite descriptions. By the latter, he meant that moral agents must perform those acts they consider themselves to {{have an obligation to}} perform whenever they are physically and psychologically able to do so. In other words, he argued that it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for someone <b>to</b> say, sincerely: [...] "I ought to do X," [...] and then fail to do X.
