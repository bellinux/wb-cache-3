This joint must be firestopped in a flexible manner. For concrete block walls that are not load-bearing, the contractor is often instructed to stop the wall about 25mm short of the slab above. The drywaller has to fasten a track to {{the underside of}} the slab above, which holds the metal studs. The drywall is then either stopped short allowing for a flexible buffer to be inserted or caulked in place, or one may use purpose-made tracks that hold the studs but permit up and down movement without damage to the system.|$|E

40|$|Background: People {{vary greatly}} in their {{response}} to painful stimuli, from those with a low pain threshold to those with indifference to pain. However, insensitivity to pain is a rare disorder, characterized {{by the lack of}} usual subjective and objective responses to noxious stimuli. Patients who have congenital indifference to pain sustain painless injuries beginning in infancy, but have sensory responses that are otherwise normal on examination. Perception of passive <b>movement,</b> <b>joint</b> position, and vibration is normal in these patients, as are tactile thresholds and light touch perception. Case report: A twelve-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for a painless deformity, degeneration in both knees and a neglected femoral neck fracture that was inappropriately painless. Further examination revealed normal sensory responses, perception of passive <b>movement,</b> <b>joint</b> position, vibration tactile thresholds and light touch perception. Spinal cord and brain MRI were normal as was the electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) examination. There was no positive family history for this disorder. Conclusion: The deficits present in the different pain insensitivity syndromes provide insight into the complex anatomical and physiological nature of pain perception. Reports on pain asymbolia, in which pain is perceived but does not cause suffering, and related cortical conditions illustrate that there can be losses that independently involve either the sensory-discriminative component or the affective-motivational component of pain perception, thus highlighting their different anatomical localization.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{well-known}} {{fact that the}} rolling movement always has a lower friction compared to sliding friction, the authors have conceived and realized a pivoting <b>movement</b> <b>joint</b> on a “layer of balls ” with “compensation space”, placed between the acetabular cup and the femoral head. This technical solution allows free self-directed migration of the balls, depending on the resistance opposed, with successive occupation of the “compensation space”. As a concept, the proposed technical solution excludes {{the existence of a}} cage for maintaining the relative positions of the spheres. It can be observed that the smallest values of the force and of the friction coefficient are obtained for the prostheses with balls and self-directed movement (approximately 5 times smaller than the values obtained for a classical prosthesis). For all the couples tested, the friction force grows with the growth of the normal load and of the oscillation speed. Changing the contact mechanism for the artificial hip joint from one sliding contact between two large surfaces, to a multitude of rolling contacts, could lead to some problems regarding functionality and durability of the active prosthesis elements. The key to an accurate evaluation of damaging mechanisms acting on THP with self directed rolling balls is a clear and complete picture of the load transfer mechanism.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of the literature concerning the various causes of failures of external wall tile finishes. Design/methodology/approach - A 4 × 3 matrix hierarchy framework is developed for a systematic analysis of the literature reviewed. Findings - The findings from this paper indicate the importance of environmental effects, <b>movement</b> <b>joints,</b> and adhesive on the performance of external wall tile finishes. Thermal and moisture effects induce movement of tiles, and the failure of the tiling system depends very much on the adhesive strength and the provision of <b>movement</b> <b>joints.</b> Workmanship is also a key factor affecting the performance of external wall tile finishes and should not be overlooked. Research limitations/implications - Various studies have been carried out on the causes of defects in external finishes in the past.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how women who have incurred ACL injury for more than 10 years ago, feel that the injury affects them today. Method: A qualitative semi-structured interview survey with five women who 10 - 28 years ago incurred the anterior cruciate ligament injuries when playing handball or soccer has been performed. The study has been inspired by a phenomenological concept of science, mainly by life-world concept. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Main result: Some informants have experienced severe loss of physical ability in both daily living situations and in training, while others did not appreciably felt impacted in daily living and experienced great opportunities for physical activity. Limitations which emerged were restrictions in <b>movement,</b> <b>joint</b> stiffness, pain, swelling, and crepitations that led to the loss of physical ability. One respondent had been diagnosed with advanced osteoarthritis. The reduced capacity affected both everyday situations, at work and in certain training situations. The view of their physical condition also showed to be impaired due to knee injury. The respondents also expressed that they were emotionally affected. Emotional states such as frustration, sadness, debilitating emotions and depression, but also joy and relief were described by the respondents. Participants in the survey reported that they feel strongly influenced by fear of new injury. This in turn has led them to develop fear of everyday situations where new damage could potentially occur, such as stepping in potholes, go on curbs, quick turns and stumbling. Some even feel socially inhibited due to knee injury. The injury has also caused mixed feelings about the future, where some have expressed concern, while others see the future with confidence. Conclusion: The results may indicate that the population studied is not sufficiently rehabilitated and recovered emotionally after injury. Variations in perceived impacts were seen. This was attributed to the informant’s life-world. Although some strains may appear to be of similar nature, the informants have been affected in differently in their ways of living...|$|E
40|$|Masonry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used building material for construction of low rise buildings and even for infill-walls of some high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka. Propagation of cracks in masonry walls {{is one of the main}} problems in masonry structures as it affects aesthetics and serviceability greatly. Movement in masonry is the prime cause for such cracks. Especially when movements are restrained, stresses will be set up which may lead to cracking. Even though these cracks may not be of structural significance, due to the difficulties in concealing them permanently and due to increase in maintenance costs of buildings, it has become one of the main concerns in the construction industry. In a few Codes of Practice and Standards, various guidelines are stipulated to control cracking in masonry, but still there are no hard and fast rules for predicting movements accurately at the design stage, due to its complexity. The guidelines specified for design of movement joints for masonry in other countries cannot be directly used in Sri Lanka for local masonry, due to differences in environmental conditions and material properties. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a methodology for <b>movement</b> <b>joint</b> design and a specification of movement joints for masonry structures in Sri Lanka. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive research study was carried out. It consisted of a literature survey, a field study, an experimental study, a theoretical study and a finite element study. The literature survey was carried out to identify the important parameters to be studied, to assess the current state of knowledge, and to gather necessary information on the design of movement joints. A field study was carried out by conducting a detailed questionnaire survey to collect information on cracking of local masonry walls. Most of the houses had at least one or more cracked walls and majority of the cracks was present only in the superstructure. Wall thickness, exposure to direct sunlight /rain, wall length/height ratio, existence of openings, cross sectional variations in walls, and existence of wall junctions or wall returns were found to be influential parameters on movements. The experimental study included an extensive investigation of movements in different types of masonry wall panels, where 34 wall panels were tested for movements over long period of time till movements stabilized. As brickwork {{is the most}} widely used masonry material in Sri Lanka, greater emphasis was given to it. With these tests, long-term movements in different types of masonry were investigated. Numerous tests were also carried out to determine the required properties of brickwork and constituents of brickwork, needed for the theoretical study and the finite element study. The experimental study also resulted in the development of a simple, accurate and inexpensive method for measurement of long term movements in masonry. A theoretical model accounting for elastic, creep, shrinkage and thermal deformations of bricks and mortar was developed with an accuracy of 96 % to predict the long-term movements in masonry, which can be used to investigate various aspects which influence design of movement joints for masonry walls. Parametric study highlighted its usefulness. A finite element analysis, using SAP 2000 with thin shell elements, was carried out to study the behaviour of masonry walls subjected to restrained shrinkage, using varying sizes and varying end conditions of a rectangular wall. Significant influence of L/H ratios of walls on stresses iii developed in masonry walls was seen. Influence of openings, wall returns, and restraints were also studied. Finally a methodology for design of movement joints was developed and presented. Further, simplified guidelines for design of movement joints with minimum calculations, were also proposed. Some important conclusions of the study were that moisture expansion of local bricks is insignificant in comparison to that reported for high strength bricks in other countries; movement of local masonry can be described by three parameters maximum shrinkage (ε 0), maximum expansion (εex) and critical shrinkage (εcr) of which last is the most decisive parameter; and first year after construction is the critical period as regards movement of local masonry...|$|E
40|$|The synergy {{of human}} arm and {{wearable}} robot systems studies the compatibility of a wearable robot {{system and its}} operators. Ideally, the motion of a wearable robot system should be dynamically transparent to a healthy operator, sensitively responsible to the voluntary and involuntary motions of its operator. When used for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation and/or power augmentation, a wearable robot system is expected to provide assist to the operator's motor skills and correct the abnormal movements resulted from motor disabilities. Inspired by the control strategies of human motor system, the robot systems can be more dexterous in manipulations and more adaptable to various tasks and uncertain environments. The study on synergy of human arm and wearable robot systems intends {{to find out the}} motor control strategies that dominate human arm movements, in order to apply to the control of robotic systems, such as the upper limb exoskeletons and the surgical robot systems. This research experimentally investigated the arm movements in various tasks, to enhance the understanding of human motor control and to benefit the control robotic systems. With the data collected from point-to-point reaching movements, it proposed a redundancy resolution methodology based on multi-criterion performance optimization, which provides real-time predictions of arm postures with improved accuracy. Based on the comparison between reaching and reach-to-grasp movements, it further studied arm postures affected by grasping orientations and pointed out the control strategy that dominates the macro- and micro- structure coordination. From both healthy subjects and stroke patients, experimental data of unimanual and bimanual movements are recorded for identical tasks. The statistical analysis shows that motor function of the paretic arm can be improved when moving symmetrically with the non-paretic arm, which reveals the beneficial effects of the inter-arm coupling on stroke rehabilitation. The dissertation contributed to answer the following three research questions:*	How to predict the natural arm postures of reaching movement?The kinematic redundancy of the human arm enables the elbow position to rotate about the axis going through the shoulder and wrist, which results in infinite possible arm postures when the arm reaches to a target in a 3 -dimensional workspace. To infer the control strategy the human motor system uses to resolve redundancy in reaching movements, this research compares five redundancy resolution criteria and evaluates their arm posture prediction performance using data on healthy human motion. Two synthesized criteria are developed to provide better real-time arm posture prediction than the five individual criteria. Of these two, the criterion synthesized using an exponential method predicts the arm posture more accurately than that using a least squares approach, and therefore is preferable for inferring the contributions of the individual criteria to motor control during reaching movements. As a methodology contribution, this paper proposes a framework to compare and evaluate redundancy resolution criteria for arm motion control. A cluster analysis which associates criterion contributions with regions of the workspace provides a guideline for designing a real-time motion control system applicable to upper-limb exoskeletons for stroke rehabilitation. *	How do the arm joints coordinate in reach-to-grasp movement?Reach-to-grasp movements are widely observed in activities of daily living, particularly in tool manipulations. In order to reduce the complexity in redundancy resolution and facilitate upper-limb exoskeleton control in reach-to-grasp tasks, we studied joint coordination in the human arm during such movements. Experimental data were collected on reach-to-grasp movements in a 3 -dimensional (3 D) workspace for cylinder targets of different positions and grasping orientations. For comparison, reaching movements toward the same targets are also recorded. In the kinematic analysis, the redundant degree of freedom in human arm is represented by the swivel angle. The four grasping-relevant degrees of freedom (GR-DOFs), including the swivel angle and the three wrist joints, behave differently in reach-to-grasp movements comparing to how they behave in reaching movements. The ratio of active motion range (R-AMR) is proposed for quantitatively comparison the task-relevance of the GR-DOFs. Analysis on the R-AMR values shows that the task-relevant GR-DOFs are more actively used, while the task-irrelevant joints are left uncontrolled and maintain their neutral positions. Among the task-relevant GR-DOFs, the smaller joints (micro-structure) are more actively used than the larger joints (macro-structure). The coordination of the task-relevant GR-DOFs is shown to be synergistic. Analysis of the acceleration/deceleration at the GR-DOFs indicates different levels of voluntary control in three phases of the movements. The study of the characteristics of the joint coordination in reach-to-grasp movements provides guidelines for simplifying the control of the upper limb exoskeleton. *	Can the bilateral training benefit the post-stroke stroke recovery?Bilateral training has been used for post-stroke rehabilitation of patients with paretic upper arms. This training method exploits the inter-arm coupling in bimanual movements which tends to synchronize the paretic arm with the non-paretic arm for motor function recovery. Different levels of motor function recovery have been reported in clinical studies, yet the efficacy of bilateral training is still not clear. As a result, this paper collected data on bimanual symmetric reaching movements in a 3 -dimensional (3 D) workspace from ten healthy subjects and eight chronic stroke patients, to investigate the effects of inter-arm coupling. In reaching experiments, identical tasks are also performed unimanually and recorded. Mapping variables are proposed to measure arm behavior changes and to quantify the similarity of the movements of the two arms. Among the four proposed mapping variables, mapping linearity and mapping complexity were found to reflect both the motion complexity and the task-relevance of a joint, while the other two variables captured changes in motion range and relative velocity. Statistical analysis shows that inter-arm coupling increases inter-arm symmetry more at task-relevant joints than at task-irrelevant joints. To achieve symmetric bimanual movement, the dominant arm of healthy subjects and the non-paretic arm of stroke patients deviate more from their unilateral behavior than the non-dominant/paretic arms. For stroke patients, the effect of inter-arm coupling on arm function depends on the task-relevance of a joint. During bimanual <b>movement,</b> <b>joint</b> behavior at task-irrelevant joints is different from behavior during unimanual movement, which implies that bimanual rehabilitation may help break abnormal movement patterns for these joints. For task-relevant joints, the average arm posture of the paretic arm is significantly higher in bimanual movement, which indicates the possible efficacy of bilateral rehabilitation...|$|E
