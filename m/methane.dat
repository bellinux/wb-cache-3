5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} <b>methane</b> in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System. This suggests that <b>methane</b> must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself.

5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because <b>methane</b> is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for <b>methane</b> ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of <b>methane</b> to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not <b>methane.</b>|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} {{protocol for}} one pot synthesis of bis(indolyl) <b>methanes</b> from primary alcohols is investigated with N-bromosuccinimde {{as a catalyst}} under ultrasound irradiation. Alcohols can be converted into carbonyl compounds by removal of hydrogen in presence of N-bromosuccinimde as an oxidant and can react in situ with indole to give desired bis(indolyl) <b>methanes.</b> In the reported one pot multicomponent condensation reaction N-bromosuccinimde promotes the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde, facilitating the subsequent condensation with indole to afford bis(indolyl) <b>methanes</b> in good to excellent yields. The inexpensiveness and easy handling are some of important feature of N-bromosuccinimde. The by-product N-succinimide can be easily recovered and recycled to N-bromosuccinimide. ...|$|R
5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for <b>methane</b> ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of <b>methane</b> further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of <b>methane.</b> Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to <b>methane</b> and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% <b>methane.</b> The detection of <b>methane</b> and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak <b>methane</b> absorption bands indicate that <b>methane</b> on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for <b>methane</b> to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as <b>methane</b> or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than <b>methane.</b> Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.

5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of <b>methane).</b> Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of <b>methane,</b> many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of <b>methane</b> in such environments and can play a role as primary producers.
