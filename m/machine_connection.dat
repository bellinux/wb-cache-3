40|$|Mobile cloud {{computing}} (MCC) is just {{cloud computing}} in {{which at least}} some of the devices like mobiles, PDA etc are involved. This paper drives over several authentication techniques and methods for mobile cloud computing. An analysis of the existing works are carried out. This Paper also analyses the attacks and Issues that occur during authentication in the mobile cloud environment. Security is the main issue that obstructs cloud from being widely adopted. A framework called the Mobile Cloud Authenticator (MCA) is proposed for authenticating the mobile users in the mobile cloud environment. The overall framework of MCA consists of three major entities namely, Cloud users, Mobile network and Cloud. There is a system called Unified Cloud Authenticator (UCA) which is placed in between the mobile network and Cloud Service Provider (CSP). It authenticates both users and CSP. The UCA contains Authentication Server (AS), hashing <b>machine,</b> <b>connection</b> manager, user manager and service manager. The operational procedure of UCA has three phases namely registration phase, authentication phase and verification phase.

40|$|<b>Connection</b> <b>Machine</b> Lisp is a dialect of Lisp {{extended}} to al-low a fine. grained, data-oriented style of parallel execution. We {{introduce a new}} data structure, the xapping, that is like a sparse array whose elements can be processed in parallel. This kind of processing is suitable for implementation by such fine-grained parallel computers as the <b>Connection</b> <b>Machine</b> System and NON-VON. Additional program notation is introduced to indicate var-ious parallel operations. The symbols st and • are used, in a manner syntactically reminiscent of the backquote notation used in Common Lisp, to indicate what parts of an expression are to be executed in parallel. Ths symbol fl is used to indicate permu-tation and reduction of sets of data. <b>Connection</b> <b>Machine</b> Lisp in practice leans heavily on APL and FP and their descendants. Many ideas and stylistic idioms can be carried over directly. Some idioms of <b>Connection</b> <b>Machine</b> Lisp are difficult to render in APL because <b>Connection</b> <b>Machine</b> Lisp xappings may be sparse while APL vectors are not sparse.

The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups-visible units and hidden units. General Boltzmann <b>machines</b> allow <b>connection</b> between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine.
