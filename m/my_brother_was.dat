500|$|Chinese {{was taught}} to Murasaki's brother as {{preparation}} {{for a career in}} government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>brother...</b> <b>was</b> a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that [...] "Women... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." [...] Murasaki was aware that others saw her as [...] "pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had [...] "a forceful personality that seldom won her friends".|$|E
500|$|Late in the afternoon, {{after hours}} of fighting, Wilson's men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other's hands and singing a song, {{possibly}} [...] "God Save the Queen". The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears. Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide. According to an eyewitness, [...] "the white inDuna" [...] (Wilson) {{was the last to}} die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body. After a few moments of hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai. The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: [...] "The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others," [...] an inDuna explained. At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome. [...] "I had two sons killed that day," [...] Ingubo warrior M'Kotchwana later said, [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> shot in the stomach. The amakiwa [...] were brave men; they were warriors." ...|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was born}} on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both {{physicians}} in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi from Ambala. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, {{a former member of}} Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra and Mannara Chopra are her cousins. Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, [...] "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race {{up to the top of}} the stupa". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.|$|E

Writer Ronin Ro maintained, “They no longer resembled gospel singers… Puffy also {{asked them to}} build their mystique by posing for photos with {{their backs to the}} camera, which he borrowed from Guy’s stage show.” The album’s seductive energy showcased DeVante’s songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..." [...] The album went on to sell over three million copies.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he started}} his {{university}} studies, Boas first attended Heidelberg University for a semester followed by four terms at Bonn University, studying physics, geography, and mathematics at these schools. [...] In 1879, he hoped to transfer to Berlin University to study physics under Hermann von Helmholtz, but ended up transferring to the University of Kiel instead due to family reasons. [...] At Kiel, Boas studied under Theobald Fischer and received a doctorate in physics in 1881 for his dissertation entitled [...] "Contributions to the Understanding of the Color of Water," [...] which examined the absorption, reflection, and the polarization of light in seawater. [...] Although technically Boas' doctorate degree was in physics, his advisor Fischer, a student of Carl Ritter, was primarily a geographer and thus some biographers view Boas {{as more of a}} geographer than a physicist at this stage. [...] The combination of physics and geography also may have been accomplished through a major in physics and a minor in geography. [...] For his part Boas self-identified as a geographer by this time, prompting his sister, Toni, to write in 1883 [...] "After long years of infidelity, <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> re-conquered by geography, the first love of his boyhood." ...|$|E
