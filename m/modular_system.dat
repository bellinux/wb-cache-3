5|$|<b>Modular</b> <b>system</b> of architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although {{other texts}} preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai fen system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest and grade VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai fen grade was employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen fen (hence the title of this <b>modular</b> <b>system).</b>|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a <b>modular</b> <b>system,</b> where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E

25|$|A {{backplate}} and wing {{is a type}} of scuba harness with an attached buoyancy compensation device (BCD) which establishes {{neutral buoyancy}} underwater and positive buoyancy on the surface. Unlike most BCDs, the backplate and wing is a <b>modular</b> <b>system,</b> in that it consists of separable components. The core components of this system are the backplate, usually made from metal, which is held against the diver’s back by the harness, and to which the diver’s primary cylinder or cylinders are attached, and inflatable buoyancy bladder known as a wing, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder(s), used for adjusting the buoyancy of the diver when in the water. This arrangement clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit.|$|E
25|$|At {{the highest}} level, the design may be {{optimized}} to make {{best use of}} the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, {{a system that is}} network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though it takes longer itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> may allow rewrite of only some component – for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at the design level, and may be difficult to change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).|$|E
500|$|The {{company has}} since {{released}} the XK-3, a single-manual organ {{using the same}} digital tonewheel technology as the New B-3. The XK-3 {{is part of a}} <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> that allows an integrated lower manual and pedals to be added. In response to some clones, including a variety of vintage keyboards in a single package, Hammond released the SK series of organs, which include grand piano, Rhodes piano, Wurlitzer electronic piano, Hohner clavinet, and samples of wind and brass instruments alongside the standard drawbar and tonewheel emulation. Keyboard Magazine Stephen Fortner praised the single manual SK1, indicated that it gave an accurate sound throughout the range of drawbar settings, and said the organ sound was [...] "fat, warm, utterly authentic". The XK-1c model was introduced in early 2014, which is simply an organ-only version of the SK1. An updated flagship organ, the XK-5, was launched in 2016.|$|E
