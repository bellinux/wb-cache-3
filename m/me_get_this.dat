Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E

If I didn't 'pet'--if I didn't mush, if I didn't park my corsets at dances--if I didn't drink and smoke, and wiggle like a jelly-fish, I'd be a dead one--an egg, and don't you overlook that. If any one says I want to do these things he's a fool. But I do love to have good times, and little by little I've been drawn on and on.... I've had my troubles staving off these fellows. Most of them get half drunk. Some of the girls do, too. I never went that far. I always kept my head. I never went the limit. But you can bet your sweet life it wasn't their fault I didn't fall for them.... I'll say I've had to walk home from more than one auto ride. There's something in the gag, 'I know she's a good girl because I met her walking home from an auto ride.' That's one thing I intend to cut out this summer--the auto rides. Nothing doing for little Flossie!" ...|$|E

40|$|I thank {{everyone}} for {{the opportunity}} to work on the research project that led to this thesis. ASHRAE’s new cooling load procedures were an extremely interesting topic. The knowledge gained working to construct the facility to validate the procedures will serve me well professionally, and through life in general. Even in my new professional life the papers generated by this research have generated conversations at local engineering events. I hope that the test facility will live on, not in infamy, but as a useful tool for future research projects in the MAE department.

I also want to thank Dr. Rees and Dr. Spitler, Chanvit and Calvin, Dustin, Brett, Sam, Sean and the other graduate students.

Second, I would like to recognize the significant research assistance provided by Mary Cargill. It never ceases to amaze me how much critical material can be overlooked by those of us who are not librarians or archivists.

40|$|Style Manual) Homophobic {{attitudes and}} discriminatory actions are {{problematic}} issues that schools {{are confronted with}} on a daily basis. Students that {{are believed to be}} homosexual are verbally assaulted and sometimes physically abused. Similar actions are taken against students whose parents or siblings are gay. The entire school community, consisting of teachers, students, parents, administrators, and counselors, may all be involved in the continuation of homophobia in the school. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate strategies and resources schools utilize to prevent or reduce homophobia in Wisconsin schools. The investigator conducted a structured phone interview with a limited sample of high school and middle school counselors throughout Wisconsin to determine what action schools take to enforce the freedom of sexual orientation. ii The findings of this study illustrated prevention and intervention strategies school districts use to combat homophobia. These strategies were examined at both the high school and middle school levels. School districts may use this information to adapt or improve their own systems. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Dutch Van Den Heuvel, my research advisor, for steering me in the right direction and helping <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> thesis finished in a timely manner.
