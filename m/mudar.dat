5|$|Al-Rahba {{came under}} Hamdanid rule {{a few years}} later, {{becoming}} part of the Euphrates district (tariq al-Furat) of the Mosul-based emirate. At the time, the town was described by the Persian geographer al-Istakhri, as being larger than the ancient Circesium {{on the opposite side of}} the Euphrates. The lord of al-Rahba, Jaman, rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla (r. 929–967). Jaman fled the town and drowned in the Euphrates but not before al-Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion's suppression. Nasir al-Dawla granted his favored son, Abu'l Muzzafar Hamdan, control of al-Rahba, its district of Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> and the district's revenues.|$|E
5|$|The young Ali ibn Abdallah {{began his}} career under his brother. In 936, Hasan invited his younger brother to his service, {{promising}} him the governorship of Diyar Bakr (the region around Amida) {{in exchange for his}} help against Ali ibn Ja'far, the rebellious governor of Mayyafariqin. Ali ibn Abdallah was successful in preventing Ibn Ja'far from receiving the assistance of his Armenian allies, and also secured control over the northern parts of the neighbouring province of Diyar <b>Mudar</b> after subduing the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj. From this position, he also launched expeditions to aid the Muslim emirates of the Byzantine frontier zone (the Thughur) against the advancing Byzantines, and intervened in Armenia to reverse growing Byzantine influence (see below).|$|E
5|$|In October–November 938, Bajkam and the Caliph campaigned {{against the}} {{influential}} Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{who had taken}} advantage of the turmoil in Iraq to cease forwarding his province's revenue to Baghdad. Although Bajkam's army captured Mosul, Hasan fled before him to the remotest corners of his domain, where Bajkam's forces pursued him in vain. In the meantime, the local population resented the presence of the caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them, while Ibn Ra'iq used Bajkam's absence to take control of Baghdad {{at the head of a}} Carmathian force. These developments forced Bajkam to negotiate with his rivals: the Hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for the payment of the tax arrears, and Ibn Ra'iq was bought off with the governorship of the provinces of Tariq al-Furat, Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> Qinnasrin and al-'Awasim, which were also claimed by the Ikhshidids of Egypt. This arrangement allowed Bajkam and the Caliph to return to Baghdad in February 939.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid was unable, however, {{to restore}} {{effective}} caliphal control {{north of the}} Jazira in Transcaucasia, where Armenia and Adharbayjan remained {{in the hands of}} virtually independent local dynasties. Ibn Abu'l-Saj, who was now the caliphal governor of Adharbayjan, proclaimed himself independent around 898, although soon he recognized again the Caliph's suzerainty during his conflicts with the Christian Armenian princes. When he died in 901, he was succeeded by his son Devdad, marking the consolidation of the semi-independent Sajid dynasty in the region. In 900 Ibn Abu'l-Saj was even suspected of plotting to seize the Diyar <b>Mudar</b> province with the co-operation of the notables of Tarsus, after which the vengeful Caliph ordered the latter arrested and the city's fleet burned. This decision was a self-inflicted wound on the centuries-long war against Byzantium; in recent decades the Tarsians and their fleet had {{played a major role in}} the raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces. While a Syrian fleet under the renegade Damian of Tarsus sacked the port of Demetrias around 900, and Arab fleets would go on to wreak havoc in the Aegean Sea over the next two decades, the Byzantines were strengthened on land by an influx of Armenian refugees, such as Melias. The Byzantines began to expand their control over the border regions, scoring victories and founding new provinces (themes) in the former no-man's land between the two empires.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to Hasan's rule {{outside of}} his family's core region around Mosul remained, however—in Diyar Bakr, the {{governor}} of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be {{explained by the fact that}} a significant portion of the tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E
25|$|Tantawy's {{decision}} {{stems from}} his views that younger Muslims have {{lost touch with}} traditional Islamic scholarship and have come {{under the influence of}} imams from the Salafi (Wahhabi) branch in Saudi Arabia. Islamic Sharia law, according to certain public pundits (e.g., <b>Mudar</b> Zahran) and Islamic scholars, in fact bans women from wearing the niqab in Mecca during worship.|$|E
25|$|In 942, Banu Numayr tribesmen {{served as}} {{auxiliary}} troops for an Abbasid governor in Upper Mesopotamia. Six years later, they {{were employed in}} the same fashion by Sayf ad-Dawla (r. 945–967), the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, against incursions by the Ikhshidid leader Abu al-Misk Kafur. Not long after, Sayf attempted to check the Bedouin tribes, whose growing strength came {{at the expense of the}} settled population. Thus, the Banu Numayr were driven out of Diyar <b>Mudar</b> and took refuge in Jabal Sinjar in Diyar Rabi'a to the east. Along with other Qaysi tribes, the Banu Numayr revolted against Sayf and the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla. The latter expelled them to the Syrian Desert, while in 955/56, Sayf gained their submission, after which he confined them to an area near the Khabur River in Diyar <b>Mudar.</b> By 957, Sayf launched another expedition against the Banu Numayr, who proved to be unruly subjects.|$|E
25|$|When Sayf died in 967, his Aleppo-based emirate (principality) {{entered a}} period of {{administrative}} decline. This hampered the Hamdanids' ability to effectively control the southeastern areas of Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> near the hostile Byzantine frontier, necessitating further reliance on the Banu Numayr. To that end, Sayf's successor, Sa'd ad-Dawla, assigned members of the tribe to governorships {{in cities such as}} Harran, to which he appointed an emir of the Banu Numayr, Wathhab ibn Sabiq. In 990, the latter rebelled against the Hamdanids and declared an independent emirate in Harran. This event marked the establishment of the Numayrid dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The Numayrids {{ruled the}} Diyar <b>Mudar</b> region (western Upper Mesopotamia), {{controlling}} the lands between Harran, Saruj and Raqqa {{more or less}} continuously between 990 and 1081. For much of this time, they were bordered {{to the south and}} west by the Aleppo-based Mirdasid Emirate, to the east by the Mosul-based Uqaylid Emirate, to the north by the Mayyafariqin-based Marwanid Emirate and to the northwest by the Byzantine Empire. The Numayrids, Mirdasids and Uqaylids were Arab dynasties and the Marwanids were Kurds. All were independent, petty dynasties that emerged in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia in the late 10th–early 11th centuries due to the inability of the great regional powers i.e. the Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate, the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantines, to control or annex these regions. At different times, the Numayrids paid allegiance and formed loose alliances with all three powers.|$|E
25|$|The Numayrids were an Arab dynasty {{based in}} Diyar <b>Mudar</b> (western Upper Mesopotamia). They were emirs (princes) of their namesake tribe, the Banu Numayr. The senior {{branch of the}} dynasty, founded by Waththab ibn Sabiq in 990, more or less {{continuously}} ruled the Euphrates cities of Harran, Saruj and Raqqa until the late 11th century. In {{the early part of}} Waththab's reign (990–1019), the Numayrids also seized Edessa, until the Byzantines conquered it in the early 1030s. In 1062, the Numayrids lost Raqqa to their distant kinsmen and erstwhile allies, the Mirdasids, while by 1081, their capital Harran and nearby Saruj were conquered by the Turkish Seljuks and their Arab Uqaylid allies. Numayrid emirs continued to hold isolated fortresses in Upper Mesopotamia, such as Qal'at an-Najm and Sinn Ibn Utayr near Samosata until the early 12th century, but nothing is heard of them after 1120.|$|E
25|$|Terms between Shabib and the Byzantines were {{reached in}} 1032 and during {{delineation}} of borders, Edessa {{was left in}} Byzantine territory, {{while the rest of}} Diyar <b>Mudar</b> remained under Numayrid rule. For an undetermined period afterward, Shabib paid tribute to the Byzantines. Because he was unable to effectively challenge the Byzantines, Shabib focused on expanding his domain eastward and northward into Marwanid and Uqaylid territory. In 1033, he assaulted Uqaylid-held Nisibin, but was repelled. The following year he gained Byzantine military backing and advanced against Amid, the Marwanid capital. He retreated after a show of strength by a Marwanid–Uqaylid coalition. Also in 1033/34, the city of Harran was restored to Shabib, one year after an uprising involving local peasants and ahdath (urban militiamen) which apparently targeted the Sabian community. The uprising came at the heel of a severe famine and plague affecting the city. By 1036, Shabib and Ibn Utayr defected from the Byzantines and joined the Marwanid–Uqaylid effort to expel the Byzantines from Edessa. The Numayrids captured and looted the city, took several men captive and killed many of the inhabitants. However, they did not seize the citadel and Shabib hastily withdrew to confront a Seljuq threat to Harran. Shabib and the Byzantines made peace in 1037 and Edessa was confirmed as a Byzantine possession.|$|E
25|$|Abu Firas soon {{distinguished}} himself {{both for}} his martial {{as well as}} for his literary ability, and in 947/8, when he was only 16, Sayf al-Dawla appointed him governor of Manbij, close to the border with the Byzantine Empire, to which the governorship of Harran was later added. Despite his youth, he distinguished himself both in the conflicts with the Nizari tribes of the Diyar <b>Mudar</b> and the Syrian desert, as well as in his cousin's frequent raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory. Thus, in 952, he defeated the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas the Younger or his son Constantine Phokas, when the latter tried to interfere with Sayf al-Dawla's refortification of the towns of Ra'ban and Mar'ash in the frontier zone. His captivity by the Byzantines is variously dated by the Arabic sources. According to Ibn Khallikan, he was first captured by the Byzantines in 959, but escaped captivity at the fortress of Kharshana by jumping into the Euphrates; this tale is however dismissed by some modern commentators. Most sources place his capture in 962 (in November, according to Ibn al-Athir). The Byzantine general Theodore Parsakoutenos led a raid of 1,000 or 1,300 men in the vicinity of Manbij, and when Abu Firas set out with only seventy men to obstruct their plundering, he was captured. According to Ibn Shaddad, however, who reports the story with slight differences, this event took place in 959/60.|$|E
25|$|Jordan {{participated in}} the {{imposition}} of economic sanctions against Iraq even though the sanctions would severely affect its economy. The effects of the Gulf War, the sanctions on Iraq, and the flow of refugees to Jordan were estimated by a UN report to be $1.5billion out of a gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.2billion in 1990, and $3.6billion out of a GDP of $4.7billion in 1991. The end of the Gulf War coincided {{with the end of}} the Cold War. This allowed the United States to play a more active role in solving the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Bush administration were still angry at Hussein for the Gulf War events but realized they needed Jordan's participation in any peace process. Hussein agreed to an American request to join an international peace conference so that Jordan could start repairing its relationship with the United States, and end its political isolation. Hussein's moves towards democratization 1989 and his stance during the 1990 Gulf War had won him considerable popularity across Jordan's political spectrum. But when Hussein replaced his conservative prime minister, <b>Mudar</b> Badran, with liberal Palestinian Taher Al-Masri, who was in favor of peace negotiations with Israel, the Muslim BrotherhoodJordan's main opposition group, who at that time occupied 22 out of 80 seats in the House of Representatives, and whose members and support came mostly from Palestinians in the countryvehemently rejected the new prime minister by voting against him during the vote of confidence. The Brotherhood also refused to participate in the National Congress where the King hoped to gather support for a peace settlement.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} 977 that Sa'd al-Dawla managed to regain his capital, which by now was {{under the control of}} Bakjur, who in 975 had deposed and imprisoned Qarquya. Aided by some of his father's ghilman, and, crucially, the {{powerful}} Banu Kilab tribe living around Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla besieged Aleppo and captured it. Qarquya was set free and again entrusted with the affairs of state until his death a few years later, while Bakjur was given the governorship of Homs. Soon after, in 979, he was able to capitalize upon Abu Taghlib's conflict with the Buyids of Iraq to recover some of his father's domains in the Jazira: after acknowledging Buyid suzerainty, he received governorship of the Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> except for Raqqa and Rahba. At the same time, he also received from the Abbasid Caliph—who was a puppet of the Buyids—the honorific laqab by which he is known.|$|E
500|$|This policy became {{immediately}} {{evident in}} the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal, the Tulunids: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and a further 200,000 dinars in arrears, {{as well as the}} return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar <b>Mudar.</b> To seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a [...] "wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history" [...] (Thierry Bianquis). Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. According to a story, after a thorough search, al-Mu'tadid's chief eunuch could only find five ornate silver-and-gold candlesticks to decorate the palace, while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick. Thereupon al-Mu'tadid is said to have remarked [...] "come let us go and hide ourselves, lest we be seen in our poverty".|$|E
500|$|Sa'd al-Dawla reached Aleppo, {{which for}} {{years had been}} governed by Sayf al-Dawla's chief {{minister}} and chamberlain (hajib), Qarquya, in June/July 967. Almost immediately he was confronted by a rebellion of his uncle, Abu Firas, at the time governor of Homs, which lasted until the latter's death in battle in April 968. At the same time, Aleppo itself was threatened by the Byzantines, and Sa'd al-Dawla, {{on the advice of}} Qarquya, left the city. The Byzantines did not attack the city, but Qarquya and his fellow ghilman (military slaves) seized the moment to claim the city for themselves. Accompanied by 300 faithful followers, Sa'd al-Dawla was thus reduced to wandering from city to city across the lands that were nominally his, hoping to gain entry: Saruj, Manbij and Harran refused to support him, while at Mayyafariqin his own mother refused to let him in. Finally, he found refuge at Homs. In the meantime, many of his father's old supporters left to join his cousin Abu Taghlib, Emir of Mosul, who used the opportunity to expand his own territory. Immediately after Sayf al-Dawla's death, he captured Raqqa, and by 971 extended his control over the provinces of Diyar Bakr and Diyar <b>Mudar.</b> Sa'd al-Dawla, unable to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty.|$|E
500|$|Abu Taghlib, surnamed al-Ghadanfar ("The Lion"), succeeded {{his father}} as emir {{and head of the}} Jaziran branch of the Hamdanid family, but almost {{immediately}} his authority was contested by a younger half-brother, Hamdan. Nasir al-Dawla had entrusted the latter with the governance of Nisibis, Maridin and Rahba shortly before his deposition, and may have intended to name him as his heir over Abu Taghlib. Hamdan was indeed the only son of Nasir al-Dawla to protest his father's deposition, and refused to recognize Abu Taghlib. With the aid of the new Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, Abu Taghlib prevailed over Hamdan, who fled to Baghdad. In addition, Abu Taghlib used the conditions of near-anarchy prevailing in Syria at the time and after Sayf al-Dawla's death to expand his territory at the expense of his cousin, Sa'd al-Dawla. Upon Sayf al-Dawla's death, Abu Taghlib [...] seized Raqqa and Rafiqa, and by 971 he had extended his control over all of Diyar Bakr and Diyar <b>Mudar,</b> once part of Sayf al-Dawla's domain, uniting the entire Jazira under his rule. Sa'd al-Dawla, deprived of his own capital and lacking any power to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty. As ruler of the Jazira, Abu Taghlib was one of the richest rulers of the region; Ibn Hawkal's descriptions attest to the wealth derived from the many Hamdanid estates, and Ibn Miskawayh, who was tasked with inventorying the family's mountain strongholds after the Buyid dissolution of the Hamdanid emirate in 979, writes of the immense cash reserves stored there.|$|E
500|$|At Ibn Tulun's death, Khumarawayh, {{with the}} backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded without opposition. Ibn Tulun bequeathed his heir [...] "with a {{seasoned}} military, a stable economy, and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats". Khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against the Abbasid attempt to overthrow him at the Battle of Tawahin and even made additional territorial gains, but his extravagant spending exhausted the treasury, and his assassination in 896 began the rapid decline of the Tulunid regime. Internal strife sapped Tulunid power. Khumarawayh's son Jaysh was a drunkard who executed his uncle, <b>Mudar</b> ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun; he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother Harun ibn Khumarawayh. Harun too was a weak ruler, and although a revolt by his uncle Rabi'ah in Alexandria was suppressed, the Tulunids were unable to confront the attacks of the Qarmatians who began at the same time. In addition, many commanders defected to the Abbasids, whose power revived under the capable leadership of al-Muwaffaq's son, Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892–902). Finally, in December 904, two other sons of Ibn Tulun, Ali and Shayban, murdered their nephew and assumed control of the Tulunid state. Far from halting the decline, this event alienated key commanders in Syria and led to the rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of Syria and Egypt by the Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who entered Fustat in January 905. With the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the victorious Abbasid troops pillaged al-Qata'i and razed it to the ground.|$|E

2500|$|Nasr fought {{alongside}} his father, [...] but escaped al-Uqhuwanah {{and returned to}} Aleppo, where his younger brother, Thimal, had been left to administer affairs in his father's absence. It {{is evidenced by the}} two surviving coins minted during Salih's reign that Thimal had been designated as Salih's walī al-ʿahd (chosen successor) as late as 1028/29, the year before Salih's death. However, in the aftermath of al-Uqhuwanah, Nasr and Thimal apparently ruled Aleppo jointly, with Nasr based in the city and Thimal in the citadel. In the aftermath of their defeat at al-Uqhuwanah, the Mirdasids lost Sidon, Baalbek, Hims, Hisn Ibn Akkar and Rafaniyya, and concentrated their forces in Jund Qinnasrin and western Diyar <b>Mudar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, those {{adjectives}} {{were not}} always derived from the corresponding Portuguese verbs. Most of them were directly derived from the accusatives of the present participles of Latin verbs, a form which was not retained by Portuguese. Thus, for example, Portuguese mutante ("changing", [...] "varying") does not derive from the Portuguese verb <b>mudar</b> ("to change"), but directly from the Latin accusative present participle mutantem ("changing"). On the other hand, those pairs of words were eventually generalized by Portuguese speakers into a derivational rule, that is somewhat irregular and defective but still productive. So, for example, within the last 500 years we had the derivation pï'poka (Tupi for [...] "to pop the skin") → pipoca (Portuguese for [...] "popcorn") → pipocar ("to pop up all over") → pipocante ("popping up all over").|$|E
2500|$|On 16 July, Israeli forces {{dropped by}} means of leaflets, {{loudspeaker}} announcements, telephone calls, text messages and radio messages, told the residents to leave and relocate in central Gaza City until further notice.

By 19 July, OCHA reported that while the majority had not left their homes,and ignored the warnings, up to half had gone as bombardments intensified. Israel condemned Hamas for using [...] "human shields". According to Amnesty International, the UNRWA shelter facilities were overflowing and many of the residents had nowhere to go. Residents interviewed later also cited confusion due of lack of electricity and communications. The official Israeli view was that Hamas had compelled residents of Shujai'iya to stay behind in the face of IDF warnings to evacuate prior to the IDF assault, holding civilians as [...] "hostages".

2500|$|The {{accession}} of al-Mu'tadid in 892 {{brought a}} warming {{of relations with}} the Baghdad court; recognizing {{that he could not}} defeat the Tulunids, the new Caliph instead opted to conciliate them: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous governor over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and further 200,000 dinars in arrears, as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar <b>Mudar.</b> In addition, the prestigious tiraz factories in Alexandria and Fustat, which produced government banners and robes, remained under caliphal control. In order to seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court.

2500|$|The most {{enduring}} legacy of Marj Rahit was {{the consolidation of}} the Qays–Kalb split in Syria, which was paralleled in the division and rivalry between the <b>Mudar,</b> led by the Banu Tamim, and the Rabi'a and Azd alliance in Iraq. Together, these rivalries caused a realignment of tribal loyalties into two tribal confederations or [...] "super-groups" [...] across the Caliphate: the [...] "North Arab" [...] or Qays/Mudar block, opposed by the [...] "South Arabs" [...] or Yemenis, although these terms were political rather than strictly geographical, since the properly [...] "northern" [...] Rabi'a adhered to the [...] "southern" [...] Yemenis. The Umayyad caliphs tried to maintain {{a balance between the}} two groups, but this division and the implacable rivalry between the two groups became a fixture of the Arab world over the next decades, as even originally unaligned tribes were drawn to affiliate themselves with one of the two super-groups. Their constant contest for power and influence dominated the Umayyad Caliphate, creating instability in the provinces, helping to foment the disastrous Third Islamic Civil War and contributing to the Umayyads' final fall {{at the hands of the}} Abbasids. The division continued long after: as Hugh N. Kennedy writes, [...] "As late as the nineteenth century, battles were still being fought in Palestine between groups calling themselves Qays and Yaman".|$|E

Indeed the rarity of the genus (except F. infectoria) in the native woods of these hills, is very remarkable. The banyan and peepul always appear to be planted, as do the tamarind and mango.|$|E
