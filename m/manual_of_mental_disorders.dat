5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology.

5|$|Lorna Wing popularized {{the term}} Asperger {{syndrome}} in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 {{publication of a}} series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-IV).|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear.

In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E

The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

Hierarchical multiple regression accounted for age, gender, housing status, and involvement in gambling before considering relationships between consumer preferences and scores on the Problem Gambling Severity Index.

Method: Hierarchal regression analysis was used to assess whether significant relationships between mindfulness and hypersexuality exist beyond associations commonly found with emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and stress proneness {{in a sample of}} male hypersexual patients (n = 40) and control subjects (n = 30). Results: Our results show a robust inverse relationship of mindfulness to hypersexuality over and above associations with emotional regulation, impulsivity, and stress proneness.

40|$|ObjectiveaaPsychiatric {{disorders}} such as depression, {{anxiety and}} alcohol dependence are associated with serotonin metabolism. We assessed the methylation level of the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) promoter region in control and alcohol dependent patients. MethodsaaTwenty seven male patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> IV (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence were compared with fifteen controls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of bisulfate-modified DNA were designed to amplify {{a part of the}} CpG island in the 5 HTT gene. Pyrosequencing was performed and the methylation level at seven CpG island sites was measured. ResultsaaWe found no differences in the methylation patterns of the serotonin transporter linked promoter region (5 -HTTLPR) between alcohol-dependent and control subjects. ConclusionaaOur negative finding may be because 5 -HTT epigenetic variation may not affect the expression for 5 -HTT or there may be other methylation site critical for its expression. To find out more conclusive result, repeating the study in more methylation sites with a larger number of samples in a well-controlled setting is needed. Psychiatry Investig 2011; 8 : 130 - 13...|$|R

5000|$|The 4th {{edition of}} the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> (DSM-IV) had a Nicotine Dependence {{diagnosis}} that went beyond physical dependence to include, “…a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms ….” In the updated DSM-V there is no nicotine dependence diagnosis, but rather Tobacco Use Disorder, which is defined as, “A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least 2 of the following symptoms, occurring within a 12-month period.” Some of these 11 symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal, craving, inability to quit or cut down, and use despite problems. In other words, the indicators of dependence. These symptoms are consistent with other Substance Use Disorder diagnoses for other drugs. However, {{it is important to}} note that for nicotine dependence, it is impaired control or the inability to quit despite the known health risks of tobacco use that is the central feature of this definition. It should also be noted that while a DSM diagnosis is dichotomous, the cut-off of 2 of 11 symptoms is somewhat arbitrary.|$|R
40|$|Background: Lack {{of insight}} in {{patients}} with bipolar I disorder {{has been associated with}} poor course and clinical outcome and compromised therapeutic compliance. Therefore, it is important to evaluate insight and use more specialized scales such as Mood Disorder Insight Scale (MDIS) in these patients. Our objective in this study was to assess validity and reliability of Persian version of MDIS. Materials and Methods: A hundred forty five bipolar patients were selected from Iran Hospital of Psychiatry. They were interviewed by The Persian Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder,</b> 4 th edition′s (DSM-IV) axis I disorders (SCID-I) and the Scale to Assess Unawareness <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> (SUMD).

The test-retest reliability (coefficient alpha) was 0. 95 (p < 0. 01). Construct validity and concurrent validity were supported by factor analysis and Spearman rank correlation between MDIS and SUMD (0. 85). Conclusions: Persian version of the MDIS could be a useful instrument for assessing insight {{in patients with}} bipolar I disorder...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{goals of}} this study were to {{investigate}} whether depression is associated with cellular immunity in ambulatory patients and to identify neuroendocrine and behavioral pathways that might account for this relation- ship. Methods: We studied 32 women who met Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder,</b> fourth edition, criteria for major depressive disorder and 32 healthy female control subjects. The groups were matched for age and ethnicity. None were taking medication, and all were free of disease involving the immune system. Results: Depressed subjects had reduced proliferative responses to the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemag- glutinin compared with control subjects. Natural killer cell activity was reduced among older depressed subjects but enhanced among younger depressed subjects. Although	depression was associated with	elevated circulating	levels of norepinephrine and estradiol, these hormones could not account for the immunologic differences between depressed and control subjects. Depression was also associated with greater tobacco and caffeine consumption, less physical activity, and poorer sleep quality. Mediational analyses were consistent with physical activity acting as a pathway through which depression was associated with reduced lymphocyte proliferation. Conclusions: Ambula- tory patients with mild to moderately severe depression exhibit reduced mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte prolifer- ative responses and altered natural killer cell cytotoxicity. The relationship between depression and proliferative responses may be mediated by physical activity...|$|R
