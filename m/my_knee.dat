500|$|What I went through, only I {{will ever}} know. <b>My</b> <b>knee</b> cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. It is such a figure of fun." [...] The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. [...] "I think it should make a good book," [...] she wrote, [...] "When I have learnt to draw the child." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mudge missed {{much of the}} 2005 season, first recuperating from an {{operation}} to rehabilitate a damaged knee which left her on crutches, and then succumbing to a bout of plantar fasciitis between May and July. Of her surgery, Mudge said: [...] "I'd worn away all <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> cartilage – {{more to do with}} my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my femur, so the surgeon drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, I could run again. <b>My</b> <b>knee</b> was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a physiotherapist told me there were lots of people for whom the operation did not work." ...|$|E

Coppell {{was the victim}} of a vicious high challenge from József Tóth which shattered his knee. Coppell said the effect was [...] "like someone had put a firework in <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> and it had gone off" [...] and underwent an operation which allowed him a temporary fix so he could carry on playing.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree" [...] ("Under the {{spreading}} chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me") {{was based on}} an old English song called [...] "Go no more a-rushing" [...] ("Under {{the spreading}} chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing [...] "chest", and touching your head when you sing [...] "nut"). Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into <b>my</b> <b>knee.</b> The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E
2500|$|Hrithik Roshan {{elaborated}} on {{his character}} {{saying that he}} was [...] ".. a super character in the film. I have interacted with about 20 such patients who suffer from complete paralysis of {{the lower half of the}} body, including both legs which is mostly caused by damage of the spinal cord. They are real life superheroes and I am representing their emotions on screen". Adding that he never had felt such responsibility towards any other character he had played to date, he told the media that the film did not take any stance on mercy-killing. Roshan said that he was able to identify with Ethan Mascarenhas because, when he was going through the Guzaarish script, he had been nursing a knee problem and doctors told him that the knee will never be okay. According to Roshan, the script [...] "..energised me so much that I was not depressed about <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> problem anymore".|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, the {{decorative}} arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., [...] "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," [...] was jointly created by William Morris, Madox Brown, Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home. Jane Morris directed the embroidery arm, and Georgiana was employed painting tiles, but {{with the birth of}} her son Philip in October of that year she gave up the art studio to become a full-time caregiver. [...] "I remember the feeling of exile with which I now heard through its closed door the well-known voices of friends together with Edward's familiar laugh, while I sat with my little son on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> and dropped selfish tears on him as 'separator of companions and the terminator of delights'". [...] As late as 1868 she was still attempting to learn to etch but none of her work was published.|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, {{upon hearing}} {{of the death of}} his brother, Warwick vows, [...] "Here on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> I vow to God above/I'll never pause again, never stand still,/Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine/Or fortune given me measure of revenge" [...] (2.3.29–32). During his time in France, Warwick again cites revenge as part of his reason for joining the Lancastrians; [...] "Did I let pass th'abuse done to my niece?" [...] (3.3.188 – this is a {{reference}} to an incident reported in both Hall and Holinshed where Edward attempted to rape either Warwick's daughter or his niece; [...] "Edward did attempt a thing once in the Earl's house which was much against the Earl's honesty (whether he would have deflowered his daughter or his niece, the certainty was not for both their honours openly known) for surely such a thing was attempted by King Edward"); Holinshed (1587: Rrriiv)). Only a few lines later, Warwick then exclaims, [...] "I will revenge [...] wrong to Lady Bona" [...] (3.3.197). He also acknowledges that revenge is his primary motive in joining the Lancastrians, not devotion to their cause; [...] "I'll be the chief to bring [...] down again,/Not that I pity Henry's misery,/But seek revenge on Edward's mockery" [...] (3.3.264–266). Indeed, it is perhaps Warwick who sums up the revenge ethic of the play; in Act 2, Scene 6, upon finding Clifford's body, Warwick orders that Clifford's head replace York's at the gates of the city, declaring [...] "Measure for measure must be answer'd" [...] (l.54).|$|E

2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
