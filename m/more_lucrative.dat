5|$|Beverley {{inherited}} a large estate after his father's death in 1722, and continued speculating in land. He received income from tobacco production and rent from tenant farmers. Although by 1745 Beverley's estate produced 57 hogsheads (about 26,000kg) of tobacco, the income from his 119 tenants in Caroline, Culpeper, Orange and King and Queen Counties was far <b>more</b> <b>lucrative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Balfour estate {{sold its}} farms on Shapinsay between 1924 and 1928. This {{was a common}} {{occurrence}} in Orkney {{at the time as}} wealthy landowners moved to <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> forms of investment. Farms were generally sold to the sitting tenant or to their neighbours who wished to expand.|$|E
5|$|With {{their record}} deal with Island Records {{coming to an}} end, the band signed a <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> {{extension}} in 1984. They negotiated {{the return of the}} copyrights of their songs, an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.|$|E

50|$|The Foundation funded {{postdoctoral}} fellowships at four New York {{biomedical research}} centers, {{beginning in the}} early 1980s. Aimed at young scientists, the fellowships enabled them to enter research careers instead of private practice or industry, which would otherwise seem <b>more</b> immediately <b>lucrative.</b> The programs also fund specific institutions and identify priorities for research.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Abayomi-Cole's herbal {{practice}} became <b>more</b> {{popular and}} <b>lucrative</b> {{than those of}} medical practitioners who had studied orthodox medicine in Britain, and he became a scientific and medical adviser to Governor Sir Leslie Probyn.|$|R
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was <b>more</b> <b>lucrative.</b> Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E
5|$|The player {{plays the}} role of Buck Mann, a space runner down on his luck. A former {{military}} pilot and racer, Buck begins to accept jobs from large corporations when his money runs out. Accompanied by the android, Adaam-12, he first accepts a job from the Big Cargo corporation carrying simple cargo containers. Shortly afterwards, the Nuclear Star corporation approaches him to carry nuclear waste. After several runs, Buck Mann attracts the attention of the pirates Brown Beard and Captain Black, who continuously harass him as his missions become more and <b>more</b> <b>lucrative.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} controversy regarding Holden's decision {{to retain the}} Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, lacking a V8 engine option and switching from a RWD to a FWD drivetrain. Whilst the decision has been {{considered to be a}} safe choice in order to preserve sales, the retention of the Commodore name has been critiqued for Holden missing the opportunity to rebrand its sedan range and push its offering into the <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> semi-premium end of the market.|$|E
50|$|Public Service Motivation (PSM) is a theorized {{attribute}} {{of government and}} non-governmental organization (NGO) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the {{theory and practice of}} PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for <b>more</b> financially <b>lucrative</b> careers in the private sector.|$|R
50|$|The modern mass {{production}} of rose water through steam distillation was refined by Persian chemist Avicenna {{in the medieval}} Islamic world which led to more efficient and economic uses for perfumery industries. This allowed for <b>more</b> efficient and <b>lucrative</b> trade.|$|R
5000|$|In recent stories ("Venomous" [...] and [...] "Senseless Violence"), Shocker has {{revealed}} that he is extremely frustrated with his place in life, {{not wanting to be}} known as a punching bag for superheroes like Spider-Man. He unsuccessfully attempts to purchase the Venom symbiote at auction in order to gain some respect. When temporarily partnered with Hydro-Man, he rebukes Morrie's suggestion that they go kill Spider-Man, being far more interested in <b>more</b> financially <b>lucrative</b> ventures and trying to rebuild a professional reputation.|$|R
5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to become a}} professional wrestler, Reiher trained with his father, Jimmy Snuka in New Jersey. He then began working under the ring name Solo in the UWA in California. During his time in UWA, he was offered a contract by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), but turned it down {{in favor of a}} <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> contract from UWA. After the UWA went out of business in late 2001, Reiher began working for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), a promotion run by Jimmy Hart, The Nasty Boys, and Greg Valentine. In XWF, he used the name Jimmy Snuka Jr. and was managed by his father. He appeared at the first round of XWF tapings in November 2001, defeating Buddy Lee Parker and Vapor in two separate matches.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area. His reputation, along with actions such as verbally assaulting umpires and fans, forced him to move on to other teams, which landed him in New York City playing for the Metropolitans, which was an all-professional club but had yet to join a major league; they later joined the National League in 1883. He became the team's ace pitcher, winning 38games, including notable victories against Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings, and most of the other top professional teams in the country at the time.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E
2500|$|China's {{installed}} coal-based {{electrical capacity}} was 907 GW, or 77% {{of the total}} electrical capacity, in 2014. The dominant technology {{in the country is}} coal pulverization in lieu of the more advanced and preferred coal gasification. [...] China's move to a more open economy in the 1990s is cited as a reason for this, where the <b>more</b> immediately <b>lucrative</b> pulverization technology was favored by businesses.

50|$|Agriculture {{and animal}} {{husbandry}} {{are the primary}} economic activities in Ghor Province. According to the United Nations, many young men were forced to leave the province to find work in Herat or Iran and {{a small percentage of}} the population were teachers, government officials, carpet weavers, carpenters and tailors. Over half of the population could not cover their basic needs with their level of income. Opium production had returned to the region following the Taliban's departure as locals attempted to increase their incomes by farming a <b>more</b> economically <b>lucrative</b> crop.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the class}} have survived into {{preservation}} thanks to the high workload of Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, which found it easier and <b>more</b> commercially <b>lucrative</b> to scrap railway wagons, keeping the more technical steam locomotives for a downturn in workload. Five of the surviving Merchant Navy's have run in preservation with three of them having even run on the mainline: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, presently only 35028 is mainline certified with 35018 due to be certified shortly.|$|R
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, {{track and}} field became {{increasingly}} more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are <b>more</b> <b>lucrative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed. Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance, supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry's products. By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub {{of a network of}} forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies. These trading links gave Birmingham's metalworkers access to much wider markets, allowing them to diversify away from lower-skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale, towards a broader range of specialist, higher-skilled and <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> activities.|$|E

5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England {{before he}} was twenty. Though {{speaking}} little English at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 {{years old when he}} assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> position in California at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master.|$|E
25|$|Many {{nurses who}} {{qualified}} with a diploma {{can choose to}} upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field {{as a part of}} this upgrading. In England, it is also much <b>more</b> financially <b>lucrative,</b> as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary. However, from September 2013 onwards all students can only study at degree level, while diplomas are gradually being phased out permanently.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{being the}} oldest, and {{originally}} only, form of cricket played by women internationally, South Africa have played just twelve Test matches (half of them against England), {{with the most}} recent Test being played against India in 2014.

50|$|Beyond {{the office}} of the prefect, the Vigiles were ordered by rank similar to the military. While some terms of service could extend beyond twenty years, most {{commissioned}} ranks were much shorter. Since the Vigiles never achieved the prestige of the Praetorian Guard or the Urban Cohorts, serving in the corps was usually only a means of achieving <b>more</b> honourable and <b>lucrative</b> posts.|$|R
5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for <b>more</b> <b>lucrative</b> exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the timing}} of the {{availability}} of DECT, in the mid-1990s, was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to the <b>more</b> immediately <b>lucrative</b> market for cordless telephones. A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the U.S. market, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECT's time as a technically competitive wireless data transport had passed.|$|R
50|$|Seoul National University said Hwang's {{resignation}} request {{will not}} be accepted, citing a university regulation that dictates an employee under investigation may not resign from a post. This regulation is effected to prevent premature resignations by investigated employees, which {{would allow them to}} avoid full retributions according to the findings of the investigation (and perhaps avoid involuntary termination), while reaping the benefits of the <b>more</b> honorable and <b>lucrative</b> voluntary resignation.|$|R
50|$|The LMS was in {{competition}} with the GWR and in 1927 - 1928 it put in hand work to upgrade the line {{to use it for}} traffic from Bristol and Avonmouth. Track was relaid and upgraded and signalling systems were improved, with extensions to the passing loops and improve the signalling.
