Findings confirmed that expressions of anger, guilt, and shame by a majority group member were seen as unrepresentative, and interactions including these expressions can be experienced as positive by <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> members.

The Czech Republic carried out investigation of diverse ethnic groups but did not implement investigation of the specific needs of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group.</b> The objective was focusing on mapping the approach of the Polish nationals to their health, on identification of their lifestyle, their approach to prevention, their attitude to home care and the specifics in the approach to dying. Hypotheses: H 1 Statistically, the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population with higher education shows better results in their approach to their health than the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population with elementary education. H 2 Younger women of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population with elementary education are more prone to agree with the statement on importance of attending preventive examinations by gynecologist than older women. H 3 Based on the statistical assessment the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population with higher education gives higher preferences for preparation of meals and catering based on both cuisines (Czech and Polish) than with elementary education. H 4 Men of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population occasionally consuming alcohol are statistically significantly prevailing over women of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population occasionally consuming alcohol. H 5 The older Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population has higher frequency of activities with the family than the younger Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population. H 6 The confession of faith of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population significantly affects their approach to abortion compared to the nonbelieving population. H 7 Older women of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population give more frequent preference to home care services than men of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population. H 8 Women of the Polish <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> population more frequently require attendance of family members when dying than men. Methodology: The research part of the work was carried out by the method of quantitative research investigation. The selected set consisted of 277 persons. The results: 94, 90 % of the respondents agree that they take care of their health. However, H 1 regarding approach to health was not confirmed. By comparing the results of the investigation we found out that more than 75 % of the respondents take proper prevention in all cases. H 2 focusing on prevention was confirmed. The level of consummation of vegetable and fruit in case of the Polish national <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> is higher than the level of the Czech population. H 3 was confirmed by testing. H 4 connected with consummation of alcohol was not confirmed. This was confirmed in the research investigation; however, H 5 was not confirmed. The result of 88. 40 % respondents who confessed their faith has not impacted the result of H 6 which was not confirmed. The objective of the work included also identification of the attitude and experience with home care agency which was indicated by 46. 60 % respondents. H 7 was not confirmed. We were surprised by the identified attitude of the respondents to their faith in live after death, to attendance of family members or a priest in case of dying when in all cases more than 20 % respondents responded that they did not know. H 8 was not confirmed by testing. Conclusion: The thesis gives a summary of information on the Polish national <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> living in the Těšín region of Silesia. The final thesis outlines a proposal for a Standard of nursery care of the Polish national <b>minority</b> <b>group.</b> The results of the research investigation will be also presented at conferences.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Two studies (longitudinal, N= 510; cross-sectional; N= 249) explain how feeling valued in one’s ethnic/sexual <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> has benefits for mental health but also certain costs through the way it shapes minorities’ identity. Drawing from the intragroup status and health model (ISAH) we posit that when individuals feel valued in their <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> it bolsters group identification; with greater identity-centrality individuals tend to view daily social interactions through the ‘lens’ of their <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> and ultimately perceive more discrimination. Discrimination, in turn, negatively shapes health. Thus, feeling valued in one’s <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> has benefits for health but also indirect costs, perhaps counterintuitively by strengthening <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> identity. Both studies supported these predictions. Study 2 also supported an adapted ISAH model, for use in the context of concealable stigmatized identities (sexual minorities). Overall, the ISAH model explains why feeling valued and having strong social identities are not always beneficial, yielding certain costs for stigmatized individuals’ health...|$|R

40|$|This {{field study}} {{is an attempt}} to provide {{detailed}} suggestions for a one semester elective course of study Australian Minorities: Concepts and Perspectives to be offered at a tertiary institution. It is intended primarily to provide a context in which <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> persons can be introduced to and analyse the theories and concepts which have been used to describe them as <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> persons, and to give <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> persons the opportunity to formulate and develop their own theories and concepts derived from their own experience. Since the program in which the course is offered is already operating and this course is a required part of it, the case for the provision of specific courses for <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> students is not argued here. The purpose in providing a detailed course description through this field study is (a) to contribute to the, as yet, small number of tertiary level courses from which both <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> and mainstream students select their programs, and (b) to provide suggestions for teachers of such courses to enable them to present courses which have specific interest for <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> students. The principles on which the course is constructed constitute a blending of humanistic and social reconstructionist perspectives with the purpose of (a) making the course acceptable to the espoused values of institutions offering teacher education programs, and (b) providing students with some knowledge and skills whereby they are empowered to make changes in the societies in which they will work. The course was compiled from (a) Suggestions solicited on an informal basis from students involved in an initial teaching of a similar course. (b) The writer's perceptions of needs arising from experience of teaching in a tertiary program catering specifically for Aboriginal and Islander persons. (c) Library research of, especially, material written by <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> persons, but also material written about <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> persons. Suggestions for evaluating the effectiveness of the course are provided because it is intended that this course be used as a base or beginning structure to generate new courses, or for modifications of this one according to specific needs of teachers and student groups. It is presented in a form intended to be useful {{as a starting point for}} other <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> teachers involved in offering courses to cater for similar needs.
