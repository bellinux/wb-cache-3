This {{research}} work {{focuses on the}} use of integrated control and asset management (ICAM) in optimizing process plant operations. The assets considered are mainly valves and instruments, such as pressure, flow, temperature and level transmitters. The dissertation discusses how integrated control and asset management could be used to detect potential process problems as well as incipient faults in field devices and valves. Integrated control and asset management is a technology whereby the control loop or system is made to perform functions other than its traditional function of controlling the process in order to achieve an improved production target. The conditions of the instruments, valves and the process itself are monitored with the aid of another system called asset management. The condition monitoring data is superimposed on the process control signal thus giving the name ‘integrated’. Commonly known as artificial intelligent design, the asset management software is able to unlock data buried in a distributed control system (DCS), supervisory control and digital acquisition (SCADA), programmable logic control (PLC) or other remote terminal units (RTUs), analyze it and give actionable recommendations. Two plants in Sasol which have deployed the ICAM technology were investigated namely the Auto-Thermal reforming (ATR) plant and the N-Butanol plant. The research investigation revealed that the use of ICAM gives rise to i) 	a proactive maintenance strategy ii) 	increased uptime which means reduced downtime iii) 	increased throughput iv) 	removal of unnecessary <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> and instruments and v) 	an improved way of running the process. The ICAM technology has been made possible by the HART technology, the foundation fieldbus technology as well as SMART-based instruments and valves. Some limitations of ICAM were also discovered as well as other factors that could hamper it from delivering its full benefits. Master...|$|E
40|$|Chronic venous {{disease and}} venous {{hypertension}} are common consequences <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> insufficiency, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating {{the formation and}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> venous <b>valves</b> have not been studied. Here, we provide what {{we believe to be}} the first description <b>of</b> venous <b>valve</b> morphogenesis and identify signaling pathways required for the process. The initial stages <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> development were found to involve induction of ephrin-B 2, a key marker of arterial identity, by venous endothelial cells. Intriguingly, developing and mature venous valves also expressed a repertoire of proteins, including prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox 1), Vegfr 3, and integrin-α 9, previously characterized as specific and critical regulators of lymphangiogenesis. Using global and venous valve–selective knockout mice, we further demonstrate the requirement of ephrin-B 2 and integrin-α 9 signaling for the development and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> venous <b>valves.</b> Our findings therefore identified molecular regulators <b>of</b> venous <b>valve</b> development and maintenance and highlighted the involvement of common morphogenetic processes and signaling pathways in controlling valve formation in veins and lymphatic vessels. Unexpectedly, we found that venous valve endothelial cells closely resemble lymphatic (valve) endothelia at the molecular level, suggesting plasticity in the ability of a terminally differentiated endothelial cell to take on a different phenotypic identity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective:We {{evaluated}} {{the capability of}} the Myocor Coapsys device (Myocor, Inc, Maple Grove, Minn) to reduce functional mitral regurgitation in a canine model of dilated cardiomyopathy. MethodsFunctional mitral regurgitation with heart failure was induced in 7 dogs by rapid ventricular pacing. The Coapsys device, which consists of anterior and posterior epicardial pads connected by a subvalvular chord, was then implanted. Heart failure was maintained by continued pacing for 8 weeks. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements were performed at pre- and postsizing and after 8 weeks. The Coapsys subvalvular chord was cut to verify that <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> competency {{was due to the}} device. ResultsAll implants were performed off-pump without atriotomy. Mitral regurgitation was reduced in all animals; mean mitral regurgitation grade was reduced from 2. 9 ± 0. 7 to 0. 7 ± 0. 8 (P =. 00005) and was maintained at 0. 8 ± 0. 8 after 8 weeks, without hemodynamic compromise or structural damage to the mitral valve. Mitral regurgitation returned to 3. 6 ± 0. 8 (P =. 102 versus presizing) after cutting the Coapsys subvalvular chord. ConclusionThe Coapsys device consistently and chronically reduced functional mitral regurgitation. This device is in clinical trials in the United States...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Stiction {{in control}} valves is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the control valve to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the control valves to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the control valve sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the faulty <b>valves,</b> which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> defective <b>valves</b> is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty control valve, especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty control valves...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} the aortic {{heart valve}} is a challenging endeavor {{because of the}} particular hemodynamic and biologic conditions present in the native aortic heart <b>valve.</b> The backbone <b>of</b> an ideal <b>valve</b> substitute should be a scaffold that {{is strong enough to}} withstand billions of repetitive bending, flexing and stretching cycles, while also being slowly degradable to allow for remodeling. In this review, we highlight three overlooked aspects that might influence the long term durability of tissue engineered valves: (i) replication <b>of</b> the native <b>valve</b> trilayered histoarchitecture, (ii) duplication of the three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> the <b>valve,</b> (iii) and cell integration efforts focused on getting the right number and type of cells to the right place within the valve structure and driving them towards homeostatic <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> matrix. We propose that the trilayered structure in the native aortic valve that includes a middle spongiosa layer cushioning the motions of the two external fibrous layers should be our template for creation of novel scaffolds with improved mechanical durability. Furthermore, since cells adapt to micro-loads within the valve structure, we believe that interstitial cell remodeling of the valvular matrix will depend on the accurate replication of the structures and loads, resulting in successful regeneration <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> tissue and extended durability...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{hydraulic}} tappets {{are more}} sensitive to engine oil quality and frequency of oil changes, as carbon sludge and residues may easily lock up the tappets or block oil channels, making the clearance setting ineffective. This has negative impact especially on the engine camshaft and valves due to excessive wear if the clearance setting is not working correctly. As mentioned, one may avoid this by using the manufacturer-recommended grade of engine oil, and by not exceeding the prescribed oil change interval. It is a myth that in certain circumstances, a lifter can [...] "pump up" [...] and create negative valve clearance. The engine oil pump cannot generate enough pressure to cause [...] "pump-up". The problem is due to weak valve springs which permit float at high engine speeds. The followers attempt to take up {{what they see as}} extra clearance. As this speed is maintained, the lifter will continue to expand until the valve is held off its seat when it should be closed. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> springs at the correct strength is therefore very important to avoid engine damage.|$|R
40|$|Given that {{refrigerant}} {{demand is}} set to rapidly increase, long term solutions for leakage prevention are required to effect change in the industry. This paper {{presents the results of}} a project which investigated refrigerant leakage within two of the UK’s major supermarket chains. Leakage data from 1, 464 maintenance records were analysed. The analysis categorized the type, location of each leak and volume of refrigerant replaced during repair. Over 82 % of the recorded leaks were from R 404 A refrigeration systems, and mainly consisted of pipe or joint failures or a leaking seal/gland/core located in the compressor pack and the high pressure liquid line. It is recommended that the industry focuses on improving design, installation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> pipework and <b>valves,</b> at the components that most often develop faults to minimize refrigerant leakage...|$|R
40|$|Explanted {{mechanical}} {{heart valves}} were examined nondestructively, and {{the findings were}} related to guidelines, technical reports, and other information to judge the risk of failure and its possible impact on valve design and clinical practice. Diagnoses for single valves could be made, but risks and rates of failure for patient populations could not be predicted due to insufficient information concerning the manufacturing process and valve and patient numbers. Based {{on the results of}} this study and the principle that decisions on recalls and patient counseling must be based on scientific knowledge rather than on wait and see policies, the following is recommended: registration <b>of</b> all implanted <b>valves,</b> follow-up <b>of</b> a large cohort <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> carriers, comparison <b>of</b> wear test results of preimplant and postretrieval <b>valves,</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> a reference stock <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> and materials, and submission of failure scenarios to certifying bodie...|$|R
40|$|The Oxygen Generation System Laptop Bus Controller Flight Software was {{developed}} to allow the International Space Station (ISS) program to activate specific components of the Oxygen Generation System (OGS) to perform a checkout of key hardware operation in a microgravity environment, {{as well as to}} perform preventative <b>maintenance</b> operations <b>of</b> system <b>valves</b> during a long period of what would otherwise be hardware dormancy. The software provides direct connectivity to the OGS Firmware Controller with pre-programmed tasks operated by on-orbit astronauts to exercise OGS valves and motors. The software is used to manipulate the pump, separator, and valves to alleviate the concerns of hardware problems due to long-term inactivity and to allow for operational verification of microgravity-sensitive components early enough so that, if problems are found, they can be addressed before the hardware is required for operation on-orbit. The decision was made to use existing on-orbit IBM ThinkPad A 31 p laptops and MIL-STD- 1553 B interface cards as the hardware configuration. The software {{at the time of this}} reporting {{was developed}} and tested for use under the Windows 2000 Professional operating system to ensure compatibility with the existing on-orbit computer systems...|$|R

50|$|HB-EGF binding and {{activation}} of EGF receptors plays {{a critical role}} during cardiac valve tissue development and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> normal heart function in adults. During valve tissue development the interaction of HB-EGF with EGF receptors and heparan sulfate proteogylcans {{is essential for the}} prevention <b>of</b> malformation <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> due to enlargement. In the vascular system areas of disturbed flow show upregulation of HB-EGF with promotion of vascular lesions, atherogenesis, and hyperplasia of intimal tissue in vessels. The flow disturbance remodeling of the vascular tissues due to HB-EGF expression contributes to aortic valve disease, peripheral vascular disease, and conduit stenosis.|$|R
