40|$|Specifies {{requirements}} for factory-assembled metal-enclosed <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> {{for alternating current}} of rated voltages above 1 kV and {{up to and including}} 52 kV for indoor and outdoor installation, and for service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. Enclosures may include fixed and removable components and may be filled with fluid (liquid or gas) to provide insulation. This standard defines several types of metal enclosed <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> which differ due to - the consequences on network service continuity in case of maintenance on the <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> controlgear; - the need and convenience of maintenance of the equipment. For metal-enclosed <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> containing gas-filled compartments, the design pressure is limited to a maximum of 300 kPa (relative pressure). Metal-enclosed <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> for special use, for example, in flammable atmospheres, in mines or on board ships, may be subject to additional requirements. Components contained in metal-enclosed <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> are to be designed and tested in accordance with their various relevant standards. This standard supplements the standards for the individual components regarding their installation in <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> assemblies. This standard does not preclude that other equipment may be included in the same enclosure. In such a case, any possible influence of that equipment on the <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> is to be taken into account. This first edition of IEC 62271 - 200 cancels and replaces the third edition of IEC 60298, published in 1990, and constitutes a technical revision. Significant technical changes from the third edition of IEC 60298 are as follows: This revised document has been basically changed to be updated to today's use of high- voltage <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> up to 52 kV. The main changes are: new definitions and classification of equipment, introduction of internal arc classes (IAC) and its testing. This standard is...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Low-voltage <b>switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlgear</b> {{assemblies}} with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage <b>Switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>Controlgear</b> Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially type-tested and specially tested assemblies with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially tested assemblies. The specially tested assembly is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage <b>Switchgear</b> <b>and</b> <b>Controlgear</b> Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially tested assembly (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially tested assembly (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially tested assembly (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a type-tested assembly (TTA). The document highlights the technical inadequacies of an assembly that is certified as a STA, in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, and the potential safety risks associated with this type of assembly classification...|$|R

50|$|In {{those early}} days, the {{electrical}} manufacturers of England held exhibitions {{of their products}} at Olympia. The highest voltage available was 20,000 volts, and even 11,000 volts was then a high and awe-inspiring potential. There {{were a number of}} high-voltage switch-panels on show, with white porcelain insulators and red, white and blue painted bus-bars; and their manufactures glories at hanging notices on these panels “20,000 volts - DANGER”. But Clothier, with his protective <b>metal-clad</b> <b>switchgear</b> in place, hung up on his panel “20,000 volts - NO DANGER”.|$|R
50|$|Outdoor, {{above-ground}} {{substation structures}} include wood pole, lattice metal tower, and tubular metal structures, although other variants are available. Where space is plentiful and {{appearance of the}} station is not a factor, steel lattice towers provide low-cost supports for transmission lines and apparatus. Low-profile substations may be specified in suburban areas where appearance is more critical. Indoor substations may be gas-insulated switchgear (at high voltages), or metal-enclosed or <b>metal-clad</b> <b>switchgear</b> at lower voltages. Urban and suburban indoor substations may be finished on the outside so as {{to blend in with}} other buildings in the area.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 Clothier went to Tyneside to {{work with}} Charles Hesterman Merz and Bernard Price and joined Mr Alphonse C. Reyrolle at A. Reyrolle & Company in 1906, and {{remained}} employed with them {{for the rest of}} his life. In Tyneside he began an investigation of protective gear for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution at the instigation of Charles Merz and Bernard Price. While thus engaged his attention was directed to improvement of high-voltage switchgear. At the time, switchgear was prone to catching fire, making switchrooms a dangerous place to work. It was largely due to Clothier's work and initiative that both the Merz-Price protective-gear <b>and</b> the <b>metal-clad</b> <b>switchgear,</b> which controlled arcing on open-type electric switchboards, became not only technically but commercially practicable.|$|R
