40|$|The {{invention}} is a {{semiconductor device}} assembly and method {{of making the}} same. A <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> has positioning means for positioning the plate relative to a header, a first mounting surface of the plate {{is attached to the}} header and a semiconductor device is attached to a second mounting surface of the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate.</b> The assembly is made by forming the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate,</b> positioning the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> relative to the header by the positioning means, attaching the first mounting surface to the header and the semiconductor device to the second mounting surface. Another method of making the assembly is by defining and etching a <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> and attaching the first mounting surface to the header and the semiconductor device to the second mounting surface. This assembly and process provides an efficient means for mounting semiconductor devices and in particular electro-optic devices such as lasers...|$|R
30|$|Since {{there was}} no {{allowance}} to either screw or weld any lugs to the pile, the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> was bonded {{by means of a}} thick layer semi-structural adhesive as well (see Fig.  10, left). The upper part of the monopiles was coated by a corrosion protection which had to stay intact. Thus, no grinding was performed here but the coating was cleaned and the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> as well as all cables and a strain relief were bonded directly to the coating. As stated before, the data acquisition unit and the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> had a weight of about 65  kg.|$|R

50|$|The {{advancement}} of optical erector set perhaps began with educational toys designed for children. These injection molded plastic kits allowed {{the child to}} construct various optical instruments such as a Telescope, microscope, and spectroscope. Perhaps the most advanced erector set for optics was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer in Germany called: Microbench, patent number 2636657 filed on July 13, 1976. It consisted of 40x40 mm square <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> with 25 or 30 mm holes at the center, and four 6 mm bores around the edges. If four 6 mm rods were secured on the corners, a second mounting plate could slide along the rods, and secured at any point via set screws. Furthermore, by securing individual lenses within each mounting plate, a telescope could be constructed. A larger system was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer for constructing larger optical experiments: Patent number 3,945,600 filed on Mar 23, 1976. This was called Macrobench which consisted of 150x150 mm <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> capable of securing up to 110 mm optical elements. The rods were of course bigger (20 mm in diameter), and were hollow inside. Ith combining these <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> much higher precision optical experiments could have been constructed such as an interferometer, etc.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{mounting}} thin samples for electrical measurements is described. A vacuum chuck holds a <b>mounting</b> <b>plate,</b> which, in turn, holds the sample. Contacts on the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> establish electrical connection to the sample. The attachment of wires directly to the samples is unnecessary. Measurements can be made at temperatures from 77 to 1000 K. As an application of the apparatus, resistivity and Hall measurements of a thin silicon carbide sample are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{mounting}} thin samples for electrical measurements is described. The technique {{is based on}} a vacuum chuck concept in which the vacuum chuck simultaneously holds the sample and established electrical contact. The <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> is composed of a glass-ceramic insulating material and the surfaces of the plate and vacuum chuck are polished. The operation of the vacuum chuck is examined. The contacts on the sample and <b>mounting</b> <b>plate,</b> which are sputter-deposited through metal masks, are analyzed. The mounting method was utilized for van der Pauw measurements...|$|R

40|$|A flight {{experiment}} of a mechanically pumped two-phase ammonia {{thermal control}} system, incorporating {{a number of}} new component designs, has been assembled and tested in a 1 -g environment. Additional microgravity tests are planned on the Space Shuttle when Shuttle flights are resumed. The primary purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the operation of a mechanically pumped two-phase ammonia system, with emphasis on determining the performance of an evaporative Two-Phase <b>Mounting</b> <b>Plate.</b> The experiment also evaluates the performance of other specially designed components, such as the two-phase reservoir for temperature control, condensing radiator/heat sink, spiral tube boiler, and pressure drop experiment. The 1 -g tests have shown that start-up of the two-phase experiment is easily accomplished with only a partial fill of ammonia. The experiment maintained a constant <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> temperature without flow rate controls over a very wide range of heat loads, flow rates, inlet flow conditions and exit qualities. The tests also showed the successful operation of the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> in the heat sharing condensing mode...|$|R

50|$|Several {{motorcycle}} dealers made {{equipment for}} Triton conversions, some {{would do the}} complete job for customers while others sold complete Tritons. The most important part required are the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> and several different designs exist that can affect the engine placement and therefore the handling. The lower the engine is mounted the better the handling achieved from the Norton frame.|$|E
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the Arca-Swiss system is that the <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> are {{designed}} to prevent accidental rotation of the plate relative to the device. When used with a camera or camera body the plates incorporate an anti-rotation flange or lip. When mounted to a lens with a foot, the plate will often be secured with two screws to prevent rotation. When this type of system is used, the camera cannot become accidentally detached from the tripod, which is possible when using a quick-release system that doesn't prevent rotation, or when no camera mount is used. Nearly all makes and models of modern SLRs, medium format cameras, and large lenses have specific plates available with anti-rotation flanges. There are plates available for certain models of other formats of cameras, such as point and shoots, as well. Universal <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> are also available, {{which can be used}} with nearly any camera with a tripod mount, though they provide little or no anti-rotation protection.|$|E
40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of {{full-scale}} prototype units of a two-phase <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> (TPMP), which {{will be used in}} a two-phase ammonia-based thermal control system for a large spacecraft, are described. The <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> uses an evaporator design in which liquid is mechanically pumped through porous feed tubes within the plate. The prototype TPMPs were tested with ammonia at heat loads over 3000 W (3. 2 W/sq cm) and local heat fluxes of up to 4 W/sq cm. Calculated total heat transfer coefficients from these tests were between 0. 8 and 1. 0 W/sq cm per C. This represents a better than twenty-fold improvement over comparable single-phase heat transfer coefficients. Design diagrams are included...|$|R

This plate, available for use on the side-mount carrier, was for larger experiments or hardware requirements. Customer hardware mounted on plates may have needed additional customer-provided thermal control provisions, such as heaters or blankets.|$|E
