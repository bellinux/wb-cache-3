5000|$|The forest's most {{abundant}} tree is the <b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress,</b> a species {{also known as}} the Bucaco Cedar or Cedar of Goa. The tree was first mentioned by Portuguese scholar Bernarda de Lacerda in her Soledades de Buçaco, a collection of poems published in 1634. In 1768 English botanist Philip Miller provoked a 200-year-long debate after claiming the tree had been introduced to Portugal from Goa. Miller's claim was formally rebutted in 1993 when a paper published by the International Association for Plant Taxonomy reclassified the species as a native of Mexico. Ten years later further research into the tree's origins was undertaken using DNA tests: results showed that while the <b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress</b> is {{more likely to have been}} introduced to the forest from Mexico than India, the supporting data is [...] "not very strong".|$|E
40|$|The {{range of}} Taxodium mucronatum Ten. (<b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress)</b> is declining rapidly, yet {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about the propagation of this valuable ornamental tree. The objective of this study was to determine whether seed coat treatments could enhance the germination of <b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress.</b> Seeds of <b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress</b> were collected from Las Cruces and the Gila National Forest, New Mexico. In one experiment, seed coats were knicked or left intact, then germinated on moist filter paper or flooded with water. In another experiment, seed coats from the Las Cruces provenance were treated with sulfuric acid, knicked, left intact, or removed (excised embryos) and germinated on moist filter paper. Knicked and moist seeds had a greater mean cumulative germination percentage (13. 5 %) than intact and flooded seeds (4. 2 %). Final germination percentage of the Las Cruces source was similar among knicked seeds, intact seeds, and excised embryos, but intact seeds took a longer time (15 days) to reach 50 % of final germination percentage than did excised embryos (10 days) and knicked seeds (8 days). Seeds treated with sulfuric did not germinate. Results indicate seed coat pretreatments are needed to release physical dormancy and promote efficient germination of <b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress</b> (Taxodium mucronatum Ten.) is {{propagated}} from seed, but {{procedures have}} not been reported for the propagation of this ornamental tree by stem cuttings. This study evaluated the use of softwood cuttings to propagate <b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress.</b> Softwood cuttings were collected on 16 October 1998 and 1999 from Las Cruces and Los Lunas, New Mexico, treated with either 3000 or 8000 ppm of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and held under intermittent mist in a greenhouse for 13 weeks. In 1998, cuttings sampled from one of two Los Lunas trees showed 48 % and 82 % rooting when treated with IBA at 3000 or 8000 ppm, respectively. Root number and average root length were 9 and 3 times greater, respectively, with 8000 ppm IBA than with 3000 ppm IBA. More 1998 cuttings rooted (65 %) than 1999 cuttings (10 %) when means were combined over IBA treatments. Results indicate that efficient propagation of <b>Mexican</b> bald <b>cypress</b> by cuttings depends on exogenous IBA and selection of stock plants amenable to root formation...|$|R
40|$|The famous {{tree that}} has puzzled {{travelers}} and botanists {{for hundreds of}} years with its legends now raises new questions about its future. Outside the city of Oaxaca, on the ancient lands of the Mixtecs and Zapotecs in southern Mexico, stands a tree, perhaps the most famous and most frequently measured among the giants: a unique specimen of the fast-growing southern bald cypress, Taxodium mucronatum, known by the Aztecs as an ahuehuete, the "graybeard of the swamp.

50|$|Cupressus nootkatensis is an {{evergreen}} tree {{growing up}} to 40 meters (133 feet) tall, commonly with pendulous branches. The foliage is in flat sprays, with dark green, 3-5 mm long scale-leaves. The cones have 4 (occasionally 6) scales, and resemble the cones of <b>Mexican</b> <b>Cypress</b> (Cupressus lusitanica, another Cupressus species which can show foliage in flat sprays) fairly closely, except being somewhat smaller, typically 10-14 mm diameter; each scale has a pointed triangular bract about 1.5-2 mm long, again {{similar to other}} Cupressus and unlike the crescent-shaped, non-pointed bract on the scales of Chamaecyparis cones. The Caren Range {{on the west coast}} of British Columbia is home to the oldest Nootka Cypress specimens in the world, with one specimen found to be 1,834 years old (Gymnosperm Database).|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{they use}} other means {{to get to}} the Chalma area, modern pilgrims still follow the same narrow steep paths to the site that their {{ancestors}} used {{to get to the}} cave of Oxtoteotl and wearing flowers as they did. If the walk is done at night, pilgrims carry torches and candles. [...] Before the 1970s the trip from the main highway to the village of Chalma could take eight hours or more by foot. Although there is now a paved road to the village, it is very winding through the rugged terrain. On the way, there are lodgings, some in private homes, for traveling pilgrims.Once arrived at the sanctuary, most pilgrims follow a number of traditional activities. One of the main purposes is to dance in the sanctuary complex. Traditional dances from all over Mexico are performed at this sanctuary, with some pilgrims dressed in the traditional clothing of their region. This dancing in honor of the Christ of Chalma is believed to cleanse sins. [...] This ritual is so famous that in Mexico, there is a saying that when one asks for something impossible, they cannot perform the deed “without going to dance at Chalma.”For many pilgrims, {{it is also important to}} visit a large, centuries-old <b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress</b> tree, next to which is a spring that emerges from the earth here. These are the same waters that pagan ancestors bathed in before the arrival of Christianity. For first-time pilgrims this visit is essential. [...] The waters of the spring are claimed to have miraculous properties according to popular belief. First-time pilgrims must circle the tree three times. [...] Many pilgrims ritually bathe themselves in these waters, and once clean, they are crowned with flowers to be ready to enter the sanctuary. [...] Some people believe that not doing the ritual of the tree and spring will turn one into stone.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{our group}} has {{established}} an experimental system using cultured cells obtained from Cupressus lusitanica (<b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress)</b> [13]. The elicitor-treated C. lusitanica cell cultures produce {{many types of}} olefine and oxygenated monoterpenes with {{a significant amount of}} β-thujaplicin [14, 15]. In this cell line, a 13 C-glucose feeding experiment demonstrated that β-thujaplicin was biosynthesized via an ordinary six-membered ring intermediate, i.e., a menthane-type skeleton produced by terpene synthase and followed by ring expansion to a unique conjugated seven-membered ring, tropolone [16]. Assays of terpinolene and terpinolene synthase suggested that terpinolene is the first olefin monoterpene intermediate in β-thujaplicin production [15].|$|E

40|$|The Kenyan {{landscape}} {{is undergoing a}} dramatic change. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress</b> tree Cupressus Iusitanica, which is grown on 45 % of the country's total industrial forest plantation area, is falling victim to the cypress aphid, Cinara cupressi, an insect which causes dieback, discoloration and eventually death. Infestations of Cinara cupressi have also been reported from Malawi, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Zimbabwe. The first reported sighting of the cypress aphid in Kenya was in March l 990. Surveys only three months later showed that it had spread to over 80 % of the country's forests and was also threatening windbreaks and hedges grown for fuelwood. In the warm climate of Eastern and Southern Africa the cypress aphid does not overwinter for a prolonged period in an egg stage {{as it does in}} its indigenous northern temperate regions. Parthenogenetic reproduction continues year round and since the lifespan of a single generation is about 25 days, and there are no natural enemies, populations increase rapidly. The aphids inject a salivary fluid into the tree so that they can digest the sap, but this is toxic to the tree. Feeding causes desiccation of the stems and the progressive dieback of heavily in(ested trees. Aphids also produce honeydew and this encourages the growth of sooty mould which can interfere with photosynthesis. Long-term pest management options are being actively sought by FAO in response to a request from the government of Malawi and, in the UK, the International Institute of Biological Control (IIBC) has begun a search for a biological control agent. In Kenya FAO has funded an emergency technical cooperation programme to help institute emergency control measures until a longer-term project gets under way. A full-scale project will aim to establish an IPM system within five years. Eventually a combination of silvicultural, genetic and biological measures IS likely to be developed to counter the effect of the aphid but, in the short term, early harvesting of trees which are in danger of dying minimizes economic loss and reduces fire hazard.

30|$|We showed {{previously}} that in Cupressus lusitanica (<b>Mexican</b> <b>cypress),</b> {{the first}} two steps of terpinolene oxidation, beginning at hydroxylation at the aryl position and then forming epoxide at the double bond, were driven by cytochrome P 450 s. The significance of enantio differences, in general, has received attention because those enantiomers often have their own biological activities. We, therefore, investigated the stereo-specificity of the substrate and the enantio-selectivity of these reactions. The hydroxylation of terpinolene by cytochrome P 450 in the microsomal fraction from C. lusitanica cells gave a single product with an S configuration of 5 -isopropylidene- 2 -methylcyclohex- 2 -enol. Next, epoxidizing enzyme accepted only the S-configuration substrate and produced a single enantiomer product, (1 R, 2 S, 6 S)-(+)- 1, 6 -epoxy- 4 (8)-p-menthen- 2 -ol. No isomer was detected at our gas chromatography/mass spectrometry sensitivity; therefore, the calculated enantiomeric excess values were 100  %. These {{results indicate that the}} cytochrome P 450 s involved in terpinolene metabolism in C. lusitanica cells have very strict stereo-selective ability. Our findings may be helpful in the stereo-selective synthesis of fine chemicals, although the physiological meanings of these chiral products are still not unclear.|$|E
