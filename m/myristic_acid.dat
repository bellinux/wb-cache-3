The aims {{of the present study}} are to examine whether depression is accompanied by autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are formed following O&NS damage; and b) the major anchorage molecules, i. e. palmitic and <b>myristic</b> <b>acids</b> and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. METHODS: We examined serum IgM antibodies to the conjugated fatty <b>acids,</b> palmitic and <b>myristic</b> acids; acetylcholine; S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and NO-modified adducts in 26 depressed patients and 17 normal controls. Severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and severity of fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale. RESULTS: The prevalences and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against conjugated palmitic and <b>myristic</b> <b>acids,</b> acetylcholine, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and the conjugated NO adducts, NO-tyrosine, NO-phenylalanine, NO-aspartate, NO-histidine, and NO-creatine were significantly higher in depressed patients than in normal controls. The autoimmune responses were significantly related to FF symptoms, such as fatigue and a flu-like malaise, whereas the indicants of nitrosative stress were related to gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. DISCUSSION: Depression is characterized by IgM-related autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are normally not detected by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i. e. palmitic and <b>myristic</b> <b>acids,</b> and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine.

2500|$|If the {{membrane}} receptors are denatured or deficient, the signal transduction can be hindered and cause diseases. Some diseases {{are caused by}} disorders of membrane receptor function. [...] This is due to deficiency or degradation of the receptor via changes in the genes that encode and regulate the receptor protein. The membrane receptor TM4SF5 influences the migration of hepatic cells and hepatoma. Also, the cortical NMDA receptor influences membrane fluidity, and is altered in Alzheimer's disease. When the cell is infected by a non-enveloped virus, the virus first binds to specific membrane receptors and then passes itself or a subviral component to the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane. In the case of poliovirus, it is known in vitro that interactions with receptors cause conformational rearrangements which release a virion protein called VP4.The N terminus of VP4 is myristylated and thus hydrophobic【myristic acid=CH3(CH2)12COOH】.

2500|$|The viral {{particle}} binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human {{and some other}} primate species. For this reason, poliovirus couldn’t be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s.

These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected [...] Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase).

The viral lifecycle is very rapid with {{the whole process of}} replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, cell protein synthesis declines to almost zero output – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and [...] in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours.

The concentration of stearic acid increased signtcantly to 351 mg Kg⁻¹ (fat basis) only {{during the first week}} of ripening. Concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids increased significantly during all stages of ripening and approximately doubled during the 3. 5 -day ripening period to reach levels of 425 and 453 mg Kg⁻¹, respectively. Concentrations of butyric, caprylic, lauric and <b>myristic</b> <b>acids</b> were approximately constant during the first week and increased significantly thereafter up to 285, 17, 94 and 59 mg Kg⁻¹, respectively, at 35 days. The concentrations of caprylic and <b>myristic</b> <b>acids</b> increased five-fold in 35 days, the concentration of butyric acid increased three-fold, and the concentration of lauric acid almost doubled during the same period. The concentrations of caproic, capric, linoleic and linolenic acids increased significantly to 48, 121, 188 and 126 mg Kg⁻¹, respectively, only after 21 days of ripening. The concentration of linoleic acid doubled in that time period, while increases in {{the concentrations of}} caproic, capric and linolenic acids were much smaller. The concentrations of butyric, caproic and palmitic acids in cheeses manufactured in February were statistically lower than those in cheeses manufactured in May.
