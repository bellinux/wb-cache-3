Concerning the first topic, Sterzi {{demonstrates that}}, contrary to earlier reports, the longitudinal fissure is not due to pressure exerted by the falx cerebri but that it is the product of the rapid outgrowth of the cerebral hemispheres from the lateral portions of the telencephalic vesicle. He also maintains that the third ventricle consists, not only of the posterior diencephalic portion, but of a smaller anterior one of telencephalic origin. In the second article (Sterzi,1914), Sterzi criticizes the concept put forward by Edinger(1911) that the human brain consists of a neoencephalic portion: the cerebral cortex, and of a paleoencephalic one: the remaining encephalon. He demonstrates that even in the portion that Edinger considers paleoencephalon there are neoencephalic derivatives. Concerning whether all portions of the brain really evolve from lower craniates to man, he demonstrates that this is not the case because, in the course of phylogenesis, some parts evolve and others regress.|$|E

40|$|When {{deterministic}} assumptions in 'classical' location {{problems are}} relaxed some new theoretical and algorithmic problems arise. In this paper, {{the definition of}} medians is generalized to the cases: (1) when generated demands and travel costs are random, and (2) when the demand induced at the facilities is random because of competition. Under {{a particular set of}} assumptions, the well-known theorems on `optimality of node locations' hold for the underlying 'probabilistic networks'. For case (1) the model is shown to be a generalization of the probabilistic and deterministic <b>median</b> <b>location</b> problems on networks. The relationship of the model to a multicommodity location problem is also pointed out. Additionally, {{within the framework of the}} problem formulation, certain parallels with multiobjective location problems are drawn.

40|$|Abstract Background The Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) {{collects}} maternal address {{information at}} the time of delivery for infants and fetuses with birth defects. These addresses have been geocoded by two independent agencies: (1) the Georgia Division of Public Health Office of Health Information and Policy (OHIP) and (2) a commercial vendor. Geographic information system (GIS) methods were used to quantify uncertainty in the two sets of geocodes using orthoimagery and tax parcel datasets. Methods We sampled 599 infants and fetuses with birth defects delivered during 1994 – 2002 with maternal residence in either Fulton or Gwinnett County. Tax parcel datasets were obtained from the tax assessor's offices of Fulton and Gwinnett County. High-resolution orthoimagery for these counties was acquired from the U. S. Geological Survey. For each of the 599 addresses we attempted to locate the tax parcel corresponding to the maternal address. If the tax parcel was identified the distance and the angle between the geocode and the residence were calculated. We used simulated data to characterize the impact of geocode location error. In each county 5, 000 geocodes were generated and assigned their corresponding Census 2000 tract. Each geocode was then displaced at a random angle by a random distance drawn from the distribution of observed geocode location errors. The census tract of the displaced geocode was determined. We repeated this process 5, 000 times and report the percentage of geocodes that resolved into incorrect census tracts. Results <b>Median</b> <b>location</b> error was less than 100 meters for both OHIP and commercial vendor geocodes; the distribution of angles appeared uniform. <b>Median</b> <b>location</b> error was approximately 35 % larger in Gwinnett (a suburban county) relative to Fulton (a county with urban and suburban areas). Location error occasionally caused the simulated geocodes to be displaced into incorrect census tracts; the median percentage of geocodes resolving into incorrect census tracts ranged between 4. 5 % and 5. 3 %, depending upon the county and geocoding agency. Conclusion Geocode location uncertainty can be estimated using tax parcel databases in a GIS. This approach is a viable alternative to global positioning system field validation of geocodes. </p...|$|E
40|$|A model-based algorithm, termed {{exclusion}} {{region and}} position refinement (ERPR), is presented {{for improving the}} accuracy and repeatability of estimating the locations where vascular structures branch and cross over, {{in the context of}} human retinal images. The goal is two fold. First, accurate morphometry of branching and crossover points (landmarks) in neuronal/vascular structure is important to several areas of biology and medicine. Second, these points are valuable as landmarks for image registration, so improved accuracy and repeatability in estimating their locations and signatures leads to more reliable image registration for applications such as change detection and mosaicing. The ERPR algorithm is shown to reduce the <b>median</b> <b>location</b> error from 2. 04 pixels down to 1. 1 pixels, while improving the median spread (a measure of repeatability) from 2. 09 pixels down to 1. 05 pixels.

40|$|AbstractThe one <b>median</b> <b>location</b> {{problem with}} {{stochastic}} demands {{can be solved}} as a deterministic problem by considering the mean of weights as demands. There are also some other approaches in consideration of this problem. However, {{it is better to}} find the probability for each node that shows the chance of the node being in the optimal location, especially when demands are correlated to each other. With this approach, alternative answers with their optimality probability can be found. In small networks with a few nodes, it is not so difficult to solve the problem, because a multivariate normal probability for each node should be calculated. But, when the number of nodes increases, not only do the number of probability calculations increase, but also, the computation time for each multivariate normal distribution grows exponentially. In this paper, a meta-heuristic algorithm, based on modified Simulated Annealing (SA), with consideration of a short term memory module is proposed to find the optimality probability more efficiently. The algorithm was performed on some sample networks with correlated demands...|$|E

Limitations of coverage restrict the analysis to the southern hemisphere, and to local times from the post-midnight sector to just past dusk, via dawn and noon. It is found that the overall <b>median</b> <b>location</b> of the poleward and equatorward boundaries of the oval {{with respect to the}} southern pole are at ~ 14 &deg; and ~ 16 &deg; co-latitude, respectively, with a median latitudinal width of ~ 2 &deg;. These median values vary only modestly with local time around the oval, though the poleward boundary moves closer to the pole near noon (~ 12. 5 &deg;) such that the oval is wider in that sector (median width ~ 3. 5 &deg;) than it is at both dawn and dusk (~ 1. 5 &deg;). It is also shown that the position of the auroral boundaries at Saturn are extremely variable, the poleward boundary being located between 2 &deg; and 20 &deg; co-latitude, and the equatorward boundary between 6 &deg; and 23 &deg;, this variability contrasting sharply with the essentially fixed location of the main oval at Jupiter. Comparison with Voyager plasma angular velocity data mapped magnetically from the equatorial magnetosphere into the southern ionosphere indicates that the dayside aurora lie poleward of the main upward-directed field-aligned current region associated with corotation enforcement, which maps to ~ 20 &deg;&ndash; 24 &deg; co-latitude, while agreeing reasonably with the position of the open-closed field line boundary based on estimates of the open flux in Saturn's tail, located between ~ 11 &deg; and ~ 15 &deg;. In this case, the variability in location can be understood in terms of changes in the open flux present in the system, the changes implied by the Saturn data then matching those observed at Earth as fractions of the total planetary flux. We infer that the broad (few degrees) diffuse auroral emissions and sub-corotating auroral patches observed in the dayside sector at Saturn result from precipitation from hot plasma sub-corotating in the outer magnetosphere in a layer a few Saturn radii wide adjacent to the magnetopause, probably having been injected either by Dungey-cycle or Vasyliunas-cycle dynamics on the nightside...|$|E

Moreover, we present efficient algorithms for determining the FDS and also discuss the conditional case where a certain number of facilities is already assumed to exist and one new facility is to be added. For the multi-facility case we are able to identify a finite set of potential facility locations a priori, which essentially converts the network location model into its discrete counterpart.
