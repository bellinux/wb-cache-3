While such studies <b>may</b> <b>tell</b> us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. While no one doubts that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, Eakins was using {{photography}} to explore sequential movement {{and as a}} reference for painting. Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities. Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to The Swimming Hole. The swimmers are seen {{in the same spot}} and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. [...] "The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it <b>may</b> <b>tell</b> us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch. The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical [...] "severity". Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.|$|E

These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes". He called Carroll {{a leader in the}} field and an [...] "adept communicator", but admits to [...] "feeling uncomfortable" [...] when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field [...] "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial." [...] Coyne pointed out that the idea that the [...] "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution" [...] dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that [...] "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why we lack whiskers and tails." [...] He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that [...] "evolution of form is very much a matter of teaching old genes to make new genes." ...|$|E

But his sons answered him (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One," [...] explaining that just as there was only One in Jacob's heart, so there was only One in their hearts. And Jacob replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever." [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might recite [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever" [...] aloud, but rejected that option, as Moses did not say those words in [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might not recite those words at all, but rejected that option, as Jacob did say the words. So the Rabbis ruled that Jews should recite the words quietly. Rabbi Isaac taught that the School of Rabbi Ammi said that one can compare this practice to that of a princess who smelled a spicy pudding. If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.|$|E
