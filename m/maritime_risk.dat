40|$|A rapid {{increase}} in maritime traffic together with challenging navigation conditions and a vulnerable ecosystem has evoked calls for improving maritime safety in the Gulf of Finland, (the Baltic Sea). It is suggested that these improvements will {{be the result of}} adopting a regionally effective proactive approach to safety policy formulation and management. A proactive approach is grounded on a formal process of identifying, assessing and evaluating accident risks, and adjusting policies or management practices before accidents happen. Currently, maritime safety is globally regulated by internationally agreed prescriptive rules, which are usually revised in reaction to accidents. The proactive Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) is applied to risks common to a ship type or to a particular hazard, when deemed necessary, whereas regional FSA applications are rare. An extensive literature review was conducted in order to examine the opportunities for developing a framework for the GoF for handling regional risks at regional level. Best practices were sought from nuclear safety management and fisheries management, and from a particular case related to <b>maritime</b> <b>risk</b> management. A regional approach that sees maritime safety as a holistic system, and manages it by combining a scientific risk assessment with stakeholder input to identify risks and risk control options, and to evaluate risks is proposed. A regional risk governance framework can improve safety by focusing on actual regional risks, designing tailor-made safety measures to control them, enhancing a positive safety culture in the shipping industry, and by increasing trust among all involved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} ship traffic volume and accidents in the Baltic Sea with a special focus on the Gulf of Finland. The most common accidents are groundings and collisions, usually reported {{to be caused by}} human error. The annual number of Baltic Sea accidents reported to HELCOM varied from 34 – 54 for collisions and 30 – 60 for groundings. The number of yearly port calls varied from 468 – 505 thousand with a peak in 2008. Exact port call data could not be found for all ports and hence had to be estimated. The number of line crossingings in HELCOM AIS data was found to be a good, rough surrogate measure for the total number of port calls and could be used if more precise port call data was not available. By analyzing two separate accident databases, an estimate for accident underreporting was calculated. Different statistical methods yielded an underreporting rate in the range of 40 – 50 %. Lastly, the true number of accidents was estimated, based on the estimated underreporting percentage for the Baltic Sea. Based on these results, the true number of true accidents should be first estimated if accident statistics are used in building or validating <b>maritime</b> <b>risk</b> models.

40|$|The Bayesian Network (BBN) {{has been}} a popular method for risk {{assessment}} especially for the modeling of rare accidents. It could make use of experts&# 039; domain knowledge when historical data were not enough to {{support the use of}} other statistical methods. In the maritime domain, the Bayesian Network has been widely used for risk prediction by modeling the causal relationship of shipping accidents where a lot of human and organizational factors are involved. Most of the models depend on experts&# 039; elicitation for model construction and parameterization. The involvement of experts&# 039; judgment brings uncertainty and biases. In contrast, data-driven BBN is considered more objective since it is learnt from empirical data. However, even though researchers started to explore the application of data-driven BBN in recent years, its application is still constrained due to the rare occurrence of maritime accidents and the incompatibility of accident databases. As a result, experts&# 039; knowledge continues to be an important source for modeling. Reducing the elicitation workload and facilitating the elicitation of individual conditional probability are the two most important tasks for BBN modeling with experts&# 039; knowledge.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>maritime</b> <b>risk,</b> which we {{consider}} important, no doubt, for ship-owners acting in volatile markets. Traditionally, risk {{is measured by}} "standard deviation". Other risk measures like "excess kurtosis", "excess skewness", "long-term dependence" and the "catastrophe propensity" were ignored. Risk in 1900 {{was based on the}} mathematical laws of Chance and influenced greatly by Probability theory due to Pascal and Fermat (1654). Economists, but maritime ones, have understood, however, that the "random walk" model, and the "efficient market hypothesis", failed to interpret reality since Black Monday (1987) at least. The traditional treatment of risk assumes that 95 % of the observations fall within 2 s from their mean. However, the daily data of 4 time-charter routes ("Baltic Panamax Index", May 1996 -February 2012) showed otherwise. Moreover, variance varies from one decade to next, even under stable mean. Risk is related to dispersion, which is defined the same in "normal" and "chaotic dynamic systems". All maritime studies (1997 - 2013), however, reported excess skewness, excess kurtosis, absence of normality and serial correlation [...] . but no remedy provided. As far as the reference to the assumption that observations are "independent and identically distributed" is concerned, maritime time series analysis shows "long term dependence" indicated by a high "Hurst exponent"~ 1. The paper uses "Rescaled Range Analysis"-a nonparametric method, to identify the "Noah effect" (i. e. the propensity of time series towards catastrophe; measured by alpha exponent). Combined with nonlinear forecasting methods, short and long term risk is thus in this paper forecast. Finally, it shows using daily data, that "risk and dependence" vary on data's calendar time used...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{analyses}} {{are widely used}} tools for supporting decision making. Nonetheless, many criticisms have been raised against the discipline of risk analysis, e. g. technical analyses having a narrow focus, poorly examined claims of the ability of accurately measuring risk and lack of standards for quality assurance and risk analysis evaluation. In response to these criticisms, calls have been made for increased focus on these and other foundational issues, both in the general risk analysis discipline and in the various application areas. This thesis answers these calls for research addressing the underlying concepts and principles of risk analyses, which are approached through applications focusing on the accidental risk of maritime transportation. Focusing first {{on a set of}} foundational issues underlying waterway risk analyses, it is established that many different definitions, perspectives and scientific approaches co-exist in the application area. Through two case studies of reliability of <b>maritime</b> <b>risk</b> models, previous research claiming that risk models provide unreliable decision support, are confirmed for some maritime applications, thus confirming the need for focusing on risk related principles. Subsequently, a set of principles is presented, addressing concepts and terminology, risk and prediction, risk model use and the consideration of uncertainty and bias. A framework is introduced to communicate the scientific principles adhered to in a specific risk analysis. Following this, the principles are translated in two risk analysis frameworks: one for policy-oriented and one for operational risk analysis; the first leading to a quantitative and the second to a qualitative risk characterization. In both, risk is understood as a concept referring to the possible but uncertain occurrence of a situation where something of human value is at stake. Risk models are used as putting forward an argument based on available evidence, as a tool for communication between stakeholders and as a platform for thinking. Uncertainties and value-laden biases are assessed, and some tools for communicating these are introduced. Both frameworks are illustrated by extensive case studies. The first concerns accidental risk of oil spills from tanker collisions in the Gulf of Finland. The second focuses on a risk-informed ship-ship collision alert system. A final issue addressed in the thesis concerns the evaluation of a risk analysis, i. e. principles and criteria for establishing credibility. An integrated framework for this is developed, addressing model use, model plausibility, value-related validity and process-related validity. Specific evaluation criteria are proposed and a selection of these is applied in the presented case studies...|$|E
40|$|Maritime {{transport}} {{is commonly}} categorized {{as one of}} the riskiest industry sectors. In Finnish sea areas, the risks increase during winter navigation when ships have to navigate in sea ice conditions. In order to support and ensure the integrity of people, ships, and environment during winter navigation, different safety and risk management strategies are developed. Risk management aims at developing methods for detecting, analysing, mitigating, and controlling the risks threatening the safety of winter navigation. Safety management aims at establishing and promoting organizational practices for planning, implementing, reviewing, controlling, and improving the safety performance of winter navigation. This thesis provides a review of the current safety performance of winter navigation in Finnish sea areas and proposes alternatives to control and improve it. To this end, the thesis first provides understanding and evidence of the risks threatening the safety of the winter navigation system. Ship collisions during ship independent navigation and ship collisions in convoy operations in medium and severe ice conditions are identified as the accidents with highest risk. These identified contexts are the basis for developing a model that analyses the risk of collision during winter navigation. The model combines the analysis of the role of humans in the execution of the operations and operational aspects of the performance of ships in ice conditions. It is used as a risk management tool that proposes risk control options and assesses their potential efficiency for supporting and improving the safety performance of winter navigation. The assessment of the risk control options points out the need for improving and simplifying safety and risk management in the planning and executing of winter navigation operations. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} coherent safety management systems that would enable practical adoption and application of regulatory demands, ensure their suitability to actual operational needs, and determine coherent safety key performance indicators. Based on this, the thesis offers a method for executing a systematic application and performance measurement of the requirements contained in maritime safety management regulations. Moreover, the thesis introduces a process for designing maritime safety management systems based on a system engineering approach and proposes a tool for reviewing safety performance. Through a case study, these proposed alternatives are combined for designing a safety management system for one of the main responsible actors controlling and ensuring the safety of ship navigation. This case study makes a representation of the advantages in the management of <b>maritime</b> <b>risk</b> and safety, with a special focus on winter navigation...|$|E

Until {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal, the passage around the Cape of Good Hope via Table Bay represented the most important oceanic trading route to the East. The passage, however, became known for its characteristic storms that devastated shipping at Table Bay and developed the area's reputation as the Bay of Storms. This thesis examines the way the British government at the Cape managed the risks associated with using Table Bay and demonstrates how risk is reflected in the historical and archaeological record of Cape Town. Specifically, research will focus on the initial development of the harbor during the Second British occupation at the Cape from 1806 to 1910. This thesis will utilize an amalgamation of social theories pioneered by Anthony Giddens and approaches of risk analysis to examine how risk is incorporated in and reflected by the remains of past societies. A combination of statistical and geo-spatial analyses will be used to reflect the <b>maritime</b> <b>risks</b> of using Table Bay during the selected timeframe.
