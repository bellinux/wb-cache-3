40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to develop}} a PMP {{estimation}} method in a basin-scale by considering both temporal and spatial characteristics and to compare the existing PMP estimation method with the developed method in this study. Since the movement of heavy rainfall is predictable like typhoons, DAD analysis method is usually utilized to storm centered DAD method and fixed areal DAD method. However, utilizing DAD in bigger basin area or longer rainfall duration induces more errors in estimation of average areal rainfall and thus reducing {{the accuracy of the}} results. Therefore, new DAD analysis method is necessary to improve the accuracy. In this study, by utilizing the new DAD analysis method, PMP was estimated through the processes of: firstly, converting point rainfall data to distributed areal rainfall data; secondly, a Grid-based rainfall search method was developed through the utilization of Average Point-tracking; and lastly, the PMP was calculated by considering moisture maximization. PMP estimation from using the new method was compared with the existing PMP as well as the areal <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>precipitation.</b> As a result, even though the new estimate is lower than the exiting PMP, it was larger than the areal <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>precipitation</b> (200 -Year 48 -Hour Areal Rainfall Frequency). Therefore, the estimated PMP can be utilized for the flood estimation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Precipitation</b> (PMP) is {{the maximum}} {{possible}} {{amount of precipitation}} which could occur in a gauging station, a region, or in a watershed. <b>Probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>precipitation</b> is usually estimated by two general methods: the first is synoptic method in which short period (hourly) meteorological parameters such as dew point, wind speed and air pressure are used. The second is statistical method {{which is based on}} the statistical analysis of the 24 -h maximum precipitations. In this study, the amount of 24 -h PMP was estimated by Hershfield, Bethlahmy and modified Bethlahmy methods using date obtained from meteorological and Ministry of Energy over 15 or more years.  The results showed that there exist large differences between statistical and synoptic methods; however, there are rather smaller differences between Bethlahmy and synoptic methods. For modified Bethlahmy method, the results were multiplied by a coefficient of relative humidity. Then the calibrated 24 -h PMP values were estimated for all meteorological stations of Iran and a contour map of 24 -h PMP for the country was developed. Results showed that a minimum value of 24 -h PMP (110 mm) occurred in the central part of country and a maximum amount (260 mm) was found in both south and north parts of Iran...|$|R

The evaluation of the IDF curves allowed to frame the rainfall evolution of the three case studies, considering initially only historical data, then taking into account the climate projections, in order to verify the changes in rainfall patterns.

40|$|The <b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> Flood (PMF) is a {{hypothetical}} flood {{that is considered}} to be the most severe "reasonably possible " at a particular dam location. The UBC Watershed Model (UBCWM) was used to derive the PMF estimates for several BC Hydro dams in Southwestern British Columbia. The UBCWM uses the concept of area-elevation bands and point-input precipitation data. This means that a watershed is split into several elevation bands and the precipitation measured at a point (usually at one or two meteorological stations) is distributed to the elevation bands using the orographic precipitation gradients. However, the <b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Precipitation</b> causing the PMF was provided in a rectangular-grid format of 3. 5 km 2 resolution, and as such could not be used as the UBCWM input.

Storm efficiencies have been determined in a Lagrangian frame of reference for these events and used as input into a storm model to determine the corresponding PMP.

However, runoff processes {{are probably not}} stationary {{in the case of}} a <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> flood (PMF) where discharge greatly exceeds observed flood peaks. Developing hydrodynamic models and using them to build coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic models can potentially improve the plausibility of PMF estimations. This study aims to assess the potential benefits and constraints of coupled modelling compared to standard deterministic hydrologic modelling when it comes to PMF estimation. The two modelling approaches are applied using a set of 100 spatio-temporal <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>precipitation</b> (PMP) distribution scenarios. The resulting hydrographs, the resulting peak discharges as well as the reliability and the plausibility of the estimates are evaluated. The discussion of the results shows that coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models substantially improves the physical plausibility of PMF modelling, although both modelling approaches lead to PMF estimations for the catchment outlet that fall within a similar range.

40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{formulation of}} Hershfield's statistical method for estimating <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>precipitation</b> (PMP) is proposed.

Occasionally causing major loss of property and life, floods are large events of relatively short duration. Makkah area in western Saudi Arabia is characterized by high rainfall intensity that leads to flash floods. This study quantifies the hydrological characteristics and flood probability of some major wadis in western Saudi Arabia, including Na’man, Fatimah, and Usfan. Flood responses in these wadis vary due to the nature and rainfall distribution within these wadis. Rainfall frequency analysis was performed using selected annual maximums of 24 -h rainfall from eight stations located in the area. Two of the most applied methods of statistical distribution, Gumbel’s extreme value distribution and log Pearson type III distribution, were applied to maximum daily rainfall data over 26 to 40 years. The Gumbel’s model was found to be the best fitting model for identifying and predicting future rainfall occurrence.

The most representative and widespread estimation method of PMP is the so-called moisture maximization method. This method maximizes observed storms assuming that the atmospheric moisture would hypothetically rise up to a high value that is regarded as an upper limit and is estimated from historical records of dew points. In this paper, it is argued that fundamental aspects of the method may be flawed or inconsistent. Furthermore, historical time series of dew points and "constructed" time series of maximized precipitation depths (according to the moisture maximization method) are analyzed. The analyses do not provide any evidence of an upper bound either in atmospheric moisture or maximized precipitation depth. Therefore, it is argued that a probabilistic approach is more consistent to the natural behaviour and provides better grounds for estimating extreme precipitation values for design purposes...|$|R
