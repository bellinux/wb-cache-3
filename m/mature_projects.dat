Based on information from 198 MFIs in 65 countries, we show that for-profit MFIs {{are less likely to}} provide financial capital to business start-ups than their not-for-profit counterparts. This results from the adoption of a dominant ‘commercial’ logic by for-profit MFIs, which motivates them to maximize profit by extending loans to less risky ventures with <b>mature</b> <b>projects.</b> In contrast, a dominant ‘development’ logic motivates not-for-profit MFIs to alleviate poverty through supporting the creation of new ventures.

30|$|When {{the models}} {{presented}} herein are used practically, {{it must be}} considered that the resource allocation between early and late activities in the discovery pipeline differ between projects, and in particular between newly founded and <b>mature</b> <b>projects.</b> Assume the life cycle from foundation to termination of a drug discovery enterprise based on only one single project, a so-called pure play company. In the newly founded enterprise, not so many compounds have qualified for preclinical investigations yet. In many cases, the entire outgoing cash flow goes to compound synthesis, i.e. discovery and optimization of leads. Maybe the lead optimization process has not even yet started. The probability of obtaining a compound fit for clinical development must be practically null under these circumstances. However, while the project or company matures, an increasing fraction of the research spending goes to preclinical activities. In this stage of maturity, the prospect of generating compounds fit for clinical development becomes considerable. When the drug discovery pipeline is well-populated with compounds, all four phases are cost drivers and the probability of generating a candidate drug is decent.|$|E
40|$|Statoil is {{implementing}} "Fast Model Update (FMU)," {{an integrated}} and automated workflow for reservoir modeling and characterization. FMU connects all steps and disciplines from seismic depth conversion to prediction and reservoir management {{taking into account}} relevant reservoir uncertainty. FMU delivers an ensemble of geologically-consistent and history-matched model realizations that together characterizes the reservoir uncertainty. FMU facilitates management of the reservoir (e. g. field development plan, well planning, and drainage strategies) in both early-phase as well as <b>mature</b> <b>projects,</b> properly taking geological uncertainty (including structure, facies, and rock/fluid properties) into account. The focus of the paper is to demonstrate how FMU is used in an algorithm for robust optimization of wells (e. g. well targets, infill wells, drilling priority, rate control). In the current paper we demonstrate some early results where the drilling sequence of wells is optimized under geological uncertainty, using an ensemble of models conditioned on all available data. The final product provides an optimized drilling schedule and drilling time. The paper includes examples from one synthetic and one real field application.

40|$|A {{virtual network}} {{laboratory}} —allowing to emulate a physical net-work {{of computers and}} network devices such as switches or routers in software — represents a valuable tool for students, and may also be useful to researchers and system administrators. A tool of this kind, particularly if it aims at being usable by inexperienced stu-dents, should offer the same opportunities of configuring and ex-perimenting with components as a physical network, providing also an intuitive graphical user interface for dynamically manipulating the network topology and each individual virtual device. Building such an inherently concurrent system is nontrivial, re-quiring the integration of many different components written in dif-ferent languages and a complex control logic. Indeed some projects with similar purposes have been existing for years, and typically use scripting languages such as Python and Bash; by contrast our system, Marionnet 1, has been implemented using the functional language OCaml in just six man-months and yet providing several important features still missing in more <b>mature</b> <b>projects.</b> We seize the occasion of describing Marionnet to discuss {{the relevance of the}} functional style and of advanced type systems for dramatically cutting development time...|$|E

40|$|Benchmarking is {{a proven}} {{technique}} for improving project performance and, as such, {{is a critical}} component of any <b>mature</b> <b>project</b> delivery system. Competitive benchmarking requires industry-specific metrics in absolute terms since processes vary by industry, and any metrics used within a single industry must be attuned to its particular processes. A framework is developed for evaluating pharmaceutical capital facility projects using metrics specific to the characteristics of these unique projects. Establishment of the framework made possible the development of a set of industry-specific metrics and a flexible data collection and reporting system for measuring project performance. Preliminary findings from an initial sample of 40 pharmaceutical projects confirm that meaningful industry-specific metrics can be produced for pharmaceutical capital facilities benchmarking. Developing such a framework enables the industry to measure project performance more accurately, get meaningful project performance comparisons, and ultimately establish credible norms for project performance.

40|$|Common sense {{suggests}} that organisations {{are more likely}} to deliver successful projects if they have systems in place that reflect a <b>mature</b> <b>project</b> environment based on a culture of continuous improvement. This paper develops and discusses a Management Maturity Model (MMM) to assess the maturity of project management organisations through a customisable, systematic, strategic and practical methodology inspired from the seminal work of Darwin, Deming, Drucker and Daniel. The model presented is relevant to organisations, such as construction and engineering companies, that prefer to use the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK™ Guide) published by the Project Management Institute (PMI), but without the disadvantages of excessive time and cost commitments and a ‘one size fits all’ approach linked to rigid increments of maturity. It offers a game-changing advance in the application of project-based organisational performance assessment compared to existing market solutions that are unnecessarily complex.

40|$|While {{there has}} been some {{research}} on coordination in FLOSS, such research has focused on coordination within a project or within a group. The area of cross-project coordination, where shared goals are tenuous or non-existent, has been under-researched. This paper explores the question of how multiple projects working on a single piece of existing software in the FLOSS environment can coordinate. Using the Ordering Systems lens, we examine this question via a cross-case analysis of four projects performed on the open source game Jagged Alliance 2 (JA 2) in the forum Bear’s Pit. Our main findings are that: (1) Ongoing cross-project ordering systems are influenced by the materiality of development artifacts. (2) The emergent trajectory of cross-project ordering systems is influenced by affordances that emerge from the interaction between the goals and desires of the project team building the development artifact, and the materiality of the development artifact. (3) When two parties need to coordinate in the ordering system, all or almost all coordination effort can be borne by a single party. Furthermore, over time, emergent FLOSS projects bear more coordination effort than stable, <b>mature</b> <b>projects.</b> Keywords: Cross-project coordination, materiality, ordering systems, open-source * Michael Wade and Kevin Crowston were the accepting senior editors.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two years, our Architecture Program {{committed}} considerable intellectual capital to the rethinking of graduate level introductory design studio pedagogy for students entering our Masters of Architecture 1 / 3 ? year program. This reevaluation concentrates on several unique challenges intrinsic to the graduate level introductory design curriculum, which include: The inherent differences between the age and personality profiles of undergraduate and graduate students. Many programs treat the curricula as equal, with graduate students executing the same exercises as undergraduates, only at a faster pace. The developmental gap {{that exists in the}} second year of most M. Arch 1 programs between students with architecture and non-architecture backgrounds. Our goal is to retool the core design studio pedagogy in order to bring those students with undergraduate degrees in non-architecture disciplines up to the same level of design skill development as I st year graduate students with 4 year Bachelors of Science in Architecture degrees. In short, these incoming students are disciplined, mature and educated and need a highly structured environment that works to: develop skills in design and the conventions of representation; teach theory as a part of everyday studio work instead of a separate activity; and introduce an understanding of design strategy to enable <b>mature</b> <b>projects</b> to emerge more quickly.

40|$|In Product Line Architectures, a {{reference}} architecture {{is designed for}} a family of software systems that share a set of common properties. Variability points are used to capture variations among the different family members. Different product architectures within the family are then derived from the reference architecture based on the set of features chosen for each given product. No methods have been formalized yet on how to derive product architectures from {{a reference}} architecture. This process can, in many cases, be very time consuming especially with large-scale systems comprising thousands of variability points. In this case, manual techniques could become tedious and would introduce a high error margin which makes the need for automation and tool support of high importance. In this presentation we demonstrate a technique for deriving product architectures from an ADLARS described reference architecture using Leopard. ADLARS is an architecture description language that was developed within our research group. ADLARS relates system features to architectural structure: Tasks, Components, and Connectors enabling the generation of product architectures from a reference architecture by specifying the product desired feature set. Leopard is one of the tools within the ADLARS Development Studio, a toolset used for developing and maintaining ADLARS architectures. It is an ADLARS integrated development environment (IDE) and compiler. It can parse ADLARS reference architectures and automatically generate product architectures based on the feature set included.

We introduce the publicly available database, and compare trends and patterns in suspended matter, nutrients and organic matter in the three estuaries. Despite the large differences in suspended particulate matter concentrations between the estuaries, some general relationships can be deduced. Organic matter dynamics is shown {{to be determined by}} sorption onto the particulate matter. This in turn induces a predictable change in bacterial degradability. Floc size, determined by an in situ camera, is a function of organic content, suspended matter concentration and (in a highly non-linear way) salinity. Higher trophic levels in the biological system are negatively affected by the dilution of their food with indigestible particles.
