50|$|According to a 1975 {{study by}} A. J. Velarde, in an unnamed American West Coast city, {{offering}} the client a handjob was a service <b>masseuses</b> {{were employed to}} give. Subsequent newspaper publicity caused by {{public awareness of the}} prevalence of this practice caused local governments to impose licensing requirements on <b>masseuses,</b> similar to the ones imposed on prostitutes. The sexual nature of this licensing led to an attitude that massage parlors would now offer sexual intercourse. <b>Masseuses</b> felt that they had nothing to lose by acting as prostitutes, and because the new regulations classified them as sex workers, <b>masseuses</b> often complied. This gave rise to more prostitution and solicitation in the city.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{focus groups}} for male {{customers}} who frequented Asian massage parlors in San Francisco, {{the present study}} described their sexual and drug use behaviors and attitudes toward practicing safe sex with Asian <b>masseuses.</b> A pervasive view among patrons was that they could engage in sex with <b>masseuses</b> without using a condom if they offered extra money. Their sexual behaviors with Asian <b>masseuses</b> were influenced by perceptions about vulnerability toward HIV/STIs, substance use behaviors, and masseuses’ initiation of condom use, which was often governed by unspoken rules at parlors. Customers perceived massage parlors as being a safe place compared with street sex venues. Some customers sought emotional attachment with Asian <b>masseuses</b> and expressed stereotypical views toward them as being docile and submissive. Culturally appropriate HIV/STI prevention programs (e. g., communication about and practicing 100 % condom use) are needed to target both customers and Asian <b>masseuses</b> at multiple levels (individual, owner/manager, work environment, and community levels). Also, customers’ and masseuses’ perceptions toward relationships at massage parlors and power dynamics need further investigation to promote safe work environments and 100 % condom use at massage parlors...|$|R

Caroline Munro, who can be seen very briefly as one of Dr Noah's gun-toting guards, received the role of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. Milton Reid, who appears in a bit part as the temple guard, opening the door to Mata Bond's hall, played one of Dr. No's guards and Stromberg's underling, Sandor, in The Spy Who Loved Me.

New legislation is needed to provide legal protection to <b>masseuses...</b>|$|R

In June 2017, Choe was invited by Goldman Properties to paint a mural on the Houston Bowery Wall in New York City, which would be up until October.

25|$|Rose, who {{had begun}} to engage in {{prostitution}} by this time, explained to Owens that {{she worked as a}} <b>masseuse</b> when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her. According to Owens, Fred also said he was a skilled abortionist, who was available should she ever need such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward. When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests' overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.|$|E

Japanese immigrations had also been in the Kingdom of Sarawak since 1915 for the same purposes with some of them working as hawkers and some Japanese women as <b>masseuse</b> in red-light district.

The offer was accepted and by November 1914, 50 women had been placed in military hospitals. At this time the demand for physiotherapy (or Massage and Electrical Treatment as it was known) increased and the Pagets were asked to open a day centre in London to relieve pressure on the military hospitals in London. Lady Alexander Paget offered her house at 55 Portland Place and soon over 200 men were being seen at the clinic seen every day. By now the number of women employed in the corps was over 200 and soon they became attached to the staff of most military hospitals with a further 120 <b>masseuses</b> employed.|$|R
