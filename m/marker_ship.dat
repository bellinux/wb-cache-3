Tempōzan—literally Tempō (era) mountain—was an {{approximately}} 20-meter high man-made hill created in 1831 (year 2 of the Tempō era) through the dredging of the adjacent Ajigawa River.

Realizing the value of publicity, Weeks was prepared to scale the tower (it was solid), and camp on it in protest. But as Weeks admitted many years later: “I started to climb, but after about 30 feet I realized I had no head for heights! Rather embarrassed I abandoned my attempt. The beautiful structure of brick and stone was demolished.” ...|$|R

After a period of French-British operation the lighthouse concession passed to a British company, then to Yemen.|$|R
50|$|Mount Tenpō {{was formed}} in 1831 (Tenpō year 2) as the deposit for earth dug up from {{dredging}} the Ajigawa river to allow easier access to Osaka for large ships and to prevent floods. The mountain had an elevation of about 20 meters at the time, {{and served as a}} <b>marker</b> for <b>ships</b> entering the Ajigawa river to head to the city of Osaka. Cherry blossom and pine trees were planted on the mountain as people began to set up shops in the area, and the mountain gradually became the visitor attraction that it is now. Images of children playing in this area were sketched in ukiyo-e by Utagawa Hiroshige and other artists.|$|R

50|$|The {{main part}} of the game occurs during the action phase. Here the armies can move, attack, create fortifications, or disband. A player {{performs}} actions with their armies and heroes one at a time, with all actions being performed before moving to another marker. Land armies can move through up to 3 areas in a turn (or 4 if they are all cavalry). Fleets can move up to 6 areas, but can never enter a land area. <b>Ship</b> <b>markers</b> can be used to carry troops that are in a port, and can unload them along a coast or on an island.|$|R
50|$|In Stellar conquest, at the {{beginning}} of a game, each player starts in an opposite corner of the board, each with a number of <b>markers</b> that represent <b>ships</b> of various types. For the first four turns the corner square counts as a populated planet. In addition, all ships may move only two spaces, but it is possible to purchase movement upgrades that improve the rate of travel speed.Units must follow the quickest path to a named destination, and their destination can be changed only when the route causes the unit to stop on a star hex. The distance that ships of any type may travel will not precede more than eight hexes away from a populated planet that is owned by the same player; this limitation can be rescinded by research.|$|R
5000|$|In the past, the island, {{formerly}} known as Saiban,was an important navigational <b>marker</b> for the <b>shipping</b> lanes that passed nearby. [...] Historically, the Ottoman Empire controlled the Red Sea islands, and granted a French company a lighthouse concession. British forces occupied the island in 1915, but sovereignty was deliberately left indeterminate. After a period of French-British operation the lighthouse concession passed to a British company, then to Yemen. [...] Sovereignty of the island was long disputed among Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Yemen. Under a 1962 agreement, lighthouses were maintained on the island {{at the cost of}} shippers. In 1973, Yemen had notified Ethiopia of its intent to perform an aerial survey, and an ambiguous response by Ethiopia was later a point of contention; Ethiopia designated the islands in the area as having [...] "no recognized owner".The dispute, after Eritrea's 1993 independence from Ethiopia, erupted into the 1995 Hanish islands crisis regarding the Hanish Islands and Zuqar Island.A 1998-99 international case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration awarded various islands to Eritrea and Yemen respectively.|$|R
40|$|According to {{previous}} studies and anecdotal evidence {{there are a}} lot of lost lobster traps at the Saba Bank. One study estimated the loss to be between 210 and 795 lobster traps per year. The Saba Bank is an approximately 2, 200 km 2 submerged area and spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) is one of the main fisheries with an annual economic value over USD 1 million. The traps get lost due to a combination of bad weather moving or damaging traps and <b>marker</b> buoy lines, <b>ship</b> traffic running into and cutting marker buoy lines and removal of marker buoy or theft of traps by vandals. Lost traps are a concern for the Saba Bank fisheries management, because of the potential impact of ghost fishing by lost traps and the damage to the benthic environment. IMARES was commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation to advise on a method to detect lost lobster traps. The objective of this desk study was to provide information for the sustainable management of the lobster fisheries and the conservation of the Saba Bank. In this report we investigate the most efficient method for the detection of lost lobster traps from a small vessel in water between 15 and 50 meter depth. We not only address methods for the location of traps, but also recommend methods for the retrieval of traps and measurement of ghost fishing. Side scan sonar in combination with a magnetometer is recommended as the best, most efficient method to locate lost lobster traps in order to retrieve them. This is not necessarily the most cost-efficient method to respond to the problem of future traps loss, as preventive measures tend to be more effective and less costly than curative measures. However, a detection survey can be used to better estimate the magnitude of the problem of already lost traps. It is not realistic that a detection survey can locate all lost traps that are present on the Saba Bank...|$|R
