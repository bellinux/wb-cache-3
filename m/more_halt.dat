5000|$|Meanwhile, Will's mentor, Halt, has {{sworn to}} save him from the Skandians, but the Ranger Corps forces him to stay back. Halt, however, is so desperate, he insults the King of his country, Araluen. The King and Halt are good friends, so in Halt's trial, the King takes pity on Halt. Instead of the normal punishment, which is to ban the {{defendant}} from the Araluen borders forever, he banishes Halt from the borders only for one year. Halt is banished from the Ranger Corps until the punishment is lifted, {{that is just a}} minor problem for Halt. He then sets out to find his apprentice once <b>more.</b> <b>Halt</b> is determined to get to Skandia quickly, so he takes the quickest route: Gallica. There he meets Will's old friend, Horace. Horace is Will's childhood friend, and just like Will, Horace is an orphan. In Gallica, Horace and Halt tried to go as fast as they could, but they were stopped by a lot of inexperienced knights. Horace, being a warrior apprentice, takes on the fake name [...] "The Oakleaf Knight". Horace beats all of them with ease without his grizzled companion, Halt, to step in. Horace's reputation grows until he is noticed throughout Gallica, which attracts the horrible knight, Deparnieux of Castle Montsombre. Deparnieux soon captures Horace and Halt.|$|E

50|$|Prisoners {{destined for}} the prison were no longer {{conveyed}} by the route after 1930 except during and just after World War 2, as the Southern Railway route to Tavistock and a road connection were <b>more</b> convenient.Two <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> (King Tor and Ingra Tor) were opened (in 1928 and 1936 respectively) to counter competition from local bus services and encourage tourist traffic.|$|R
50|$|Some {{think that}} SCT and ADHD produce two {{different}} kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the attentional style in SCT may be <b>more</b> <b>halting</b> and sluggish, whereas in ADHD it is jumpy and flighty.|$|R

She returned to Hawaii on 28 July after a visit to Hong Kong, China, resuming her duty of supplying Central and South Pacific bases. On 23 February 1959, she was ordered for inactivation, and was decommissioned on 24 July 1959, and transferred to the Hellenic Navy under the Military Assistance Program. She was struck from the Naval Register on 1 August 1959, and she was renamed as HNS Arethovsa (A-377).|$|R

25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much <b>more</b> <b>halting</b> and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and she still had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|R
30|$|Twin {{formation}} in regions of relatively low dislocation density (Additional file 2 : Video 2 and Kasama et al. 2010) progresses smoothly. In contrast, twin {{formation in}} dislocation-rich regions (Additional file 1 : Video 1) appears <b>more</b> <b>halting,</b> moving {{almost in a}} stick–slip manner. Dislocation stress fields are strongest immediately adjacent to the dislocations (Stacey and Wise 1967; Xu and Merrill 1989; Moskowitz 1993). These likely affect twin propagation by causing small-scale variations in T_v. It {{is also possible that}} the dislocations, if appropriately aligned, would physically impede twin propagation. Dislocation structures cause additional subdivisions within the sample that must each independently nucleate and develop monoclinic magnetite. Additional file 1 : Video 1 and Fig.  1 illustrate such dislocation-bounded twin structures. Additional file 2 : Video 2 and Fig.  2, however, demonstrate that smaller more sparsely distributed dislocations are less likely to have the same degree of influence on twin formation and arrangement.|$|R

50|$|A {{machine with}} an oracle for the halting problem can {{determine}} whether particular Turing machines will halt on particular inputs, but they cannot determine, in general, whether machines equivalent to themselves will halt.

2500|$|When Genie {{first moved}} in with the Riglers she still {{scratched}} and cut herself when angry, and researchers wrote that her speech was much <b>more</b> <b>halting</b> and hesitant than Butler had described. She infrequently spoke, and for reasons they could not discern she almost always a several minutes delay in her responses to speech. Typically she {{did not seem to}} listen to anyone unless she was being directly addressed and typically walked away from somebody who was speaking to her, and while she would stay with someone if specifically asked she rarely seemed attuned to what the person was saying. In contrast to Butler's writings the scientists wrote that Genie only rarely used two-word sentences, and prior to [...] October 1971 they were all modifier-noun sentences, sentences indicating possession—none containing the possessive [...] 's [...] marker—or the two words of a compound noun such as [...] "number five". For the first few months linguists did not record any utterances longer than two words, and wrote that she did not use any negative sentences.|$|R
