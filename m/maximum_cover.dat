In the <b>maximum</b> <b>cover</b> problem, we {{are given}} a {{collection}} of sets over a ground set of elements and a positive integer w, and we are asked to compute a collection of at most w sets whose union contains {{the maximum number of}} elements from the ground set. This is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with applications to resource allocation. We study the simplest APX-hard variant of the problem where all sets are of size at most 3 and we present a 6 / 5 -approximation algorithm, improving the previously best known approximation guarantee. Our algorithm is based on the idea of first computing a large packing of disjoint sets of size 3 and then augmenting it by performing simple local improvements. ...|$|E
40|$|Ephemeral {{plants in}} the {{southern}} part of Gurbantunggut Desert were systematically monitored from 2002 to 2004 and the meteorological data and soil moisture during the same period were analyzed. The results show that the ephemeral plants germination and growth are sensitive to the changes of water and heat condition. The time for daily temperature over 0 degrees C in early spring in 2003 was delayed nearly 10 d compared with that in 2002, while the soil water changed little in the same period. Observation showed that there were 28 ephemeral species germinated in 2002, their life period was about 70 d in spring, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>cover</b> of ephemeral synusia reached 46. 4 %. However, only 17 ephemeral species germinated in 2003, their life period was about 50 d in spring, and their <b>maximum</b> <b>cover</b> was only 20. 8 %. The height of ephemeral plants was significantly higher in 2002 than that in 2003. It can be seen that ephemeral plant germination and growth in spring are strongly dependent on temperature. The changes of water conditions can affect ephemerals germination and growth as well. Because no heavy precipitation occurred during summer in 2002, only a few ephemerophytes were observed in autumn after ephemerals completed their life circle in early spring. However, about 60 mm precipitation was recorded from July to August both in 2003 and in 2004. Some ephemerals such as Erodium oxyrrhynchum and Carex physodes, etc. covered the dune surface rapidly with a cover > 10 %. Therefore, the ephemerals not only germinate in autumn after the early spring, some species may germinate in summer if adequate rainfall occurs. The study on responses of ephemerals growth to water and heat conditions not only has a certain ecological significance but also contributes a better understanding to the effect of climate changes on the desert surface stability...|$|E

40|$|Group-based {{sparsity}} {{models are}} proven instrumental in linear regression problems for recovering signals from much fewer measurements than standard compressive sensing. The main promise {{of these models}} is the recovery of “interpretable ” signals along with the identification of their constituent groups. To this end, we establish a combinatorial framework for group-model selection problems and highlight the underlying tractability issues revolving around such notions of interpretability when the regression matrix is simply the identity operator. We show that, in general, claims of correctly identifying the groups with convex relaxations would lead to polynomial time solution algorithms for a well-known NP-hard problem, called the weighted <b>maximum</b> <b>cover</b> problem. Instead, leveraging a graph-based understanding of group models, we describe group structures which enable correct model identification in polynomial time via dynamic programming. We also show that group structures that lead to totally unimodular constraints have tractable discrete as well as convex relaxations. Finally, we study the Pareto frontier of budgeted group-sparse approximations for the tree-based sparsity model and illustrate identification and computation trade-offs between our framework and the existing convex relaxations...|$|E

Very promising solutions are optical 3 D, in addition to surface measurement. Here, an algorithm is presented to separate local defects from the surface and the noise (measurement error and surface roughness) with a given manufacturer's risk for piecewise smooth surfaces. The algorithm consists of a feature enhancement by means of special wavelets and thresholding and interpolation schemes to recover a defect- and noise-free surface and subsequently the extension {{and shape of the}} defects in all directions with reduced random errors. The limits of the algorithm such as accuracy, sensitivity, <b>maximum</b> <b>cover</b> rate of the surface with defects and rotation and translation invariance are shown theoretically and by numerical simulations. Experimentally, nanoindents are measured by means of confocal microscopy, and a reduction of the random errors by one order of magnitude is observed.
