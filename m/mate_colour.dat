25|$|Colour change permits {{camouflage}} against different backgrounds. In {{the context}} of deception, this {{can be used as}} a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and <b>mating.</b> <b>Colour</b> change is made possible by chromatophores; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Inside the chromatophore cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.|$|R
50|$|The zebra mbuna is a {{maternal}} mouth brooding cichlid. The female broods {{the eggs}} and early stage young in her mouth for 18 to 24 days. During this time she is unable to feed and she loses weight. When mature enough, the fry are expelled into the open water and quickly find natural shelter in which to hide. A study by Pierottia et al. (2008) investigated whether the colour morph of the female influenced the male's choice of mate.

40|$|The {{polymorphic}} {{coral reef}} fish genus Hypoplectrus (hamlets) {{provides an excellent}} system for examining {{the initial stages of}} natural biological divergence in the expansive marine environment. Despite close genetic similarities, hamlets occur in assortatively <b>mating</b> <b>colour</b> morphotypes. In this study, we determined whether ecological differences exist between morphs that could reinforce the assortative mating pattern within morphs. We compared the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope dietary signatures of 6 hamlet morphotypes from 5 geographically distant locations. Across 364 individuals, and with the exception of fish sampled in the Gulf of Mexico, no significant isotopic associations with morphotype were detected. Our results therefore provide no evidence that different hamlet morphs are associated with distinct dietary niches, despite finding highly significant geographical differentiation for both isotopes. We argue that tight assortative mating without ecological divergence could be maintained through the demands of reciprocal cooperation within a reproductive pattern of simultaneous hermaphroditism which characterises all hamlets...|$|R

40|$|Blue–green colours in avian eggs {{have been}} {{proposed}} as post-mating signals of female phenotypic quality to their <b>mates.</b> Egg <b>colour</b> may not only indicate female value, but also {{the quality of the}} eggs themselves and of resulting offspring. To date, there has been no demonstration of an association between egg colour and egg or offspring immune quality. We here show that the intensity of blue–green colour of pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca eggs reflects the amount of maternal antibodies in the yolk, a form of passive immunity crucial for offspring performance. Moreover, egg colour predicts fledging success. Also, incubating females in better condition lay more colourful eggs. The immunoglobulin level in incubating females is positively associated with that in the eggs. These results support the signalling hypothesis of eggshell coloration, underlining its role as an indicator of trans-generational transmission of immune defences in birds. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 47 - 50). Comprehensive morphometric {{measurements and}} counts, external colouration, reproductive behaviour and diet of steentjies (Spondyliosoma emarginatum) in Langebaan Lagoon were recorded between September 2004 and February 2005. Sagittal otoliths were extracted and age estimates recorded from both whole and sectioned otoliths {{in order to}} estmate growth and mortality parameters. A total of 302 steentjies (139 - 312 mm fork length) was sampled of which 243 were females, 55 were males and four were individuals with hermaphroditic gonads. Macroscopic and microscopic examination of gonads and monthly gonadosomtic indices suggest a spring spawning season and that steentjies are protgynous hermaphrodites with males significantly than females (t = 64. 75, df = 301, p < 0. 001). During the reproductive season, males develop a blue colouration. All males with this colouration had testes classified as either active or ripe and had significantly larger gonad masses than those without <b>mating</b> <b>colours</b> (U = 3. 5, Z = 6. 48, p $lt; 0. 001). The length-at- 50 %-maturity for females was 171 mm (FL) and for males was 204 mm (FL). The size at 50 % sex change was estimted as 250 mm (FL). Analysis of foregut contents showed steentjies to be opportunitistic ominivores, changing from plant to animal food as they age. The average percent error and coefficient of variation values for whole otoliths were 4. 59 % and 6. 00 % respectively, and 10. 89 % and 14. 53 % for sectioned otoliths. Although {{the result of the}} whole otolith study provided more precise age estimates, there was a strong indication of bias so the sectioned otolith results were used for calculating the growth model. Growth (by sex) was modelled using a model developed for sex changing sparids that allows for accelerated growth after sex change. Steentjies appear to have shorter life spans than most sparids; the oldest individuals sampled attaining less than 7 years of age. Growth rates appear to be relatively high. The smallest, youngest fish were all female, with males only present in the larger size classes. The estimated mortality for steentjies was 0. 7 y[- 1]. Such a high mortality rate implies that further increase in fishing pressure on this species may not be sustainable in Langebaan Lagoon...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that female Gouldian finches from Northern Australia can control the sex of their {{offspring}} by choosing mates according to their head color. A certain amount of genetic incompatibility between black and red-headed birds can result in high mortality (up to 80%) in female offspring when birds of different head <b>colours</b> <b>mate.</b> If the female mates with a finch of different head colour, this genetic incompatibility can be addressed by over-producing sons, up to a ratio of four males to one female.

40|$|Colour polymorphisms have fascinated {{evolutionary}} ecologists {{for a long}} time. Yet, {{knowledge on}} the mechanisms that allow their persistence is restricted {{to a handful of}} well-studied cases. We studied two species of Lake Victoria cichlid fish, Neochromis omnicaeruleus and Neochromis greenwoodi, exhibiting very similar sex-linked colour polymorphisms. The ecology and behaviour of one of these species is well studied, with colour-based mating and aggression preferences. Here, we ask whether the selection potentially resulting from female and male mating preferences and aggression biases reduces gene flow between the colour morphs and permits differentiation in traits other than colour. Over the past 14 years, the frequencies of colour morphs have somewhat oscillated, but there is no evidence for directional change, suggesting the colour polymorphism is persistent on an ecological timescale. We find limited evidence of ecomorphological differentiation between sympatric ancestral (plain) and derived (blotched) colour morphs. We also find significantly nonrandom genotypic assignment and an excess of linkage disequilibrium in the plain morph, which together with previous information on mating preferences suggests nonrandom <b>mating</b> between <b>colour</b> morphs. This, together with negative frequency-dependent sexual selection, found in previous studies, may facilitate maintenance of these polymorphisms in sympatr...|$|R
60|$|But fruit-eating and flower-feeding creatures, like {{butterflies}} and humming-birds--seeking their food ever among the bright berries and brilliant flowers, almost invariably acquire {{in the long}} run an æsthetic taste for pure and varied colouring, and by the aid of sexual selection this taste stereotypes itself at last in their own wings and plumage. They choose their <b>mates</b> for <b>colour</b> as they choose their foodstuffs. Hence all the larger and more gregarious parrots, in which the need for concealment is less, tend to diversify the fundamental green of their coats with crimson, yellow, or blue, which in some cases take possession of the entire body. The largest kinds of all, like the great blue and yellow or crimson macaws, are as gorgeous as Solomon in all his glory: and they are also the species least afraid of enemies; for in Brazil you may often see them wending their way homeward openly in pairs every evening, with as little attempt at concealment as rooks in England. In the Moluccas and New Guinea, says Mr. Wallace, white cockatoos and gorgeous lories in crimson and blue are the very commonest objects in the local fauna. Even the New Zealand owl-parrot, however, still retains many traces of his original greenness, mixed with the dirty brown and dingy yellow of his acquired nocturnal and burrowing nature.|$|R

40|$|Colour is an {{important}} factor in food detection and acquisition by animals using visually based foraging. Colour can be used to identify the suitability of a food source or improve the efficiency of food detection, and can even be linked to <b>mate</b> choice. Food <b>colour</b> preferences are known to exist, but whether these preferences are heritable and how these preferences evolve is unknown. Using the freshwater fish Poecilia reticulata, we artificially selected for chase behaviour towards two different-coloured moving stimuli: red and blue spots. A response to selection was only seen for chase behaviours towards the red, with realized heritabilities ranging from 0. 25 to 0. 30. Despite intense selection, no significant chase response was recorded for the blue-selected lines. This lack of response may be due to the motion-detection mechanism in the guppy visual system and may have novel implications for the evolvability of responses to colour-related signals. The behavioural response to several colours after five generations of selection suggests that the colour opponency system of the fish may regulate the response to selection...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of male {{coloration}} on interspeciÆc female mate choice in two closely related species of haplochromine cichlids from Lake Victoria. The species differ primarily in male coloration. Males of one species are red, {{those of the other}} are blue. We re- corded the behavioral responses of females to males of both species in paired male trials under white light and under monochromatic light, under which the interspecific differences in coloration were masked. Females of both species exhibited species-assortative <b>mate</b> choice when <b>colour</b> differences were visible, but chose non-assortatively when colour differences were masked by light conditions. Neither male behaviour nor overall female response frequencies differed between light treatments. That female preferences could be altered by manipulating the perceived colour pattern implies that the colour itself is used in interspecific mate choice, rather than other characters. Hence, male coloration in haplochromine cichlids does underlie sexual selection by direct mate choice, involving the capacity for individual assessment of potential mates by the female. Females of both species responded more frequently to blue males under monochromatic light. Blue males were larger and displayed more than red males. This implies a hierarchy of choice criteria. Females may use male display rates, size, or both when colour is unavailable. Where available, colour has gained dominance over other criteria. This may explain rapid speciation by sexual selection on male coloration, as proposed in a recent mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|Correlated {{traits are}} {{important}} from an evolutionary perspective as natural selection acting on one trait may indirectly affect other traits. Further, {{the response to}} selection can be constrained or hastened {{as a result of}} correlations. Because mating behaviour and body colour can dramatically affect fitness, a correlation between them can have important fitness ramifications. In this work, melanic (black) male mosquitofishes (Gambusia holbrooki) with temperature-sensitive body-colour expression are bred in captivity. Half of the sons of each melanic sire are reared at 19 degrees C (and express a black body colour) and half are reared at 31 degrees C (and express a silver body colour). The two colour morphs are placed in the same social setting and monitored for behavioural differences. <b>Mating</b> behaviour and <b>colour</b> are correlated traits. Mating behaviour differs markedly between the two phenotypes, despite high genetic relatedness. Melanic (black) phenotypes are more aggressive towards females, chasing them and attempting more matings than their silver siblings. Females avoid melanic-male mating attempts more than silver-male mating attempts. When males with temperature-sensitive colour expression are melanic and aggressive, they probably experience a very different selective regime in nature from when they are silver and less aggressive. Under some conditions (e. g. predation), melanic coloration and/or aggression is advantageous compared with silver coloration and/or less aggressive behaviour. However, under different conditions (e. g. high-frequency melanism), melanism and/or aggression appears to be disadvantageous and melanic males have reduced survival and reproduction. Selective advantages to each morph under different conditions may enable the long-term persistence of this temperature-sensitive genotype...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Research on the {{evolution}} of reproductive isolation in African cichlid fishes has largely focussed on the role of male <b>colours</b> and female <b>mate</b> choice. Here, we tested predictions from the hypothesis that allopatric divergence in male colour is associated with corresponding divergence in preference. Methods We studied four populations of the Lake Malawi Pseudotropheus zebra complex. We predicted that more distantly-related populations that independently evolved similar colours would interbreed freely while more closely-related populations with different <b>colours</b> <b>mate</b> assortatively. We used microsatellite genotypes or mesh false-floors to assign paternity. Fisher's exact tests as well as Binomial and Wilcoxon tests were used to detect if mating departed from random expectations. Results Surprisingly, laboratory mate choice experiments revealed significant assortative mating not only between population pairs with differently coloured males, but between population pairs with similarly-coloured males too. This suggested that assortative mating could be based on non-visual cues, so we further examined the sensory basis of assortative mating between two populations with different male colour. Conducting trials under monochromatic (orange) light, intended to mask the distinctive male dorsal fin hues (blue v orange) of these populations, did not significantly affect the assortative mating by female P. emmiltos observed under control conditions. By contrast, assortative mating broke down when direct contact between female and male was prevented. Conclusion We suggest that non-visual cues, such as olfactory signals, may {{play an important role in}} mate choice and behavioural isolation in these and perhaps other African cichlid fish. Future speciation models aimed at explaining African cichlid radiations may therefore consider incorporating such mating cues in mate choice scenarios. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sympatry of multiple, interbreeding colour morphs {{within a}} single {{population}} requires equilibrium between the various agents of selection acting on alternative colour morphs. This colour polymorphism {{is an area of}} growing interest in evolutionary biology as it contradicts many assumptions of natural and sexual selection. Owing to the strong role of colour in intraspecific communication, sexual selection is a primary candidate for balancing selection and its potential is supported by a growing body of both empirical and theoretical evidence. We examined patterns of mate choice in the ornate rainbowfish, Rhadinocentrus ornatus, a small freshwater fish species from the wallum habitat of east coast Australia, to see whether nonrandom <b>mating</b> contributes to <b>colour</b> polymorphism maintenance in this system. Populations from Fraser Island and the adjacent mainland comprise a common blue morph and a rare red morph. These colour morphs are present in both males and females, with red individuals accounting for approximately 18 % of the individuals in our focal population from Fraser Island. In dichotomous laboratory mate choice experiments, we found that female R. ornatus preferred males of the opposite colour morph to themselves, a mating pattern known as negative assortative mating, which may provide indirect benefits to females through the generation of outbred offspring. In contrast, males preferred red females irrespective of their own colour morph, suggesting females may possess red morph-specific traits that are the target of sexual selection by males. Our findings support an emerging pattern that suggests that multiple selection pressures may interact to maintain alternative colour morphs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{diversity}} of visual systems in fish {{has long been}} of interest for evolutionary biologists and neurophysiologists, and has recently begun {{to attract the attention}} of molecular evolutionary geneticists. Several recent studies on the copy number and genomic organization of visual pigment proteins, the opsins, have revealed an increased opsin diversity in fish relative to most vertebrates, brought about through recent instances of opsin duplication and divergence. However, for the subfamily of opsin genes that mediate vision at the long-wavelength end of the spectrum, the LWS opsins, it appears that most fishes possess only one or two loci, a value comparable to most other vertebrates. Here, we characterize the LWS opsins from cDNA of an individual guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a fish that is known exhibit variation in its long-wavelength sensitive visual system, <b>mate</b> preferences and <b>colour</b> patterns. Results We identified six LWS opsins expressed within a single individual. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these opsins descend from duplication events both pre-dating and following the divergence of the guppy lineage from that of the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, the closest species for which comparable data exists. Numerous amino acid substitutions exist among these different LWS opsins, many at sites known to be important for visual pigment function, including spectral sensitivity and G-protein activation. Likelihood analyses using codon-based models of evolution reveal significant changes in selective constraint along two of the guppy LWS opsin lineages. Conclusion The guppy displays an unusually high number of LWS opsins compared to other fish, and to vertebrates in general. Observing both substitutions at functionally important sites and the persistence of lineages across species boundaries suggests that these opsins might have functionally different roles, especially with regard to G-protein activation. The reasons why are currently unknown, but may relate to aspects of the guppy's behavioural ecology, in which both male colour patterns and the female mate preferences for these colour patterns experience strong, highly variable selection pressures. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Intense {{competition}} {{for access to}} females can lead to males exploiting different components of sexual selection, and result {{in the evolution of}} alternative mating strategies (AMSs). Males of Poecilia parae, a colour polymorphic fish, exhibit five distinct phenotypes: drab-coloured (immaculata), striped (parae), structural-coloured (blue) and carotenoid-based red and yellow morphs. Previous work indicates that immaculata males employ a sneaker strategy, whereas the red and yellow morphs exploit female preferences for carotenoid-based <b>colours.</b> <b>Mating</b> strategies favouring the maintenance of the other morphs remain to be determined. Here, we report the role of agonistic male-male interactions in influencing female mating preferences and male mating success, and in facilitating the evolution of AMSs. Results Our study reveals variation in aggressiveness among P. parae morphs during indirect and direct interactions with sexually receptive females. Two morphs, parae and yellow, use aggression to enhance their mating success (i. e., number of copulations) by 1) directly monopolizing access to females, and 2) modifying female preferences after winning agonistic encounters. Conversely, we found that the success of the drab-coloured immaculata morph, which specializes in a sneak copulation strategy, relies in its ability to circumvent both male aggression and female choice when facing all but yellow males. Conclusions Strong directional selection is expected to deplete genetic variation, yet many species show striking genetically-based polymorphisms. Most studies evoke frequency dependent selection to explain the persistence of such variation. Consistent with a growing body of evidence, our findings suggest that a complex form of balancing selection may alternatively explain the evolution and maintenance of AMSs in a colour polymorphic fish. In particular, this study demonstrates that intrasexual competition results in phenotypically distinct males exhibiting clear differences in their levels of aggression to exclude potential sexual rivals. By being dominant, the more aggressive males are able to circumvent female mating preferences for attractive males, whereas another male type incorporates subordinate behaviours that allow them to circumvent male aggression and female mating preferences. Together, these and previous results indicate that exploiting different aspects of social interactions may allow males to evolve distinct mating strategies and thus the long term maintenance of polymorphisms within populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Birds use {{colour vision}} for many biologically {{relevant}} behaviours such as foraging and <b>mate</b> choice. Bird <b>colour</b> vision is mediated by {{four types of}} single cones, giving them an extra dimension of colour information compared to trichromatic humans. The cone photoreceptors of birds have coloured oil droplets that are assumed to increase the discriminability of colours in bright light {{at the cost of}} dim light sensitivity. In this thesis I present four studies where we have trained chickens to perform colour discrimination and tested the limits of their behavioural performance. In paper I we tested how small colour differences chickens can discriminate. This allowed us to test the predictions of the most well established model for bird colour vision, the receptor noise limited model. There was a reasonably good fit between model and behaviour. Furthermore, we tested in how dim light chickens could discriminate colours and found that the intensity threshold was affected by the colour difference between the stimuli and their intensity. In Paper II we continued testing colour discrimination in dim light and tested the hypothesis that chickens sum the signals from many photoreceptors to increase contrast sensitivity at the cost of spatial resolution in dim light, so called spatial pooling. We used food containers covered with larger, smaller, more or fewer colour patches. Supporting the hypothesis, the containers covered by more colour could be discriminated in dimmer light. In Paper III we tested colour constancy, the ability to maintain colour perception in different spectral illuminations that would otherwise confuse colour perception. Our aim was to find the largest illumination change that chicken colour constancy could tolerate. We found that chicken colour constancy could tolerate larger illumination changes when discriminating stimuli that were more different from each other. In paper IV we continued the work on colour constancy but allowed the chickens to use relative colour learning, which was specifically excluded in paper III. In Paper IV we found that their colour constancy could tolerate larger illumination changes. In nature relative colour cues are available and may be an important aspect of colour learning and perception. These results suggest that such cues can make colour constancy more robust to larger illumination changes. In both experiments chicken colour constancy was improved if they were adapted for 5 minutes in the tested illumination before performing the discrimination task. We compared the illuminations for which chickens retained colour constancy, to the difference between natural illuminations and we can conclude that chickens are well equipped to maintain accurate colour perception when changing between habitats in the wild. Objects are detected both by their chromatic and achromatic contrasts. The receptor noise limited model can be used to predict discriminability through both chromatic and achromatic vision. To use the model reliably its assumptions and predictions must be compared to behavioural results. This has been done for the chromatic version of the model but not the achromatic. In Paper V we compiled all known chromatic and achromatic contrast detection thresholds, and used them to derive the limiting noise level to be used when predicting visual discrimination in a range of animals. We discuss the limitations of using modelling in the wild such as the need to consider the spatial pattern of the stimuli and the light intensities in which the modelling occurs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} genetic relationships of allopatric populations of the cichlid fish, Tilapia sparrmanii (A. Smith 1840) inhabiting the sinkholes and springs of the North West Province, South Africa. It also examined the genetic relationships of T sparrmanii to its polychromatic sister species, Tilapia guinasana (Trewavas 1936) which is endemic to the Guinas sinkhole in Namibia. Finally, the study investigated {{whether there is a}} genetic basis for T guinasana's colour polymorphism. The research was prompted by the concern of conservation authorities about the possible loss of unique fauna given the high demand for use of the subterranean waters for agricultural, domestic and industrial purposes. Such demands have the potential to drain these habitats. Further concerns related to habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species in the ecosystems inhabited by both fish species. Three approaches were adopted in attempting to answer the above questions. First was the investigation of Sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) -Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) of total cellular proteins as a fast and relatively inexpensive indicator of genetic relatedness between the fish populations. Secondly, genetic differentiation between the T sparrmanii populations and its relationship to T guinasana were assayed using restriction endonuclease analysis of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -amplified regions of the cytochrome b gene and the d-Ioop of mitochondrial DNA, coupled with Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) analysis of the same regions. The third approach involved the use of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting of the populations ofT sparrmanii as an indicator of genetic differentiation between them. RAPD fingerprinting was further used to investigate the genetic relationships between T sparrmanii and T guinasana and to probe the genetic basis of the polychromatism of the latter. SDS-PAGE did not reveal any genetic differentiation between the T sparrmanii populations, nor could the analysis detect variation within them. It however clearly distinguished at a species level between T sparrmanii and T guinasana as well as between these and other fish species, thus indicating its possible utility as an indicator of genetic relatedness at a species level. Mitochondrial studies employing the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -amplified cytochrome b (1. 1 kb) and d-Ioop regions (0. 9 kb) with six and five restriction enzymes respectively, failed to reveal genetic differences within and between the allopatric populations. TGGE of 500 bp of the d-Ioop and 400 bp of the 12 sRNA PCR-amplified fragments did not reveal any differences between the populations of T. sparrmanii, nor did the analysis reveal any differences between T. sparrmanii and T. guinasana. The lack of differentiation between the T. sparrmanii populations by these mitochondrial Dna analysis techniques, despite habitat fragmentation, indicated a recent origin of the populations from a common ancestral population. Failure to distinguish between T. sparrmanii and T. guinasana {{may be related to the}} sensitivity of the techniques utilized. RAPD fingerprinting analysis indicated that the populations are genetically differentiated from each other. Using a measure of coefficient of variation, the population with the highest variation was the Wondergat population (13. 99 %), followed by the Klerkskraal popUlation (8. 29 %), the Malmani and Marico Oog populations (each with 5. 88 %) and the least variation (4. 95 and 4. 83 %) was with the Amalinda and Molopo Oog populations respectively. This high degree of intra population similarity points to the fact that this differentiation is still confined within the limits of con specificity. The genetic distances between all of the T. sparrmanii populations across all primers ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 234 and averaged 0. 146, a value that falls in the upper end of conspecific population differentiation. Such results indicate populational sub-division below the species level. RAPD fingerprinting therefore proved more sensitive than protein or mitochondrial studies. The differentiation it detected between the populations is a reflection of their adaptation to local conditions of the unique ecosystems they inhabit. A comparison with a subset of primers between T. guinasana and T. sparrmanii confirmed the separate species status of the former from the latter. The mean genetic distance between the T. sparrmanii populations was 0. 136, compared to that between T. sparrmanii and T. guinasana which was found to be 0. 374. Statistical analysis of the difference between the mean genetic distances indicated significance with 95 % confidence. The polychromatism of T guinasana was investigated to determine whether there were significant differences between its five colour morphs. RAPD fingerprinting indicated with 95 % confidence that there were significant differences between the colour forms based on the genetic distances computed between them. These genetic differences appeared to correlate with the observed assortative <b>mating</b> between the <b>colour</b> forms of the species. The manifestation of the polychromatism at sexual maturity in T guinasana probably indicates that colouration plays an important role in the breeding process. The genetic uniqueness shown here between the populations of T sparrmanii and the colour forms of T guinasana indicate for protective measures to be put in place if the genetic resources of the isolated fish populations are to be preserved. These must be coupled with a thorough assessment of the temporal and spatial distribution of genetic variability of the populations as a guide to a long-term management strategy for the fish populations and the ecosystems they inhabit. This study therefore has shown that the allopatric populations of T sparrmanii in the sinkholes and springs of the North-West Province are genetically unique, as well as show that the colour forms of T guinasana are genetically distinct...|$|R
