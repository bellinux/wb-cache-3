5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two components.|$|E
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known mesons.|$|E

5|$|The {{table to}} the right lists the {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the critical <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E

The inner edge of the ring is in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the outer edge is in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε ring is estimated to be about 1016kg.|$|E

5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E
5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness {{because of one}} star passing {{in front of the}} other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E

5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 18th century, two laws about {{chemical}} reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products). The second was the law of definite proportions. First proven by the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust in 1799, this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working class of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed {{to be from the}} progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E
5|$|The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an average {{diameter}} of 203±3.6km. There are few large Jupiter trojans {{in comparison to the}} overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller Jupiter trojans.

5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects.

She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters.
