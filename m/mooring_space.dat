40|$|The {{shores of}} our oceans and Great Lakes have always carried {{an appeal to}} persons seeking escape from the {{pressures}} of work and routine. The shore is different and unique. It offers unlimited open space, tempering weather, and a refreshing feeling of freedom that makes its use for recreation a natural occurrence. But persons who {{want to use the}} shore for recreation often cannot. They may find that suitable space is too far away, too crowded, or simply not open to them. This is the issue of coastal recreation access. Access, {{for the purposes of this}} paper, can be defined as the ability to use the shore for recreation. Coastal access can be as simple as a visual openness to the water from public roads, unimpeded by structures, vegetation or topography. More often it is a complex mixture of legal restrictions, discriminatory attitudes, and physical barriers that keep large segments of our populace from enjoying the freedom of beach use. This paper will attempt to analyze the complex components of the recreational access issue. It will emphasize access to beaches [...] sandy shorefronts and related immediate uplands and dunes [...] because most coastal recreation takes place in these areas. Swimming, bathing, surfing, beachwalking, sunning, skindiving, jogging, picnicking, fishing, and many other recreational pursuits are best suited to beach areas. Boating, shellfishing, waterskiing, camping and sight seeing are among the coastal recreational activities that do not require sandy beach. These activities are included in this study to the extent that they are affected by restricted shore access. Problems of boat <b>mooring</b> <b>space,</b> benthic pollution, and competition among recreational uses of the shore are treated only superficially here, however, as these issues are complex in themselves and beyond the scope of this study. The nature and intensity of the problems comprising the access issue vary widely from state to state ·and between different regions within states. Reasons for this variation include physical area of beach, ownership patterns, geologic conditions, population density, and differences in laws and their interpretation by the courts. The access issue in some form is universal; it is most severe in the Northeast...|$|E
40|$|Private Mooring {{is one of}} mooring {{facilities}} {{available in}} the waters of Hong Kong. The characteristic of private moorings is it's allowing the owners to have an exclusive use of a particular approved water spaces. The Marine Department is responsible for the management of private moorings. In 2012, the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong SAR Government issued its report No. 59, which criticized the management of private moorings by the Marine Department. The report stated about the risk of subletting private moorings and advised the Marine Department should review the guidelines and administrative measure to regulate the situation. Since then, there were many media reported the development and problems of shortage of private mooring. The public concerns on the development of private moorings becomes a hot topic. Therefore, this study aims to examine the development & challenges of private moorings in Hong Kong. An individual interviews were conducted with the regulator, a marina club and a focus group. While a questionnaire was developed to gather quantitative data. Besides onsite observations were made to investigate the updated situation. Through various research methods were made, The updated situation of the development of private moorings has been found. The demand of private moorings is large and the waiting time of allocation of a private mooring is long. The reasons are sophisticated. The result of interviews and individual questionnaire showed {{there is a need to}} review the policy of private moorings. This dissertation recommended remedial measures through management, operation and planning. Because of limited resources, this study mainly investigates the popularly designated <b>mooring</b> <b>spaces</b> which are assigned to Class IV pleasure type vessel.

50|$|By way of illustration, by 1800 around 1,775 vessels had to <b>moor</b> in a <b>space</b> with {{capacity}} for only 545. The legal quays had not added any more frontage since 1666 and warehouse space was very limited. Congestion and delays were constant and chronic, with most vessels forced to unload while moored {{in the river}} rather than being able to moor alongside a quay. The long delays and lack of security led to widespread problems with theft and pilferage. The issue was eventually addressed {{with the construction of}} enclosed docks to the east of the City, notably on the Isle of Dogs and in Wapping, Blackwall and Rotherhithe, each with their own Legal Quays and secure bonded warehouses. The Customs Consolidation Act 1853 allowed Legal Quays and bonded warehouses to be built outside the docks, and by 1866, nearly 120 riverside wharves had obtained these privileges.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} on the study and comparison of different mooring/anchoring systems for offshore vessels in deep waters. FPSO’s (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading platforms), Light Weight Intervention vessels (LWI); Semi-submersible platforms and Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU) make use of efficient mooring/anchoring systems to provide {{a connection between the}} floating vessel and the sea bed. If a good mooring/anchoring system is not in place, the offshore vessel can drift off location and consequently cause damage to the vessel, riser, drill pipe and other associated equipment, thereby, compromising the safety of the asset and offshore personnel. Safety of the mooring/anchoring system is essential in order to guarantee successful marine operations. It is pertinent to have a strong mooring/anchoring system in order to secure the vessel against environmental forces and unplanned impact. As offshore technology is moving into deeper and deeper waters, there is an increasing challenge in the design of mooring/anchoring systems for offshore vessels. New technology, concepts, materials and sophisticated models showcasing the interaction between vessels and environment have been introduced. In this thesis, an investigation of the design and characteristics of different mooring/anchoring systems was carried out. The major tasks carried out in this thesis are listed below:  Review of different mooring and anchoring systems for offshore vessels.  Use of OrcaFlex software to perform dynamic analysis of different mooring lines to determine the design criteria for a range of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels.  Performing a SWOT analysis of the mooring line materials.  Calculating different forces and tensions on the mooring lines based on the prevailing environmental conditions in deep waters. The write-up begins with a review of different mooring and anchoring systems for offshore vessels followed by a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of different mooring line materials. A review of the regulations and standards governing the design and installation of mooring systems for offshore applications in different environments was also carried out. Different combination of mooring lines were used in this analysis to secure the vessel in position and the tensions obtained across the arc length of each mooring line are presented in the results. Three mooring line configuration cases were analyzed in this thesis. In the three cases, the offshore vessel is moored with eight symmetric <b>mooring</b> lines <b>spaced</b> 45 ° apart. The mooring lines configuration is Chain-Fiber rope–Chain in Case 1, Wire rope-Chain in Case 2, and Chain-Wire rope-Chain in case 3. The mooring geometry for all the cases is a catenary mooring system. The simulation uses regular waves acting on the vessel for the duration of 115 seconds. The mooring system employs a turret, located at the vessel’s moonpool. Since all mooring lines are connected to the turret, the vessel is free to rotate about the turret-wellhead axis and head into oncoming seas, regardless of direction. Thrusters are provided at the bow and stern to assist in maintaining a desired heading. The chain table connecting the mooring line to the turret is above the waterline. The wave theory used in the analysis is Dean Stream. The vessel used for the modelling is 103 m long and weighs 8800 tonnes. From the analysis carried out, it was observed that the maximum tension occurs at the turret end of the mooring lines. This is {{as a result of the}} vessel motions induced by environmental forces. The tensions obtained in Case 3 are quite high when compared to case 1 and case 2, but are still within acceptable limits as they are less than the minimum breaking loads of the mooring line materials used. It was also observed that Chain impose an enormous weight on the mooring line compared to fiber ropes consequently resulting to increased tension in the lines. The use of synthetic fiber rope in the configuration reduced the mooring weight and increases flexibility, thereby reducing the mooring line tensions. The advantages of each mooring/anchoring system are optimized while dispelling their disadvantages. Recommendations as regards the selection of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels operating in different environments are presented in this report. The results of the dynamic analysis can be used to determine the design criteria for a range of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels...|$|R
