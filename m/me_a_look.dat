500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Sabrina, Givenchy designed her costumes for Love in the Afternoon (1957), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Funny Face (1957), Charade (1963), Paris When It Sizzles (1964) and How to Steal a Million (1966), {{as well as}} clothed her off screen. According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn's films, stating that [...] "the costume is not tied to the character, functioning 'silently' in the mise-en-scène, but as 'fashion' becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right". Hepburn herself stated that Givenchy [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> a kind, a silhouette. He {{has always been the}} best and he stayed the best. Because he kept the spare style that I love. What is more beautiful than a simple sheath made an extraordinary way in a special fabric, and just two earrings?" [...] She also became the face of Givenchy's first perfume, L'Interdit, in 1957. In {{addition to}} her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of Burberry trench coats when she wore one in Breakfast at Tiffany's, and was associated with Italian footwear brand Tod's.|$|E
